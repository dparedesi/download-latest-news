Title: How spending two minutes picking up plastic on the beach can make a big difference

Headed to the beach this month? Chances are you’ll make a visit. A bracing swim, some fish and chips and a 99 are just the traditions to round out an Irish summer. But there’s something else you could make part of your beach routine and that’s a two-minute beach clean. This practice can go a long way towards making our beaches better. You’ll see all kinds of litter on a day at the beach. From food packaging and broken toys to discarded vapes and fishing and boating paraphernalia, marine litter comes from all sorts of land- and sea-based activities. What we see on the beach is only part of the problem, according to Beaches.ie, an initiative of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is estimated that 15 per cent of marine litter ends up on the sand, 15 per cent floats in the water and 70 per cent rests on the seabed. This stuff doesn’t just spoil the beauty of our beaches, it can harm marine life and their habitats too. Plastic litter kills an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and turtles worldwide every year. This includes 30,000 seals and up to a million seabirds, who either get entangled in it or eat it, according to Beaches.ie. In some areas, plastic accounts for 80 per cent of the litter and can remain in the marine environment for hundreds of years. That’s a day at the beach that isn’t getting forgotten any time soon. Marine experts fear there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, measured by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity working to end waste in the economy. Initiatives such as the #2MinuteBeachClean, operated as part of An Taisce’s Clean Coasts programme and supported by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Heritage is one way we can help stop the tide of litter. Spending just two minutes picking up the things we see at the beach can make a big difference. Not only will it make the beach a nicer place to be, but every piece of litter removed is a piece of litter that won’t pollute our oceans or be ingested by marine life. Taking just two minutes, each #2MinuteBeachClean is estimated to collect about 1-2kg of litter. If everybody in Ireland did a #2MinuteBeachClean per month, that would be more than 100,000 tonnes of litter removed from our ocean this year. Blue Flag beaches have #2minutebeachclean stations with bags and litter pickers you can borrow to make it easier to help keep our beaches litter free. You could do as some others are doing and take a photo of the litter and post it on social media (X or Instagram using the #2minutebeachclean) before putting the litter in the bin. [ Plastic colonialism: ‘A stream of plastic debris, stretching miles, is heading towards us’Opens in new window ] Search the #2minutebeachclean hashtag and you’ll find groups such as the Tomhaggard Clean Coasts group in Wexford, which removed 25 bags of waste at Carnsore in July. Their finds included a tyre and a lobster pot. Some 10 volunteers from the Blackrock Clean Up in Cork group gathered 11 bags of litter on one of the hottest days of the year. Clean Coasts Ballynamona, also in Cork, brought pupils from four primary schools to Garrylucas Beach in June. They gathered litter and learned about the importance of keeping their local beaches clean. Finds from two-minute beach cleaners include everything from a Die Hard DVD in Donabate to a Child of Prague statue, buried in the sand. So next time you visit the beach, whether you are going for a swim or walking the dog, think about joining the growing movement of people who are reducing marine litter, two minutes at a time. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Publisher Payment Plans; The Details Of Retail Data Deals

A Change Of Heart Publishers are hopeful that Meta may have changed its tune at least somewhat when it comes to how – or whether – the platform reimburses publishers for content contributed to its LLM models. Following up on an IAB Tech Lab event at which Meta and Google participated alongside publishers, Digiday reports on cautious optimism among pubs that Meta’s recent hiring spree of AI engineering leaders has led to a greater appreciation of the value of original written content. That’s quite a different vibe than Meta was putting out there as recently as last year. Last September, on The Verge’s Decoder podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that “creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content.” Reading between the lines, if creators don’t want to participate in feeding AI models because they’re not being properly compensated, then maybe the AI models will just skip over them. Although, not to be a cynic, that might be a moot point, considering all the data scraping that’s been going on. Also, we’ll believe it when we see it – publicly. “They [Meta] were very clear that their stance on this has changed,” one anonymous publisher tells Digiday. “Even though it may not have outwardly turned into action yet.” Data (Fee) Leak Times are tough for The Trade Desk. Its stock price sank after investors questioned its strategy for competing with walled gardens. Meanwhile, competitors are gunning for their slices of open web advertising and the growing CTV and retail media markets. Now, a document leak has revealed what advertisers pay for targeting data sourced from TTD’s retail media partners, Adweek reports. The document, which was last updated June 15, also includes the minimum ad spend required to create custom audiences or conduct campaign measurement using retailer data. When advertisers use retail media data to target ads, they pay the retailer a percentage of the campaign’s CPM capped at a set amount. For example, targeting with Costco’s data might cost 40% of the CPM, but won’t exceed $4 per 1,000 impressions. It’s unclear whether TTD keeps a portion of the data fees for itself. The hard caps are in place because CPMs are much higher for CTV ad buys than online display campaigns, and retail media data is commonly used for CTV targeting. The leak also sheds light on TTD’s no-longer-exclusive ad tech partnership with Walmart’s DSP, including a $150,000 spending minimum and a 75-cent CPM fee for sales lift measurement. However, Walmart says those are old figures, so it’ll be interesting to see what other DSPs will charge for Walmart’s data. Giving Privacy The Finger Fingerprinting has a bad reputation. But opinions on the controversial tracking strategy seem to be shifting. The IAB Tech Lab is even defending it. Audience fingerprinting identifies and tracks devices or users based on unique digital traits like browser settings and software and hardware configurations, without relying on cookies or device IDs. A fingerprint can include everything from web browser type and version, a device’s operating system, the size of the screen, language settings and many other signals. Platforms combine these data points, none of which alone can specifically identify a person, to create a probabilistic user ID. Critics say fingerprinting threatens user privacy, since people can’t opt out. Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft and others prohibit the practice. But Google, which also once banned fingerprinting, reversed course back in January. And now the IAB Tech Lab is also waving away concerns. At the AdMonsters Sell Side Summit in Nashville last week, Tech Lab CEO Anthony Katsur gave a rundown of the trade org’s recent initiatives, including its new Trusted Server framework. In describing how the server uses first-party data to create synthetic IDs, Katsur acknowledged, but also diminished, criticisms that the framework promotes fingerprinting – perhaps drawing on his tense exchange with Sincera’s Mike O’Sullivan in March. “Oh, it’s fingerprinting,” he said in a mocking tone. “Sure, let’s fucking call it fingerprinting.” You heard the man! But Wait! There’s More! Publishers sing the AI scraping blues and detail their diversification efforts at Sell Side Summit Nashville. [AdMonsters] OpenAI has been using data from Google search results to power ChatGPT. [The Information] A sign of the times: Digg, once billed as the “front page of the internet,” is relaunching as an app-focused experience. [The Verge] Y Combinator claims that Apple’s App Store has hindered startup growth. [TechCrunch] And now for something that anyone with a social media account already knows: AI is bad at moderating online communities. [Bloomberg] Nostalgia for a simpler, algorithm-free internet is at an all-time high. [Business Insider] You’re Hired!

Title: Faraday Future Founder and Co-CEO YT Jia Shares Weekly Investor Update

August 24, 2025 23:54 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “This is our 17th weekly update. Many of you have asked whether our “Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge” eco-strategy could lead to distraction or drift. In fact, it is the opposite. This is not about losing focus, but about strengthening our foundation. Automaking is a long-cycle, high-investment, and slow-return industry. One of the core challenges FF is facing is that: before hitting positive operating cash flow, how do promote long-term and stable capital supply. Our C10 Treasury is designed for this. By accumulating and compounding the world’s Top 10 crypto coin portfolio, it has the potential to provide continuous and sustained capital support for our main business — EAI EV, truly delivering dual-engine growth from both capital and industry.” On Friday last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that a rate cut may come as early as September. His remarks gave a major boost to capital markets. U.S. equities moved higher, while crypto reacted faster and stronger. The market priced in liquidity easing more directly, creating a clear upside for our C10 Treasury, as the C10 Index was up nearly 6% on Friday. This week, both flywheels achieved important progress: On S1 User Ecosystem: The influence of our “Dual Flywheel + Dual Bridge” unveiling event continues to grow in the U.S. It has sparked meta-chemistry. Cross-sector outreach in automotive, finance, and Web3 created a multi-domain resonance. As a result, FF and FX received cross-industry attention that far exceeded expectations. We will double our efforts to quickly elevate FF and FX’s influence in the U.S. market to another level. Looking at S2–S3: Product & Technology:This week, FX Super One successfully completed the first round of development tests for occupant upper interior impact protection under U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). FMVSS is recognized as one of the world’s most complete and rigorous automotive safety regulations. It is a prerequisite for entering the U.S. market and also sets standards for automotive design, manufacturing, and testing worldwide. FX Super One must meet the requirements of the U.S., the Middle East, and future global markets. This requires testing at the highest standards. We will continue advancing vehicle testing, development, and validation to build a strong foundation for Super One’s high safety standards. Moving on to S4, Product Execution & Delivery: This week, we visited the Hanford manufacturing facility to oversee FX Super One’s trial production. Thanks to the hard work of our manufacturing team, around 60% of the trial production process planning has already been completed. Next, the team will continue comprehensive validation of production processes, refine work procedures, establish and enhance the quality control system, and carry out dedicated skill training in parallel. Lastly, on S5 Capital Markets and finance:The first dedicated $30 million financing commitment for C10 Treasury closed this week. We expect to begin the first round of asset allocation next week. Our plan is to gradually deploy the full $30 million over the coming weeks. 80% will be allocated passively according to the C10 Index, while 20% will be actively managed. We will share portfolio holdings and performance updates in future weekly reports. C10 Treasury, as a short-cycle, fast-paced, high-value, and cash-cow investment due to steady staking interests, could serve as the financial engine of the entire listed company FFAI, and help accelerate the implementation and execution of the EAI EV strategy. Next week:Our Super One co-creation and sales campaign will officially kick off across eight U.S. states. Over the next weekend, I will make a short trip to the Nevada desert, bringing FX Super One to Burning Man. We also plan to announce an important update there. Burning Man has become a global utopia where leading minds in technology, art, and business pursue creativity and idealism. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are regulars there, and Google’s founders once recruited Eric Schmidt at Burning Man. Schmidt went on to lead Google for a decade, driving its rapid expansion and cementing Google’s dominance in the Web2 era. Starting August 28, Super One will also make its debut in Massachusetts, where we and our FF Par partners will host two consecutive co-creation and sales events in the Boston area. At the same time, our New York–based B2B partner Alps will launch a week-long roadshow campaign. On August 30, FF headquarters will host a special event — the inaugural North America “Go-Global Stand-Up Comedy Festival” and FX Super One Showcase. Joe Wong, the first Chinese stand-up comedian to have roasted a U.S. president live at the White House, will join entrepreneurs, founders, and global expansion pioneers for co-creation and exchange. We will see you next week!” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Business FILE PHOTO: Mizuho Bank's signboard is pictured in Tokyo, Japan, January 25, 2017. Picture taken January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File photo LONDON/TOKYO :Japanese banks Mizuho and MUFG are targeting buying or partnering with overseas money managers, they told Reuters, joining other Japanese financial companies aiming for a larger share of the global investing market. Mizuho is prioritising a tie-up with a private asset specialist in Europe or the United States to give it a foothold in areas such as the booming credit market or infrastructure financing, an executive told Reuters. MUFG, meanwhile, has identified overseas asset management - particularly in the United States and Europe - as a priority area for potential deals, the company said. The banks, two of the largest in Japan, collectively manage about $1.3 trillion through their asset management arms, largely for local clients. They declined to comment on whether discussions with target companies had already taken place and there is no certainty transactions will happen.

"As we look to become a more global business, Europe is a very important starting point for us," Gardiner said, adding it was also targeting growth via a distribution arrangement with U.S. bank Morgan Stanley - in which MUFG has a 23.6 per cent stake.

Title: Dow eyes fresh highs as Nvidia gets set to report earnings amid AI bubble fears

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Stock futures edged up on Sunday evening as Wall Street looks ahead to another big week that will feature earnings from AI chip leader Nvidia and another inflation update. Markets are coming off a monster rally on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a rate cut next month. Futures tied to the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24 points, or 0.05%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.05%, and Nasdaq futures added 0.06%. On Friday, the Dow hit a new all-time high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed in on their records. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was flat at 4.256% after diving Friday on rate-cut expectations. The U.S. dollar was down 0.02% against the euro and flat against the yen. Gold fell 0.13% to $3,413.80 per ounce. U.S. oil prices rose 0.2% to $63.79 per barrel, and Brent crude added 0.15% to reach $67.83. Friday’s stock surge came after a big selloff that was led by tech giants, as doubts have grown about the AI boom and how much it will actually help companies. That’s after a recent report from MIT found that 95% of AI pilot programs at businesses are failing to produce much of a return. Adding to those concerns were remarks from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who drew a parallel between today’s AI frenzy and the 1990s dotcom bubble. Wall Street’s faith in the staying power of AI as an investment thesis will be put to the test when Nvidia reports quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday. The report also comes after Nvidia and AMD agreed to an unprecedented deal where they give the federal government a 15% cut of their chip sales to China. For now, demand from U.S. companies remains high as so-called hyperscaler tech giants Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms alone are expected to deploy $400 billion in capital expenditures this year, and most of that is going to AI. On Friday, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is due as policymakers wait and see how much of an effect on inflation President Donald Trump’s tariffs are having. Earlier updates on the consumer price index and the producer price index were mixed, and analysts expect the personal consumption expenditures index for July to rise 0.2% on a monthly basis and 2.6% on a yearly basis, the same annual rate as June. But the core PCE is seen climbing 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.9% on a yearly basis, accelerating from June’s 2.8% annual rate. Still, some Fed officials, including Powell, have indicated that tariff-related impacts on inflation may be short-term and that more attention should go to the labor market, which has shown signs of weakening. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bitcoin volatility keeps falling, and that means it’s maturing as an asset class

Bitcoin volatility has dropped to a five-year low as the number-one crypto matures, showing more price predictability than blue-chip tech stocks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The world’s number-one crypto is looking more like a mature asset class every day as Bitcoin volatility continues to drop (yes, even as it blasts past all-time highs and promptly retraces its steps). Bitcoin has long been regarded as one of the most volatile financial assets; its turbulent price fluctuations over the years have deterred many investors. But what if I told you that Bitcoin is now less volatile than a blue-chip tech stock? According to ecoinometrics, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility is now at its lowest point in nearly five years, and it’s a trend that has persisted even through Bitcoin’s headline-making rallies and corrections over the last five years: “Exactly what you expect from a maturing asset.” Since 2022, Bitcoin has often been less volatile than some of Wall Street’s biggest names, including mega-cap stocks like Nvidia. During the sharp tech sector swings of 2023 and 2024, Nvidia’s price was more unpredictable than Bitcoin, an asset infamous for its hair-raising moves. Even during this current Bitcoin bull run, the price swings have remained notably tamer than previous cycles. Macro analyst Lyn Alden recently told CryptoSlate she believes that Bitcoin’s cycles are changing. We should expect this one to be longer and “less extreme” than previous runs, with strong moves upward followed by periods of consolidation, “rather than going to the moon and collapsing.” Bitcoin volatility declining is just one marker of its growing maturity. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in early 2024 was a landmark event, opening up the asset to the mainstream audience. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity offer direct Bitcoin exposure to retail and institutional investors through regulated exchange-traded products. This has introduced broader ownership and liquidity, dampening large price swings and integrating Bitcoin more deeply into traditional markets. Moreover, recent regulatory changes now allow Americans to include Bitcoin in their 401k retirement accounts. As diversified portfolios absorb BTC allocations, Bitcoin volatility further subsides. Pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies have begun allocating to Bitcoin as part of their alternative asset strategies. This increases trading by sophisticated investors and reduces the impact of short-term speculative flows. Increasingly, Bitcoin’s price shows a higher correlation with broader equity markets during risk-on and risk-off periods, another sign of integration and maturity. While you can argue whether this is what we intended for Bitcoin, it does reflect mainstream market adoption. And hey, strong-willed kids become adults who change the world, as Bitcoin is undoubtedly doing. For everyday investors and institutions alike, lower Bitcoin volatility translates to less risk and a smoother investment profile. It’s also a sign that Bitcoin is outgrowing its adolescent phase of wild speculative swings and turbulence, and settling into its role as a legitimate member of society and staple of diversified portfolios.

Title: The Fed Just Shifted On Inflation: What It Means For Your Portfolio

ByRobert Daugherty, Contributor. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent equity markets higher last week with a subtle but important shift in tone. In his remarks, Powell signaled easier monetary conditions ahead and, more significantly, the Fed walked back its ill-fated 2020 policy “framework” that tolerated higher inflation. That experiment called “flexible average inflation targeting” was intended to balance past undershoots of the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Instead, it coincided with pandemic stimulus, supply chain shocks, and soaring demand, producing the worst bout of inflation since the 1970s. At its peak in June 2022, consumer prices were rising at 9.1%. Now the Fed is returning to its more traditional stance: flexible but committed to keeping inflation anchored around 2%. The pivot is not just technocratic fine print it reshapes the environment for investors deciding how to protect and grow wealth in a world of shifting policy, uncertain growth, and still-present inflation risks. And here lies the central paradox: while Fed decisions influence short-term interest rates and bond yields, history shows that equities ownership in real businesses have consistently been the most resilient asset class in inflationary and post-inflationary cycles. If you want to beat inflation, you need to own things that grow faster than inflation. That means stocks. Below are seven principles that explain why. Unlike bonds, which pay fixed coupons eroded by inflation, stocks represent claims on companies with pricing power, tangible assets, and the ability to adjust. Firms raise prices, increase productivity, and expand into new markets. Look no further than the S&P 500 chart versus New York Times front-page headlines: even amid tariff battles, political turmoil, and Fed chatter, stocks marched higher. The lesson is simple: money isn’t made on the front page, it’s made by owning real businesses that compound value behind the headlines. Reinvestment of dividends has historically accounted for the majority of equity market returns. In inflationary periods, strong companies tend to boost dividends to keep pace with rising earnings. The S&P’s 10 largest dividend payers today span sectors from financials to energy and illustrate the built-in inflation adjustment of equities. Bonds can’t raise coupons; stocks can raise dividends, often faster than inflation. Inflation reflects money losing value. Innovation reflects society creating new value. From railroads to semiconductors to artificial intelligence, the U.S. stock market has rewarded investors who align with companies driving productivity forward. The data is striking: Nvidia (NVDA) has delivered a 31,480% return in the last decade alone, while Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon continue to reinvent themselves. The biggest winners can come from anywhere. What is the common denominator of Monster Beverage, Deckers Outdoor, Tractor Supply? Innovation that beats inflation by creating entirely new categories of value. The academic evidence is overwhelming: over long periods, equities deliver positive real (inflation-adjusted) returns, while bonds often fail to keep up. Take the Fed’s last great inflation fight in the 1970s. Bonds delivered negative real returns, while equities, though volatile, ultimately rewarded long-term investors. More recently, the S&P 500’s equal-weight return since 1999 outpaced most of the decade’s “blue chips.” The lesson: bonds are ballast, but equities are the engine. Today’s investors aren’t confined to U.S. companies. They can own world-class businesses across developed and emerging markets. Multinationals often operate in dozens of countries, giving them natural hedges against inflation in any single economy. And crucially, leadership shifts. Some of the top 10 companies of 2000 were GE, Cisco, and Intel, but all have mostly lagged the index in the decades that followed. Only Microsoft and Walmart held up. Meanwhile, today’s top names such as Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia have emerged from outside the spotlight. Today’s leaders are unlikely to be tomorrow’s. That’s good news for investors willing to look beyond the obvious. Inflation penalizes savers, but it can accelerate revenue growth for companies with strong brands, cost discipline, or control of scarce resources. Consumer giants pass on higher prices. Energy producers benefit from commodity cycles. Healthcare innovators raise pricing power with each breakthrough. Even if nine out of ten “longshot” stock bets fail, the one winner can carry a portfolio. In a basket of 10 speculative names, nine could fall 90%, but one rallying 1,000% would still produce a positive return. Inflation hurts many but it rewards the scarce few who can adapt, and those are precisely the firms that dominate stock returns. The Fed’s pivot may change quarterly forecasts, but investors with a 10- or 20-year horizon operate on a different plane. Over any rolling 20-year period in U.S. history, equities have delivered positive real returns, regardless of inflation or monetary cycles. The catch? You need the stomach for volatility. The best-performing stocks of the last 25 years are Nvidia, Amazon, Apple which spent long stretches down 50% or more from prior highs. Nvidia itself has been in a 50% drawdown 43% of all trading days in the past 25 years. The courage to stay invested separates those who enjoy compounding from those who sell at the worst time. Powell’s reversal of the 2020 “average inflation targeting” experiment is a reminder that even central banks armed with PhDs and data sometimes adopt frameworks that don’t hold up in practice. For investors, the lesson is humility: don’t bet your future on monetary engineering. Instead, bet on the enduring ability of human ingenuity, enterprise, and markets to create value over time. Bonds can offer ballast, cash can provide optionality, and alternatives like real estate or commodities can hedge. But the core of any inflation-resistant portfolio remains equities. The Fed will continue to revise its frameworks. Investors should not. The principle is timeless: own businesses, stay invested, reinvest cash flows, and let compounding do the work. Inflation is an adversary, but stocks remain the proven defense.

Title: Reading The Tea Leaves: Implications Of Fed Chair Powell’s Speech
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/24/reading-the-tea-leaves-implications-of-fed-chair-powells-speech/
Time Published: 2025-08-24T13:30:32Z
Full Content:
ByBill Stone, Contributor. Federal Reserve Chair Powell spoke on Friday at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole conference. His comments were widely anticipated since this conference is often the site of momentous policy shifts, and the US economic growth has slowed while inflation risks remain. Powell almost certainly saw last month’s soft employment report with its massive negative revisions as an economic warning. He noted in his comments that “downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.” Regarding inflation, Powell said that tariffs will likely result in a “one-time shift in the price level” despite some risk of a “more lasting inflation dynamic.” Notably, he referred back to the softening labor market when noting that inflation from “adverse wage-price dynamics” seems unlikely because the job market is “not particularly tight.” Notably, Powell spoke about the labor market before inflation in his speech, hinting at his shift in priorities. In judging the policy implications of his Jackson Hole speech, two additional phrases are key. He noted that “the baseline outlook and shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” and the Fed can “proceed carefully as we consider our changes to our policy stance.” Adding it all together, a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut at the Fed’s September 17 meeting is now the base case. The Fed fund futures market priced in an 81% chance of that 25 basis point cut at the September meeting following Powell’s remarks. The odds would likely be higher, but the August monthly jobs report is released on September 5 and could have an outsized impact on the rate cut probabilities. The S&P 500’s small gain for the week is deceiving, as the index closed lower in the first four days of the trading week before rising by 1.5% following Powell’s comments on Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), was lower for the week but rebounded by 2.5% on Friday. Notably, smaller companies, as represented by the Russell Midcap Russell 2000 Smallcap, are considered more domestically focused and economically sensitive and outperformed last week. Further, banks had a stellar week and are also economically sensitive, as they typically receive a boost from better economic outlooks. The betting markets lowered the odds of a US recession to 11% in 2025, and in their typical reaction, this year stocks rose. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. While there are several typically impactful economic releases this week, Fed Chair Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole should send the primary focus to next week’s monthly jobs report on September 5. It would likely take well above consensus job growth to change expectations from a September Fed rate cut, but it will be the crucial data to inform the committee’s decision. Monitoring Fedspeak this week will be important to listen for any walking back of most market participants’ dovish interpretation of Powell’s comments. As a leading candidate to be the next Fed Chair, Governor Waller’s comments on Thursday evening will be notable. Higher frequency labor market data should be monitored for further economic clues. Initial claims for unemployment benefits have been moving higher. Continuing claims for jobless benefits are at a multi-year high, indicating that people losing jobs are having a harder time regaining employment. Tariff headlines remain important market movers, as they impact economic expectations and have inflation implications for the Fed. In addition, there are fifteen companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings – most importantly, Nvidia (NVDA) will release its earnings on Wednesday after market close. With artificial intelligence (AI) spending key to technology sector earnings, Nvidia’s earnings and outlook are a critical market indicator. Barring a sizable upside surprise to job growth in the September 5 monthly jobs report, Chair Powell set the stage for a 25 basis point interest rate cut at the Fed’s meeting on September 17. Stocks reacted favorably as it raised the odds that the US might avoid the softening economy descending into recession. The current level of short-term interest rates is restrictive, and monetary policy works with long and variable lags, so the central bank must act before economic conditions deteriorate too much.

Title: Wall Street Can’t Stand This 12%-Yielding Bear Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/08/24/wall-street-cant-stand-this-12-yielding-bear-portfolio/

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Let’s talk about three dividends averaging 12%. I bring them up because everyone on Wall Street hates them. This is notable because the suits are paid to be bullish. Sell calls are rare, especially among S&P 500 stocks. In fact, analysts shun just one index component today! Buy calls? They are numerous—405 out of 500. Eighty-one percent! Are 81% of the companies in the S&P 500 really buys? Normally, no, but now—especially not. AI is disrupting business models and many of these Buy-rated names are doomed companies. Here’s another problem with Buy ratings—there is no room for improvement. Sells are better. They set the stage for upgrades! And it doesn’t take much for analysts to flip a stock from a Sell to a Buy. Which is why savvy contrarians dig through the Sell bin. Today we’ll discuss three hated names yielding from 6.1% to 15.7%. Before getting to those, let’s use Prospect Capital (PSEC, 18.7% yield), as a cautionary tale and highlight the difference between being contrarian and being foolish. PSEC is a business development company (BDC) that provides capital to middle-market companies, primarily through first lien and other secured debt. It has a diverse portfolio of 114 companies across 33 industries. And it’s one of the largest BDCs at well more than $1 billion in market cap. But despite being a monthly dividend payer with a yield that could be confused for a credit card APR, and despite being the cheapest BDC on the market, Wall Street can’t find a reason to like it. It has just two covering analysts, and only one of them has a rating on the stock (Sell, unsurprisingly). While that smacks of too small a sample size, the lack of coverage itself is telling. Research firms would prefer not to bite the hands that provide them with access, to the point where many would choose to temporarily stop covering a company over calling a spade a spade. Why the lack of love? Among other reasons, how about three dividend cuts in the past decade, including a 25% reduction less than a year ago. All right. What about a BDC with a slightly less bearish camp? BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC, 15.7% yield) is technically a consensus Sell call, but the majority of analysts covering it say it’s a Hold. So at least as far as pro ratings go, it’s not a disaster. TCPC is a middle-market lender that prefers companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $1.5 billion. It currently boasts more than 150 portfolio companies across 20 different industries, and its deal mix is heaviest (82%) in first-lien debt, and the vast majority (94%) of its lending is floating-rate in nature. The case for BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. is BlackRock. The BDC is externally managed by a BlackRock subsidiary, which gives it access to BlackRock resources. In theory, that should make TCPC competitive. Again, the pros likely have a legitimate case here. TCPC is in the process of restructuring deals amid credit issues in the portfolio, and management fees have been waived to make up for some of the financial slack. The dividend—which BlackRock TPC cut earlier this year, just a few months after I flagged the potentially brewing trouble in its distribution—isn’t necessarily at risk yet, but it bears watching if portfolio losses continue. Hated BDCs might be asking for it. Let’s look at other high-yield acronyms instead. Cheniere Energy Partners LP (CQP, 6.1% yield) is a midstream subsidiary of Cheniere Energy (LNG). It owns the Sabine Pass LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminal in Louisiana, which includes natural gas liquefaction facilities and regasification facilities. It also owns the Creole Trail Pipelines, which connects the Sabine Pass terminal with inter- and intrastate pipelines. Cheniere Partners owns the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which has natural gas liquefaction facilities with a total production capacity of over 30 mtpa of LNG. The Sabine Pass LNG terminal also has operational regasification facilities that include five LNG storage tanks, vaporizers, and three marine berths. Cheniere Partners also owns a Corpus Christi liquefaction facility and a connected pipeline, as well as Creole Trail Pipeline, which interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate and intrastate pipelines. CQP is pouring itself into expansions at its Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi facilities—big capital outlays that required Cheniere to reduce its variable distribution in 2024. That payout came up a smidge earlier this year, however, and the company’s underperformance last year has turned into more respectable performance this year. There’s no telling what the master limited partnership (MLP) will do in the short term as its various project details are fleshed out. But if these projects do bear fruit, CQP could be looking at a potential explosion of distributable cash flow (DCF) generation a few years down the road. How about a real estate investment trust (REIT)? Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR, 14.4% yield), a REIT tied to the marijuana industry, is what I call a “bearish Hold.” Most of the pros say it’s a Hold or a Sell, but a lone Buy call raises its consensus average. Still, Wall Street really doesn’t like this stock—a massive change of fortune to a stock that over the past decade has been among both the sector’s biggest success stories and its biggest flops. IIPR provides capital for the regulated cannabis industry through a sale-leaseback program. It buys freestanding industrial and retail properties (most of which are marijuana growth facilities) from cannabis operators, then leases them right back to the sellers. This provides cannabis operators with much-needed influxes of cash that they can use to expand their operations, and provides the REIT with ongoing cash flow. Currently, IIPR owns 108 properties in 19 states, representing nearly 9 million square feet, which it leases out to 36 tenants. It’s not like Innovative Industrial Properties has operationally reverted to where it was 10 years ago—not even close. The company went public in 2016 and generated negative $7.5 million in funds from operations (FFO). It has cleared $210 million in FFO in each of the past three years, including $231 million in 2023 and $230 million in 2024. However, the stock exploded even more than the business did, and the past few years have seen shares come back to earth. And everything’s not exactly rosy in the core business, which still is dealing with a cracked, state-by-state regulatory environment. That’s a big reason why IIPR recently invested $270 million into IQHQ, a life science real estate platform with more than $2 billion in assets—a move that could provide much-needed stability and growth. It’s worth noting, however, that FFO has been declining significantly over the past few quarters, driving its adjusted FFO payout ratio to nearly 95%; that’s uncomfortably higher than the 85% ratio IIPR averaged between 2017 and 2024.

Title: Ripple’s XRP Breaks Into Top 100 Global Assets With $180 Billion Market Cap

Ripple’s XRP has officially broken into the top 100 global assets by market capitalization, a milestone that places it alongside some of the world’s most valuable companies like Shopify, Intuit, and Deutsche Telekom. According to the latest data, XRP holds a market cap of around $181.2 billion at a price of $3.02 per token, ranking it above 100th on the global leaderboard. More notably, XRP has managed to join this exclusive list without the backing of a regulated spot ETF in the United States, unlike its crypto counterparts Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are also on the list of the largest global assets. At the time of writing, XRP is the 97th largest asset by market cap, the third cryptocurrency in the list behind Bitcoin at 7th and Ethereum at 22nd. XRP’s climb to this milestone can be traced to a wave of inflows that have been pouring into the asset in recent months. The scale of these inflows has been enough to push XRP’s market cap above BNB and stablecoin Tether USDT, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Institutional and retail investors have been drawn to XRP following the conclusion of its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This confidence, combined with the larger crypto market bullishness, has seen the XRP price establish a new support base at $3. Crossing into the ranks of the world’s top 100 assets shows how XRP is faring compared to companies outside the cryptocurrency market. At its current valuation, XRP is now on the tails of some of the most recognized global corporations, like Verizon, Texas Instruments, Shopify, and Intuit. Top assets by market cap: CompaniesMarketCap Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained tremendous institutional traction in the past 18 months or so through the launch of regulated spot ETFs in the United States. XRP, on the other hand, has reached its current standing without such an instrument. Therefore, XRP’s present milestone may be just the start of a much larger climb. The absence of ETF-driven inflows means that XRP has significant untapped potential waiting to be unlocked through financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale once regulatory approval for a Spot XRP ETF arrives in the US. Such a trading instrument would open the door for large-scale institutional investors who have so far been restricted in accessing XRP exposure. If the same inflow patterns seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are seen again with XRP, its market capitalization could easily push past its current peers in the top 100 global asset rankings alongside its price. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.04. Expectations tied to the eventual approval of Spot XRP ETFs stretch from moderate projections of $4 to ambitious forecasts of as high as $1,000.

Title: ETFs and 401(k)s Don’t Play. Could Dual Share Classes Change That?
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/advisor/industry-news/etfs-and-401ks-dont-play-could-dual-share-classes-change-that/
Time Published: 2025-08-24T12:00:00Z

Intraday trading and other ETF features aren’t designed for 401(k)s, but mutual fund share classes could give ETF issuers an in. At least one shop has hopes for that. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com If ETFs were a square peg, 401(k)s might be round holes — round holes with perimeters guarded by motion-sensing lasers, trapdoors and werewolves. They simply aren’t getting in. At least, not as standalone investment options on plan menus. It’s a roughly $12 trillion market that is off limits, with a couple of exceptions: Some defined-contribution plans have brokerage windows that few investors use; and some plans include asset-allocation products that have exposure to ETFs. For a lot of asset managers, it’s not really a problem, as they provide strategies in a range of vehicles, including mutual funds, ETFs and collective investment trusts. But for companies whose focus is on ETFs, it’s a missed opportunity. “ETFs are really made for the retail market,” said Greg Ungerman, head of defined contribution research and consulting at Callan. “There are a lot of tax advantages vis-à-vis a mutual fund.” ETFs’ tax benefits don’t matter within tax-deferred plans like 401(k)s. And while ETFs offer low costs, the institutional-level pricing of mutual fund shares and CITs in defined-contribution plans is extremely hard to compete with. For example, Ungerman said, the bargain-price 9 basis-point fee for the $650 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) has nothing on the comparable index funds available to defined-contribution plans for 1 basis point or less. Some of the other hindrances include: It wasn’t always this way. There was some excitement about the potential for ETFs in 401(k)s as much as 20 years ago, just before the Pension Protection Act of 2006 changed everything. Unlike many mutual funds at the time, ETFs, still far less common than they are today, had “clean” fee structures, meaning that they didn’t include revenue sharing or 12b-1 fees. ETF providers pushed 401(k) recordkeepers to make their systems compatible, to no avail, said Fred Barstein, founder of The Retirement Advisor University. “There was no demand. There was very little difference [plan fiduciaries] could tell at the time between an index fund and an ETF,” he said. A major issue comes from the 2006 Pension Protection Act, which allowed for automatic enrollment and helped buoy target-date funds as the default investment options in defined-contribution plans. Thanks to automatic enrollment (and the fact that workers interact little with their accounts), about 70% of the new money contributed to 401(k) accounts goes into target-date funds, Barstein noted. While ETFs are included in some target-date products, there’s otherwise “zero talk of ETFs in 401(k)s,” he said. And while some target-date fund providers use outside managers’ ETFs within their products, most of the big ones invest with in-house ETFs — meaning that opportunity in that avenue is limited. Of 156 target-date series that Sway Research tracks, 10 include allocations to ETFs and mutual funds, while seven hold ETFs exclusively, said Chris Brown, principal of that firm. Less than 3% of target-date CITs hold ETFs, while mutual fund series are much more likely to include ETFs, he said. All of the seven series that hold ETFs exclusively use asset managers’ own funds, and only a few of those that use a mix of mutual funds and ETFs use outside products. ETFs “really haven’t penetrated the target-date market much at all,” Brown said. “It’s kind of surprising.” Where they have found a niche, though, is in active-passive hybrid series, where managers add third-party index-based ETFs to diversify and lower costs, he noted. Some of the series that significantly use ETFs, per Sway: One ETF shop is trying something different. F/m Investments is among dozens of asset managers waiting for permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to add dual share classes, something the regulator is expected to grant this year. Most companies are seeking to add ETF share classes of existing mutual fund strategies, but F/m is doing the opposite, with the intention of landing spots for some of its products on defined-contribution plan menus. “Loads of DC buyers have said, ‘Why can’t we buy your products?’” F/m’s CEO Alex Morris said. But the company has refused to launch separate mutual fund versions of its ETFs because the performances of the two vehicles might diverge significantly due to the differences in trading, he said. The company is planning to start with mutual fund share classes of two of its ETFs and one ETF share class of an existing mutual fund. “Everyone is thinking it’s going to be this deluge, day one,” Morris said. “It’s actually kind of hard” to add a share class that’s a different investment vehicle, and “there’s a lot behind it that most issuers haven’t thought about.” At F/m, that has meant working with fund administration and accounting to keep track of capital gains, update baskets in real time and figure out what to put on the firm’s website, he said. Footing T-Bill. The first mutual fund shares the firm plans to roll out are for its F/m US Treasury 3-Month Bill ETF (TBIL) and Ultrashort Treasury Inflation-Protected Security ETF (RBIL). “ETFs have this super power,” Morris said. “In a mutual fund executing a T-Bill strategy, I need to put all the dealers I know in competition with each other … Here, every market maker is bidding on that ETF everyday,” he added. “You’re going to get a better price experience from that. You get to choose the price you pay.” After several funds from the startup Yieldstreet resulted in total losses, experts questioned the role of private investments in client portfolios. With costs of living surging, some states fare better than others when it comes to retirement. The development illustrates Vanguard’s ongoing dominance in ETFs as well as client demand for low-cost, passive strategies. The tech analyst said his taste in fashion mirrors his team’s out-of-the-box stock picking philosophy. There have been reports of advisors leaving, as well as a race among competitors for the industry talent that went up for grabs. The investor protection organization wants its advertising rules to align more closely with federal standards. The industry is far from parity, but progress has been made over the past decade. Experts said the GENIUS Act, signed into law this month, will make advisors more confident about getting into digital currencies. Finalized last summer, the proposal intends to address issues like terrorist financing and foreign corruption in America’s advisory industry. Golfing and camping topped the list, according to a recent AdvizorPro survey. The complaint alleges Vanguard acted in bad faith by thwarting certain business deals post-acquisition. The firm said the funding will go toward acquisitions and tech innovation. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. New trends are shaking up the market, setting the stage for a shift in focus. Popular online tokens, new tech for digital infrastructure, and real-world asset platforms are now leading stories. Every project fights for attention as the next big thing. Find out which narratives are poised to grab the spotlight during this booming season. TAO powers Bittensor, a public network where many small brains work as one big brain. Each model shares its best ideas, learns from others, and earns TAO when its answers help the group. People outside the network can ask questions, guide tasks, and pay in the same coin. Because the code is open and the rules live on a blockchain, anyone, anywhere, can join, build, and own a piece of the growing mind. AI coins are hot this cycle, yet many just chase buzzwords. TAO stands apart because it already links real work to real pay. Bitcoin secures money, Ethereum runs apps, but TAO rewards thought. Its fixed supply and steady demand for learning may support price even in storms. Big firms now spend fortunes on data and chips; Bittensor taps global hobby rigs for the same goal and shares the gains. If the market continues to favor useful networks over hype, TAO could transition from a niche idea to a core holding. Hedera Hashgraph does not use a classic blockchain. It runs on a “hashgraph,” where computers share tiny pieces of data instead of bulky blocks. This design requires no mining, which saves energy and lowers fees. Each HBAR pays for actions on the network and helps guard it through Proof of Stake. The result is quick, cheap moves for payments, games, and even stock trades. Big names—like Google and IBM—sit on its council, adding trust and money to the project. Today’s market rewards coins that cut costs and waste. Bitcoin is strong but slow. Ethereum becomes busy and expensive during traffic spikes. New rivals such as Solana promise speed but battle outages. HBAR handles a high volume of deals per second effortlessly and keeps fees under a penny. Its code is patented, which may slow open-source fans, yet it also sets Hedera apart in a crowded field. With eco talk rising and firms seeking stable rails, HBAR looks well placed for the next upswing. XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first-ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of Web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional players. In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Ondo Finance mixes the trust of old fintech with the speed of blockchain. It converts safe assets, such as US Treasury bills, into digital tokens that anyone can hold. Two teams drive this plan. One builds the products, the other codes the tech that lets them move with ease. Strong names back the project. BlackRock handles the bonds, and Coinbase keeps the crypto keys safe. Clear reports and strict rules add another layer of calm. The flagship token, USDY, acts like a stablecoin but also pays yield from the bonds behind it. In the current market, many coins chase hype yet swing wildly. ONDO offers a different story. Its value leans on real income from government bonds, not just code promises. As rates stay high, those bonds pay solid interest, and holders see that flow in tokens. Few other crypto projects can say the same. Rival stablecoins often sit idle, and pure DeFi coins still face hacks and heavy swings. TAO, HBAR, and ONDO look strong in the 2025 surge; however, pioneering all-sport memecoin XYZVerse (XYZ) blends sports passion with meme culture, targets 20,000% upside, and invites early, community-led entry.

Title: Business Technology News: What’s In Microsoft Copilot’s GPT-5 Upgrade?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2025/08/24/business-technology-news-whats-in-microsoft-copilots-gpt-5-upgrade/

ByGene Marks, Contributor. Here are five things in tech that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them? As of August 7, GPT-5 – OpenAI’s most advanced AI model – is now integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Studio worldwide. Microsoft posted the announcement detailing the following capabilities: -Copilot now uses GPT-5’s real-time router to select the best model for each prompt –either a fast-response engine for simple tasks or a deep-reasoning engine for complex ones. -Its human-like capability mirrors how people think producing incisive feedback when tasks require it. -Copilot can review a project, provide a summary of what worked and what didn’t, and draft a “lessons learned” document. -Copilot can handle large documents up to 100K tokens. Microsoft said this update is available for users who have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license – availability to all users will roll out in the coming weeks. (Source: Microsoft) OpenAI has absorbed a fair amount of abuse for its rollout of GPT-5 in the past few weeks thanks to bugs and hallucinations. But the company has taken steps to resolve these issues, and like any new version of a software product, I’m confident the new platform will be more reliable in the coming months. Microsoft is already doubling down by incorporating into its Copilot offerings. If your company is using Copilot – be it for productivity or internal development – you’ll pretty much have no choice but to use the GPT-5 platform going forward. AI is reshaping the workforce often at the expense of employees according to CNBC’s report that compiled responses from management at companies like Amazon, PayPal and Microsoft. AI is being used to streamline operations, boost productivity, and reduce labor costs. AI tools are replacing roles in customer service, HR, finance, and software development, especially entry-level and repetitive jobs. PayPal’s AI assistant – for example – is cutting down on customer service calls and live interactions. Rising unemployment numbers in the tech sector have been voiced by young workers whose skills overlap with AI capabilities. Executives often frame layoffs as “restructuring” or “optimization,” though experts say these are often euphemisms for AI-driven cuts. AI is quietly becoming a powerful force behind workforce reductions, even as companies tout its benefits for efficiency and innovation. (Source: CNBC) Ever see an employee typing pool? Telephone switchboard operators? Gas station attendants? Blacksmiths? Technology has always replaced people. This is nothing new. In 2025 big companies are doing this, mainly by employing AI in customer service and software development. Ultimately this technology will make its way into operations, sales, marketing, accounting and right down on to the shop floor. Small businesses will follow. Labor will be disrupted. The smartest employees will lean into this stuff and use it well. Others will find themselves out of a job. I’m sure there will be other opportunities, just like there’s always been. Angus Loten of the Wall Street Journal reported on the surge in CEO impersonation scams fueled by AI. Last year alone, over 105,000 deepfake attacks were reported with losses exceeding $200 million. Cybercriminals are using AI-generated deepfakes – hyper-realistic video and audio – to impersonate CEOs and other executives. These scams typically begin with a phone call or video meeting from a fake executive making urgent requests for money transfers, sensitive data, or access credentials. The deepfakes are shockingly convincing, mimicking real voices, facial expressions, and body language in real time. Scammers train AI models using publicly available content – interviews, webinars, earnings calls – to replicate executives’ speech and appearance. The targets of these sophisticated scams are often lower-level employees with privileged access. (Source: Wall Street Journal) Another day, another security threat…this time from AI. Deepfakes are getting better at fooling people and will continue to be a rising threat. But there are some old school ways to defend against this. For example, always call the person back. Require multiple sign-offs on any cash transaction. Require additional documentation, even if it’s from the boss. Get training and have some common sense. DocuSign is evolving far beyond e-signatures with its new AI-powered Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform, unveiled in August 2025. With IAM, DocuSign now helps users manage the entire agreement lifecycle – from request intake to execution – using AI and automation. The AI can flag risky or non-compliant terms based on company playbooks; suggest edits to align with internal policies; and centralize templates and audit trails for consistency and visibility. DocuSign Iris is an AI engine that selects the best model for tasks like contract review, compliance checks, and identity verification. This shift turns contracts from static documents into dynamic, searchable data assets, helping businesses reduce errors, accelerate deal cycles, and improve compliance. (Source: Computer Weekly) As a user of DocuSign, I need to take the advice that I often give to others: lean into your software platforms and get training. We’re still using this platform like we did five years ago. And yet, here are a bunch of ways that we could be doing things better if we only spent the time to learn them. I’m in for some more training. PCWorld’s August 2025 guide offers a treasure trove of tech gear to supercharge your work-from-home setup – 42 products in total, all tested and recommended by their editorial team. Their top categories and standout picks: -Webcams: The Anker PowerConf C200 (2K resolution) helps you look sharp on Zoom without breaking the bank. -Laptop stands: Lamicall’s adjustable aluminum stand improves ergonomics and cooling, while Ugreen’s X-Fit doubles as a USB hub. -Audio gear: USB microphones and noise-canceling headphones are essential for clear communication and focus. -Lighting & ambiance: Ring lights, smart bulbs, and desk lamps enhance visibility and mood. -Furniture upgrades: Sit/stand desks and ergonomic chairs support posture and comfort during long hours.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Rather suddenly, there’s been a vibe shift around artificial intelligence, the tech that’s hypnotized Wall Street and inspired cultish devotion across Silicon Valley over the past three years. And while it’s too soon to declare August 2025 the start of the AI winter, or the AI correction, or the AI bubble bursting, or whatever slowdown metaphor you prefer, it is undeniable that a series of industry stumbles is making investors, businesses and customers do a double-take. Among them: All of that has sent traders rushing to buy “disaster puts” — options that act as a kind of insurance for when the market drops — in case we’re about to relive the late-90s dot-com bust. Per Bloomberg, investors aren’t just preparing for a pullback, they’re bracing for a nosedive. “I suspect this will lead to a larger correction,” Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, told me, noting that Meta dangling NFL-like compensation packages to attract AI engineers was “a sign the spending was going over the top.” The tech stocks that have been propping up the entire market, including Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Palantir (PLTR), tumbled this week. (Of course, Wall Street is weighing a lot more than just some bad headlines for the tech sector. There’s also tariffs, mixed retail earnings, and, not least, the president of the United States’ campaign to install loyalists at the Federal Reserve. That central bank drama is piling even more attention after Friday’s speech by Fed Chair Jay Powell, who even in precedented times can move markets with a single furrow of his brow. You’ll be able to hear a pin drop across Wall Street as investors tune in at 10am ET.) For some investors, the tech pullback is “just a pause that may refresh as investors retrench and rethink how they want to position their tech dollars,” Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management Group, told my colleague John Towfighi this week. Maybe. But the ups and downs of the market are just one measure of AI’s impact, and even some of AI’s biggest critics say the downfall won’t happen overnight. “The bubble bursting was never going to be one event, but a series of sentiment shifts against technology that has never proven its worth outside of specious hype,” Ed Zitron, a tech writer and host of the podcast Better Offline, told me. “In any case, it’s been three years, and at some point there had to be some sort of proof that any of this was worth it… The narrative is spiraling out of control, with the only way to fix it being to show actual returns, which none of these companies have.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

After a sweeping rally for U.S. stocks Friday fueled by rising expectations of an interest rate cut next month, earnings from the world's most valuable company and a key measure of inflation could command the spotlight this week. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has been front-and-center in the AI boom, with surging sales on growing demand for the emerging tech. Investors will likely be watching for updates on its most advanced offerings, as well as its plans to navigate changing trade policies, when the company posts its quarterly results. Investors can also look forward to the latest release of the Federal Reserve's favored measure of inflation, which could influence whether the central bank makes its first interest rate cut of the year in September. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Nvidia’s second-quarter results due Wednesday could show whether the chipmaker continues to set the pace in the AI race, with analysts anticipating another sales record despite some headwinds from China export curbs. Nvidia said in May that it expects to report growing revenue, though it warned of a hit from China export restrictions to the tune of $8 billion. The company could offer more updates on its business in China after making a deal with the Trump administration to share revenue from its AI chip sales there. Nvidia is also considering offering a variety of new products for the Chinese market in advance of government approval. Some other companies set to report this week include chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell (DELL), CrowdStrike (CRWD), cloud provider Snowflake (SNOW), and engineering software maker Autodesk (ADSK), along with several Canadian banks. A fresh update on inflation is set to come Friday, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index for July, after dovish remarks last week from Fed Chair Jerome Powell boosted expectations for a rate cut in September. The June PCE report showed that inflation ticked higher that month, but a similar inflation report released earlier showed price increases in July were lower than some feared. The PCE report is the Fed’s preferred measurement of inflation, giving its reading potentially more impact with central bankers ahead of September's interest rate decision. This week will also bring a pair of consumer surveys, data on the U.S. trade balance, and housing market data, among other things. Quick Links: Recap Last Week’s Trading | Read Investopedia’s Latest News Monday, Aug. 25 Tuesday, Aug. 26 Wednesday, Aug. 27 Thursday, Aug. 28 Friday, Aug. 29 A new partnership between CME Group and FanDuel will soon allow for “event contracts” on a wide variety of events, letting users make bets on the outcome of the latest inflation report, cryptocurrency movements, where the S&P 500 finishes, and a host of financial marketplace results.

Title: What Wall Street Analysts Think of Nvidia's Stock Ahead of Earnings Wednesday

Nvidia (NVDA) is set to release its latest quarterly results after the market closes Wednesday, with analysts expecting the most valuable company in the world’s sales could reach another record high, despite an anticipated hit from export curbs. The AI chipmaker is projected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 for the second quarter on an over 50% year-over-year jump in revenue to $46.45 billion, according to consensus estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. CEO Jensen Huang could also provide more details during the company's earnings call about the timing of new products, including Nvidia's next-generation Rubin lineup and a more powerful AI chip tailored for China’s market. In May, Nvidia warned it could face an $8 billion hit from China export restrictions, and although the company recently struck a 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the Trump administration to resume sales of its H20 chip in China, Wednesday’s report will still reflect the full impact of the restrictions. Despite near-term trade policy headwinds, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the chipmaker’s prospects. Of the 14 analysts with current ratings surveyed by Visible Alpha, 13 call the stock a "buy," compared to one "hold" rating. Their targets range from $155 to $225, with the majority above $200, suggesting significant upside from Friday's close around $178. "Expectations have risen ahead of Nvidia's earnings, and we think rightfully so," Morgan Stanley analysts said last week, as they raised their target to $206 from $200, citing strong AI demand signals. UBS also raised its target, to $205 from $175, while Wedbush boosted its to $210 from $175. Shares of Nvidia climbed close to 2% Monday afternoon, and have added over a third of their value in 2025 so far. UPDATE—Aug. 25, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

Title: What I learned about productivity this year
URL: https://www.platformer.news/productivity-tools-ai-2025/
Time Published: 2025-08-24T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
What I gave up, what I kept, and what's new. PLUS: How I'm using AI Once a summer for the past few years, I've taken a break from the news cycle to share a little about how I use technology to do my job. (Here's last year, and the year before.) Readers often tell me they look forward to posts like these, and so in the spirit of giving you more of what you want, here's what I learned about productivity in the past year. Just like last year, I'll offer a couple recommendations for software tools I've recently started using. (None of these recommendations are sponsored, incidentally.) But in an effort to offer a more complete picture of what it's like for me these days to get things done as a journalist and entrepreneur, I also want to talk about what I'm still doing, what I stopped doing, and why. Let's get into it. In my experience, most people use software tools only begrudgingly, and will go to great lengths to avoid ever having to learn a new one. For some percentage of tech enthusiasts, though, trying out new software is a hobby all unto itself. I count myself among this pathological second group, and will regularly drop everything to try out a new to-do app for no productive reason at all. For that reason, I think, the strongest case I can make for you about which software tools are truly useful involve the ones that I have continued to use for more than a year. With that in mind, I'm happy to say I'm still a more-or-less daily user of two apps I told you about last year. Raycast, a launcher app I began using on my Mac, continues to make navigating my laptop effortless. I simply type ⌘-space and can instantly open an app, perform a calculation, reposition my windows, access my clipboard history, look up a word's definition, and dozens of other things. But my favorite use of Raycast is still asking quick questions of AI (a paid upgrade): without ever leaving the tab I'm on, I can look up a quick fact, jog my memory, or get more context. And yes, I double-check any fact it gives me before putting it in the newsletter. But the amount of time and energy I save in context-switching continues to make Raycast a cherished companion. Raycast came to iOS this year, but in truth, I haven't found much use for it. The better news is that it is soon coming to Windows as well; you can sign up for the waitlist here. Capacities, a personal knowledge management app, continues to be my home base for daily planning, journaling, and lightweight task management. The app offers extensive features for folks who like to have dedicated structures and metadata for keeping track of the books they read, the people they meet, and the places they travel. It also has integrated AI chat, integrations with Todoist and other third-party apps, and a growing library of plug-ins built by its community. I've dabbled with those features, but none have stuck. What brings me back to Capacities is the value I find in taking a few minutes most mornings to write in my journal about work, life, and whatever else is on my mind. This clears my head and makes space for me to make a plan for the day, while also letting me noodle on ideas for the column and the podcast. I still do some lightweight tagging of people, topics, and ideas. But I've also come to trust my memory more; it turns out that my mind returning to a subject over and over again is a much more useful signal to me than seeing that I keep tagging the same idea or subject all over again. Or rather, by the time I'm tagging the same idea over and over in Capacities, it has already occurred to me that it's something to write about. And how hard would have it been to find all those stories I so meticulously added and tagged, anyway? Last year I talked about my experiments with Readwise, which I hoped would become a kind of AI librarian. The idea was that it would become a kind of next-generation Pocket, replacing the now-defunct read-it-later app with something more dynamic. It was especially useful at quickly parsing large PDFs, such as court decisions or NGO reports, allowing me to summarize and find relevant parts of the document much faster than I could do myself. It didn't stick. Like Pocket, Readwise turned out to be less of a read-it-later app than a read-it-never app — a place to save articles, books and other media with the best of intentions, and then never to look at it ever again. Summarizing and navigating through PDFs is now something any chatbot will do for you, and for free. Abandoning Readwise is part of an overall move I am making to collecting less stuff. In the past, it seemed obvious that slurping up every item of remote interest into a single database would eventually reap huge rewards for my intellect. And while I continue to investigate new approaches to that question — see below — on the whole I am trying to do less of it. I experimented with Lazy; I spent the past six months keeping a journal of stories about AI in Tana. The best thing I can say about these experiences is that they made it modestly easier to jog my memory about recent events involving a certain company or topic, thanks to the work I had put into tagging them. But doing so required a lot of manual effort, and for only a modest reward. Last month 404 Media's Jason Koebler wrote something that has haunted me ever since: "Where are the journalists who were formerly middling who are now pumping out incredible articles thanks to efficiencies granted by AI?" Koebler's question came as part of a broadside against feckless media executives betting that artificial intelligence will somehow save their businesses despite all current evidence to the contrary. But he also cast doubt on the idea that AI is transformative even at the individual level. I found myself agreeing with him. Like Koebler, I believe that AI is no kind of business model for journalism; and that any efficiencies that individual reporters are seeing from it are relatively modest. There is nothing that AI now does for me that I could not do myself. That said, there are things that AI does for me that I would now hate to do myself, and hope never to do again. There are also some things it can do better than I can, in most cases because it's simply much faster. Here are some of those things: For what it's worth, my most-used models are GPT-5 thinking (previously o3), and Gemini 2.5 Pro. GPT-5 is my daily workhorse, but I also think Gemini is underrated. (Did you know you can upload an audio file to it and it will create a very good transcription for you, and even clean up the filler words?) I find Claude less useful for the tasks above, but I do use it for personal stuff; it has the highest EQ of today's models. (See my ethics disclosure!) And before anyone asks — I do not use AI to draft columns or even to draft outlines. I started a newsletter because I like to write! Two years ago, I wrote this: This feature actually shipped a few months later. My early experiments with it had not gone well. But after interviewing Notion CEO Ivan Zhao for Decoder this month, I gave it another shot. And I'm happy to say that Notion delivered exactly what I was looking for in 2023: the ability to talk to the giant database of links I have stored in it over the past five years, grounded in the actual links and article text I have saved. I can give Notion a sprawling question like "how did the Cambridge Analytica case resolve" and get a good summary of regulatory actions across several years and countries. And by default, web search is off, meaning I know that its AI systems are drawing only on the vetted journalism that I have saved into my database. This is a dream come true. I finally have a meaningful way to sift through millions of words of article text, ask follow-up questions, and get citations that I can use in my work. Notion may yet prove to be the AI librarian that Readwise never became. One more thing I'm trying: I mentioned above that I continue to experiment with different ways to save material that might be useful later. Recently a Reddit post turned me on to Recall, which positions itself as a "self-organizing knowledge base." Currently available as a web and mobile app, Recall lets you save web pages, YouTube videos, PDFs, podcasts, Google Docs, and other materials into a single database that it then organizes on your behalf. Recall is largely redundant to Notion. But I love its interface, its speed, and its overall user experience. Lately, the CEOs I cover have all started doing two- to three-hour podcast recordings. With Recall, I can save the podcast with one click, have it instantly generate a summarized transcript with timestamps, and let the app automatically connect it to other relevant articles and podcasts in my database. It performs similarly well with PDFs of books, which I rarely have the time to read in their entirety, but can now skim using Recall's detailed summaries and decide whether I want to dig in deeper. Recall aims itself in part at students — it will also generate quizzes for you based on the material you save. And like basically every other productivity app today, it also has integrated AI chat, so you can ask questions about long documents and get grounded answers. I haven't been using Recall for long, but for the moment it is scratching my web-hoarding itch unlike anything else has quite been able to do to date. If I've learned one bitter lesson about this stuff over the years, it's that the best productivity hack in the world is simply liking your job. If you enjoy what you do, you will find ways to do it, and in 2025 almost any software remotely suited to the purpose will be more than good enough. On a fundamental level, every single to-do list app is exactly the same. But it's fun to try new things. And while I continue to waste countless hours and a fair bit of money doing so, I also feel like this pursuit keeps me connected to the state of the art. The Notion workspace I dreamed of two years ago is now here at my fingertips. The looming question, as ever, is what I will do with it. On the podcast this week: Kevin and I explore what it means that we're in an AI bubble. Then, Reuters' Jeff Horwitz stops by to discuss his blockbuster story about Meta's policy to let its chatbot engage in "sensual" roleplay with children. And finally, I introduce Kevin to the wild world of "shock slop" — AI-generated songs meant to freak out your parents.

Title: Cracker Barrel’s marketing fiasco shows investors are making woke a massive risk factor

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/23/2025 7:00:15 PM PDT by MinorityRepublican If the Cracker Barrel market puke has anything to teach Wall Street, it’s that investors who are deciding where to put their money must add corporate “wokeness” to their menu of risks to ­digest. In fact, making “woke” an investing risk factor — in some cases as important as the direction of interest rates and inflation — seems so obvious that I hesitated to write this column. Recall Bud Light’s ­Dylan Mulvaney fiasco, or Target CEO Brian Cornell’s recent exit following his ill-fated ­obsession with DEI. Wokeness is generally defined as subjecting the culture and business to left-wing dogma involving race, sex and viewing all things Americana as anathema. It simply doesn’t sell to mass audiences. And yet companies keep going there. Corporate managers, it turns out, are a politically and socially tone-deaf bunch. They are lousy at reading the current mood of the country and its hatred of progressive indoctrination — whether in the classroom or when they simply want to enjoy a beer. Their advisers may be even worse. That’s why shareholders must demand — whether it’s at annual meetings, on earnings calls or with testy phone calls to Investor Relations — that the C-suite extricate wokeness from corporate decision-making. While it’s not mainstream, there are some savvy Wall Street types adding “woke risk” to their models, just not using that exact terminology. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Either way the leftist ghouls win, by turning turning your favorite wholesome company into a leftist perversion factory, or by pushing you to destroy it yourself in anger. I’m convinced that was the conscious plan with Disney. Plan A was to twist and pervert everything it previously stood for, actually turning it into a vehicle for perverting young children, but if enough people rose up and pushed back Plan B was to ignore them and keep pushing the garbage they hated so they they themselves would eventually destroy the company. Their highest priority was to pervert good, wholesome companies, thereby denying normal Americans what they had previously enjoyed, but they are equally happy to just tick off those people to the point that THEY destroy the company, similarly denying themselves access to what that company was before.

Recall Bud Light’s ­Dylan Mulvaney fiasco, or Target CEO Brian Cornell’s recent exit following his ill-fated ­obsession with DEI. Wokeness is generally defined as subjecting the culture and business to left-wing dogma involving race, sex and viewing all things Americana as anathema. It simply doesn’t sell to mass audiences. And yet companies keep going there. Corporate managers, it turns out, are a politically and socially tone-deaf bunch. They are lousy at reading the current mood of the country and its hatred of progressive indoctrination — whether in the classroom or when they simply want to enjoy a beer. Their advisers may be even worse. That’s why shareholders must demand — whether it’s at annual meetings, on earnings calls or with testy phone calls to Investor Relations — that the C-suite extricate wokeness from corporate decision-making. While it’s not mainstream, there are some savvy Wall Street types adding “woke risk” to their models, just not using that exact terminology. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Either way the leftist ghouls win, by turning turning your favorite wholesome company into a leftist perversion factory, or by pushing you to destroy it yourself in anger. I’m convinced that was the conscious plan with Disney. Plan A was to twist and pervert everything it previously stood for, actually turning it into a vehicle for perverting young children, but if enough people rose up and pushed back Plan B was to ignore them and keep pushing the garbage they hated so they they themselves would eventually destroy the company.

Title: The High Cost Of Ditching DEI: What Target’s Boycott Fallout Reveals
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/08/23/the-high-cost-of-ditching-dei-what-targets-boycott-fallout-reveals/
Time Published: 2025-08-24T01:43:00Z
Full Content:
ByJanice Gassam Asare, Ph.D., Senior Contributor. It was recently announced that Target’s CEO of 11 years, Brian Cornell, would be stepping down and Michael Fiddelke, 20-year Target veteran and the Chief Operating Officer, would be stepping in to replace him. Target’s stock has seen a considerable decline since the start of 2025. While some have attributed the company’s decline to Trump’s tariffs and the weakening economy, the company’s about-face when it came to DEI sparked backlash and criticism, leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many consumers. In February of 2025, prominent Atlanta pastor Dr. Jamal Bryant called for a boycott of Target in response to the company’s rollback of their DEI initiatives. The boycott, Bryant indicated, has been the most successful Black boycott since the Montgomery Bus Boycott that occurred 70 years ago. DEI is currently the nation’s favorite bogeyman; being blamed for everything from bridge collapses to plane crashes. There is still a lack of understanding regarding what DEI is, how it can positively impact employees and how it can benefit workplaces, contributing to some of the DEI pushback that has increased in recent months. Make no mistake; DEI is far from perfect, but the existence of workplace DEI programs often provides a pathway to address harm that takes place in the workplace. Many Black consumers saw Target’s decision to cut DEI initiatives as a slap in the face. The company was seemingly so outspoken with their support of Black businesses, pledging a $2 billion investment in Black-owned businesses after the murder of George Floyd. Consumers have become much more judicious with their spending, deciding to resist through their wallets. Costco has been an outspoken advocate of DEI, choosing not to flounder under pressure from DEI opponents, and has seen a net increase in sales, which many attribute to their doubling down of DEI. Target drew the public’s ire because unlike many of the companies that announced they were scaling back their DEI efforts in the past year, Target was one of the most ardent supporters of DEI through their racial equity agenda. With Target being headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company was at ground zero following the tragic murder of George Floyd. The expectation was that their proximity to the tragedy would result in a true commitment to uplift the Black community, but less than five years later, the company reneged on their promises and pledges. In 1969, activist Fred Hampton was instrumental in spearheading the Rainbow Coalition, where different groups of people worked together to address a common issue. What made the coalition so successful is the power in numbers—multiple people working towards a shared goal is an effective way to combat societal ills. During the Montgomery Bus Boycotts, Black folks were able to inspire and mobilize people from outside the Black community to join their cause. What has made the Target boycott so successful has been a similar strategy from the boycott organizers. It hasn’t been only Black consumers who have been boycotting Target. Communities of other historically marginalized and excluded populations (Latinos, poor folks, the LGBTQIA+ community) have also mobilized to support the boycott. Different groups who knew that DEI rollbacks would impact their communities have come together after calls to boycott from leaders like Bryant. There is power in numbers but it’s important to note: when there is a critical mass of people working towards a shared goal, that goal can be accomplished, according to Harvard political scientist Erica Chenoweth. Chenoweth’s research indicated that only 3.5% of a population’s participation is needed to drive change. The question remains whether the hiring of a new CEO will resurrect Target’s image and thus their sales. In a recent CNN interview, Bryant noted that hiring an internal candidate who has been at the company for decades will not change the company’s engrained ideology or their stance on DEI. Contrary to the popular saying, companies that “go woke,” perhaps won’t actually go broke. Companies should learn from Target’s missteps; a commitment to ensuring that all employees are treated equitably and fairly is not a nice-to-have but a need-to-have. Both consumers and employees are watching; if your words don’t align with your actions, there will be a price to pay. Rather than swaying to appease investors, the DEI detractors, or this current administration, the longevity and sustainability of companies will ultimately be decided by how they treat their employees. People are not settling for crumbs—a failure to prioritize the wellbeing of workers will continue to have dire consequences.

Title: Judge Allows Claim That Large Investors Conspired To Drive Up Coal, Energy Costs

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/23/2025 4:20:09 PM PDT by CFW Wyoming and 10 other states’ claims that giant investment companies conspired to drive coal production down and drive prices up — increasing people’s energy costs — are at least plausible enough to keep a lawsuit alive, a judge has ruled. Wyoming filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas in late November against Blackrock Inc., State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton led the litigation. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming also signed the complaint. The states allege the three massive investment companies acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the U.S., then agreed to use their holdings to influence those companies and artificially depress the output of coal. “Defendants allegedly did so in the name of ‘environmental stewardship’ and ‘concern for the climate,’” recounted U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy D. Kernodle in an Aug. 1 order. “The result, Plaintiffs assert, is that ‘Defendants have reaped the rewards of higher returns, higher fees, and higher profits, while American consumers have paid the price in higher utility bills and higher costs.’” (Excerpt) Read more at cowboystatedaily.com ...

Posted on 08/23/2025 4:20:09 PM PDT by CFW Wyoming and 10 other states’ claims that giant investment companies conspired to drive coal production down and drive prices up — increasing people’s energy costs — are at least plausible enough to keep a lawsuit alive, a judge has ruled. Wyoming filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas in late November against Blackrock Inc., State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton led the litigation. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming also signed the complaint. The states allege the three massive investment companies acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the U.S., then agreed to use their holdings to influence those companies and artificially depress the output of coal. “Defendants allegedly did so in the name of ‘environmental stewardship’ and ‘concern for the climate,’” recounted U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy D.

Title: BlackRock ETH $254M move and the Pepeto versus Little Pepe choice for the best crypto token

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Will Bitcoin and Ethereum lead the next wave, or make room for new names? Bitcoin is quiet as large holders buy and keep, so it acts like a safe asset today. On August 21, 2025, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETFs recorded $254M exit, yet many experts still see strength in ETH. Arthur Hayes says ETH could reach $10K to $20K, and charts point to a level near $5,500. Even so, many traders now see only about two times left in BTC and ETH, so focus shifts to presale memecoins with tiny prices and larger upside. Is that where the big money will go next? One new token stays on the Ethereum mainnet and aims to solve real problems. It has already raised millions and includes live tools, a zero-fee DEX, a cross-chain bridge, and staking at a rate of nearly 240 percent. Another new meme coin takes the Layer 2 route that many teams choose. It offers speed, but it adds steps and bridge risk that can drain trust and flow. Whales who once backed Pepe and Shiba now choose between these two as the best memecoin. So, what do they offer, and which one is the smarter choice in 2025? Pepeto, PEPETO, is an Ethereum memecoin in presale at $0.000000148, with over $6M raised and more than 100,000 community members. A demo exchange is live, and audits by SolidProof and Coinsult are complete. Built on the Ethereum mainnet, it blends meme culture with working tools, a zero-fee DEX, a native cross-chain bridge, and staking at a near 240% APY. This mix of trust and utility makes Pepeto one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Little Pepe, in contrast, sits on a Layer 2 network, which adds friction, thinner liquidity, and higher bridge risk. Its presale spreads many tokens, but without strong audits or live tools, it remains basic, and its Layer 2 base looks weak next to Pepeto’s mainnet build. Pepeto, PEPETO, is built on the Ethereum mainnet, a tougher route but the one with better upside. It tackles two major issues: high fees and thin liquidity. PepetoSwap offers zero-fee trading, allowing users to keep more of their funds, and every swap utilizes Pepeto tokens. That creates steady demand, similar to how BNB supports Binance’s long-term growth. The Pepeto Bridge moves tokens across chains inside one app. For early buyers, this mix can turn first entries into millionaire results as use expands toward one hundred times or more. Little Pepe uses a Layer 2. It is not much faster, and it adds steps, more bridge risk, and less trust. Beyond a presale, it brings little, and it looks weak next to Pepeto’s tools and mainnet build; it cannot deliver beyond five times. Pepeto is set for life-changing gains. After launch, achieving fifty times is feasible, and with a Tier 1 listing like Binance, one hundred times becomes realistic. As more tokens join PepetoSwap, demand can climb again, making $200,000 a clear target. Also, thirty percent of the supply is allocated for staking, offering rewards of nearly 244 percent APY, which supports the price as more buyers arrive. Little Pepe may jump five times after launch from presale buzz, but coins like this often fall quickly. Without tools, mainnet strength, or deep liquidity, its Layer 2 base can see price drops in days. That is where Pepeto stands apart; staking and real products keep it alive, while weak, hype-only coins like Little Pepe fade. Bitcoin and Ethereum may be steady now, but many analysts say the most they can deliver from here is about two times, and even that could be hard. Side by side, Pepeto versus Little Pepe makes the choice clear. Pepeto operates on the Ethereum mainnet, utilizing real tools, a demo exchange, zero-fee swaps on PepetoSwap, a native bridge, and robust staking. In contrast, Little Pepe relies on a thin Layer 2 with minimal real value. This is why smart whales are moving into Pepeto. They were early to Shiba and Pepe before the big runs, and they know when a true opportunity appears. For them, Pepeto is the name that can change the life of every early buyer, so the time to step in is now.

Title: Exposed: Cracker Barrel workers' bombshell claims about $1M-a-year CEO as she faces calls to quit over 'delusional' woke rebrand

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/23/2025 1:41:28 PM PDT by libh8er The embattled CEO of Cracker Barrel has been accused by workers of slashing working hours and reducing food quality, Daily Mail can exclusively reveal, as she faces calls for her resignation over a disastrous rebrand. The chain debuted a new logo for the first time in 48 years earlier this week, sparking outrage among customers and wiping millions off the company stock price, which shed almost $100 million in market value on Thursday. President and CEO Julie Masino, who earns $1 million a year, has become a target for those outraged over the change. Staff have vented over what they describe as poor management at the highest level of the company by airing their grievances on the employment review site Glass Door. A crew member in Minnesota posted: 'To the CEO Julie Masino, stop cutting our hours. 'We are making less pay for more work when we are understaffed because you suck at bringing this dead company from its grave. 'Stop lowering your food quality. No it is NOT a good idea to force your cooks to serve bacon that is over a day old. Bacon shouldn't be saved overnight, believe it or not.' One worker, who claims they are an Associate Manager at a branch in South Carolina, posted: 'New leadership is driving the company down. 'There is now nothing that makes Cracker Barrel any different from every other below-average restaurant chain.' A general manager at a restaurant in Maumee, Ohio, added: 'Poor management and untraditional employee relations all the way up to the corporate level.' Daily Mail has approached the company for comment on the allegations made by the employees. The new, simplified logo features just the text of the brand name in a rounded-off yellow hexagon after the firm ditched its legendary mascot Uncle Herschel.

Title: Spot XRP ETFs Likely Coming Soon? Seven Asset Managers File Amended S-1 Applications
URL: https://zycrypto.com/spot-xrp-etfs-likely-coming-soon-seven-asset-managers-file-amended-s-1-applications/
Time Published: 2025-08-23T19:51:05Z
Full Content:
Seven asset managers, including Grayscale, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, and WisdomTree, all filed revised statements for their proposed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Friday. The simultaneous filings represent a coordinated wave of activity as would-be issuers are eager to secure approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While the SEC has already approved futures-based ETFs, the agency has yet to greenlight a spot XRP fund. According to experts, Friday’s round of filings could signal that asset managers are responding to feedback from the regulatory agency. “[The filings were] almost certainly due to feedback from SEC,” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart observed in a post on X. “Good sign, but also mostly expected.” In the amended filings, issuers seek to alter the structure of some of the funds to allow for XRP or cash creations and cash or in-kind redemptions, rather than simply cash creations and redemptions. Similarly, NovaDius Wealth president Nate Geraci shared a similar sentiment, noting that it is remarkable to see the various asset managers roll out their amended S-1 filings on the same day. “Very good sign IMO.” Geraci opined. While the filings do not guarantee imminent approval, they indicate active dialogue between issuers and the Securities and Exchange Commission during the review process. Meanwhile, BlackRock, the asset manager managing the world’s largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, has yet to submit paperwork for an XRP ETF. BlackRock clarified earlier this month that it does not have any current plans to introduce an XRP-based ETF despite the long-standing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC wrapping up. Nevertheless, Bloomberg’s exchange-traded fund specialists Eric Balchunas and Seyffart project a 95% possibility of XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs being approved by the US SEC before the end of 2025. At the time of writing this, XRP was trading at $3.02. The cross-border payments token could skyrocket significantly higher as positive fundamentals like the resolution of the SEC vs. Ripple case and rising odds of an XRP ETF approval could potentially embolden the bulls.

Title: ‘It’s Not Going to Slow Down’: The Tech Stock Everyone Is Watching This Week
URL: https://gizmodo.com/nvidia-earnings-tech-drop-2000647269
Time Published: 2025-08-23T18:59:34Z

Wall Street is narrowing in on must-watch tech giant Nvidia (NVDA) this week, as the $4 trillion semiconductor company reports earnings amid an ongoing skid in the technology sector. “When the group goes down and the most important stock in the group reports earnings, that is going to have a bigger impact than usual,” Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, told Reuters. That impact has analysts rushing to change their projections for the release of Nvidia’s quarterly report on Wednesday, with multiple influential predictions now adjusted to show a higher price target of $194 per share for that 12-month period, the highest amount for which the shares have ever traded. The stock closed up more than 3% at the end of trading Friday at $177.99 amid a broader market rally led by other tech and finance companies. We covered the crypto companies that pushed that surge earlier today. “What youâre seeing is the recognition that growth at Nvidia is rock solid,” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told Bloomberg. “Analysts are raising projections because they simply need to, the stock is not going to slow down.” It’s been quite a year for Nvidia. The stock has been caught in the Trump administration’s tariff wars and fell sharply in April. It has since clawed back about three-quarters of those losses. But that dip followed a chilly beginning to 2025, as it became clear that even Nvidia would have tough competition from compatriot company DeepSeek, which rolled out a discount AI model that astonished the market. Recently, the stock wobbled this week as the broader AI market felt the effects of being dubbed a “bubble” by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. More immediately, Nvidia has signaled it is willing to play ball with Trump’s aggressive attempts to take stakes in major tech companies like Apple and AMD. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is in talks with the American government to produce a new computer chip, a move that coincides with a joint announcement that the U.S. will take a 10% ownership slice of Intel. âIâm offering a new product to China for … AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,â Huang said. But he added that âThatâs not our decision to make. Itâs up to, of course, the United States government. And weâre in dialogue with them, but itâs too soon to know.â In the wake of Altman’s comments, however, Nvidia’s share price fell to $174 from $182 in 48 hours, as proponents of the AI bubble theory came out in force. Still, no matter how much external pressure Nvidia feels from competitors and a rapidly evolving landscape of technology, it still remains the dominant player because of its sheer size and faster moves out of the starting blocks with its AI. It also has far more reach and potentially a wider variety of clients for its more diversified set of products. “[Nvidia] commentary on the demand side… should be more bullish just because their largest customers have all kind of upped their capex guidance over the last few quarters,” Roach told Reuters. In fact, it is so big and has grown at such a scorching pace that if its quarterly revenue is up less than 70% year over year when it reports Wednesday, the company would likely see its share price fall. A growth in revenue at that rate would be a major coup for most other companies, 24/7 Wall Street points outâfor Nvidia, however, it would alarm investors who are spooked by the idea that it may eventually even slow down.

Under President Trump, the U.S. government is increasingly intervening in corporate America, taking equity stakes in companies like U.S. Steel, MP Materials, and Intel. This shift, driven by national security concerns, resembles state-managed capitalism, worrying Wall Street. Companies are scrambling to adapt, fearing demands and potential disadvantages if they don't align with the administration.

Title: 'The dumbest thing I've ever heard': Amazon Web Services CEO lambasts replacing junior employees with AI, but he still loves AI

AWS CEO Matt Garman spoke up for entry-level jobs, but still insists AI will change all jobs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. In an interview with investor and AI evangelist Matthew Berman this week, AWS CEO Matt Garman shut down the idea that junior employees should be replaced by AI, calling it "the dumbest thing I've ever heard." "They're probably the least expensive employees you have, they're the most leaned in to your AI tools, and how's that going to work when you go, like, 10 years in the future and you have no one that has built up or learned anything? "My view is like, you absolutely want to keep hiring kids out of college and teaching them the right ways to go build software and decompose problems and think about it." But overall, Garman still has the optimistic take on AI's impact on the job market you commonly see from tech executives. "I think AI has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company, and every single job," Garman said. "But it doesn't mean they go away. It has transformed them, not replaced them." He added that, "I'm not minimizing that uncertainty that people will have and I know people are worried about [AI] and I think one of the things is, embrace that technology. The more you can embrace that technology, be flexible, understand how it can help you do your job faster and better, [then] I think the better off people are going to be as they make that transition." It's somewhat refreshing to hear a tech CEO defend entry-level jobs, especially with some estimates showing some 50% of all entry-level office jobs could be eliminated by AI in the coming years. Unfortunately, these comments come just a month after hundreds of Amazon Web Services employees were laid off. Amazon explained the layoffs in a statement to Reuters, commenting: "These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers." While that statement doesn't mention AI, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy made comments back in June that seemed to hint that AI will be responsible for job elimination. Jassy said in an employee memo, "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company."

Title: Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund makes bold $200 million investment in Bitcoin and Ethereum

Time Published: 2025-08-23T16:43:00Z
Full Content:
FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, has invested $200 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The investment was split evenly between the two cryptocurrencies. This marks a significant move by institutional players re-entering the digital assets market. https://twitter.com/binance/status/1957985943966892063 Founders Fund began purchasing Bitcoin in 2014 but had liquidated its holdings before the market crash in 2022. The firm initially bought Bitcoin when it was valued below $30,000. With the current price at $50,000, this investment has yielded an unrealized profit of about 66%. https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1958745372978827422 Joey Krug, former co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, joined Founders Fund as a partner in April 2023. The firm has previously invested in Paxos, the NFT platform Royal, and the decentralized autonomous organization BitDAO. Thiel, a long-time proponent of digital assets, stated back in 2017 that people underestimate Bitcoin’s potential. https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1958187196609163377 In October 2020, the billionaire expressed regret over insufficient investments in the leading cryptocurrency. Venture capitalists are benefiting from an ether rally this year. Proponents see Ethereum becoming the platform of choice for the financial world. https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1957840067474416095 Ether, the cryptocurrency long overshadowed by bitcoin, has surged about 13.5% this month. Investment firms own 7.5% of ETHZilla, which recently transformed itself from a biotech company to focus on selling shares to buy ether. Its stock tripled in value in one day last week after investment disclosures, though it has since fallen some. Investment firms also control 9.1% of Bitmine Immersion Technologies, which has seen its value surge more than 1,000% since late June. The company now has a market value of $8.3 billion. Recent bets stem from a belief that the Ethereum network will keep growing. Bulls also hope Ethereum will become a popular platform for launching new financial products. Tokenized money-market funds from BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already operate on the Ethereum network, as does the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund. Activity on Ethereum amounted to more than $1.2 trillion this year, compared with $960 billion during the same time frame last year, according to data from The Block. Betting on ether remains risky. It isn’t clear that Ethereum will become widely used in finance. Some activity on the network appears to be spam-related, including nefarious phishing attacks. Nonetheless, the Trump administration’s embrace of cryptocurrencies adds momentum. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that stablecoins, many of which are traded on Ethereum, could play a role in reining in the national debt by driving demand for U.S. Treasurys. In August 2025, billionaire investor Peter Thiel made a seismic move in the crypto landscape by acquiring a 7.5% stake in ETHZilla, a company aggressively accumulating Ethereum. Through his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, Thiel now holds 11.6 million shares of ETHZilla, which has committed to an aggressive accumulation strategy. Thiel’s investment in ETHZilla is part of a calculated strategy to position Ethereum as a “productive asset” rather than a purely speculative one. ETHZilla has raised $425 million through private placements and $156 million via convertible notes, using the funds to acquire 82,186 ETH (worth $349 million at the time of purchase). The institutional adoption of Ethereum is accelerating as companies treat ETH as a strategic balance sheet asset. Over 1.74 million ETH—valued at $6.5 billion—is now held by publicly traded firms like Coinbase and Bit Digital. These entities are not merely accumulating ETH but are deploying it on-chain to generate returns. Ethereum’s yield advantage is significant when compared to traditional fixed-income instruments. While U.S. Treasury bonds offer 4.5% and corporate bonds 5–7%, Ethereum’s staking yield is bolstered by its potential for price appreciation. While Ethereum’s institutional adoption is robust, risks remain. Validator slashing (up to 10% loss of staked ETH) and liquidity constraints due to Ethereum’s withdrawal queue are operational challenges. However, these are mitigated by Ethereum’s energy-efficient PoS model and regulatory clarity. For investors, Ethereum’s institutional adoption presents a clear opportunity. The ETH/BTC price ratio has broken above its 365-day moving average, signaling institutional preference for Ethereum. Analysts project ETH to reach $7,709 by 2026, driven by corporate treasury accumulation and ETF inflows. As companies like ETHZilla, BitMine, and SharpLink Gaming demonstrate, Ethereum’s yield-generating capabilities and programmable infrastructure make it a superior treasury asset. For investors, this signals the dawn of a new bull market—one driven by institutional confidence in Ethereum’s utility and long-term value.

Title: NSE, Tata Capital, SBI AMC, Lenskart, Pine Labs, HDFC Securities: Are unlisted shares a trap or opportunity for investors?

Prices circulate like hot tips. “NSE trades near ₹2,000 in the unlisted market, up 80 per cent in a year,” says one post. Another forwards a pitch on Tata Capital, citing Tata Technologies’ 2023 debut, where the shares priced ₹500 in the IPO closed at ₹1,313 on debut. Such chatter highlights the new obsession: unlisted shares, or pre-IPO stocks. Sellers include employees monetising ESOPs, VC (venture capital)/PE (private equity) funds and AIF (alternative investment funds)/PMS (portfolio management services) strategies trimming stakes, promoters seeking liquidity, and brokers sourcing blocks. Buyers once limited to wealthy individuals, HNIs and insiders now include semi-mainstream investors, where unlisted stocks are pushing to become an integral part of the portfolio. The IPO euphoria adds fuel. In FY25, 78 main-board public issues raised a record ₹1.62 lakh crore, 2.5x the previous year, according to primedatabase. Yet, allotments remain elusive: 56 issues drew bids over 10x, with 33 of them above 50x. With such odds, many investors are turning to the invisible — unlisted market. The pitch is simple: buy early, ride the buzz and cash out at listing. And this is no small pool. As Motilal Oswal Financial Services Chairman Raamdeo Agarawal noted in the latest annual report, 1,300 unlisted firms earned ₹100 crore-plus profits in FY24, together raking in ₹7.5 lakh crore. At 20x multiple, this equals about ₹150 lakh crore of potential IPO market-cap. Still, for all the promise, the unlisted space is a grey zone. Markets are loosely regulated, prices swing wildly, liquidity can be shallow, information patchy and exits tricky. Yet the excitement around names such as SBI AMC, Lenskart, Acko, BOAT, Pine Labs, Rapido, HDFC Securities and Hero FinCorp shows why the buzz is growing louder every week. In other words, the market may be niche compared with India’s ₹450 lakh crore listed universe, but it is alive with promise, speculation and no shortage of risk. In 2022, a purportedly leaked audio of a furious founder berating a banker over missed IPO shares showed how emotions run high when allocations slip away. A quick scan of IPO forums, X posts or comments in Instagram reels shows retail investors echoing the same anger. Some blame IPO registrars, others mock the lottery system. With huge IPO oversubscriptions, the odds are stacked against small investors hoping to make a quick buck on listing pop. This frustration is pushing many to the unlisted space. The logic is simple: If the public issue is inaccessible, try to buy earlier in the private market, even at a premium. What was once a closed, opaque dealer-driven activity has broadened in recent years. Digital platforms and wealth managers now act as intermediaries, matching buyers and sellers. Firms such as WWIPL, Unlistedzone, InCredMoney, Stockify, Sharescart and Planify publish price quotes and updates that were earlier unavailable. Entry thresholds have also been lowered. Another driver is employee stock sales. Start-up staff often monetise ESOPs in unlisted markets, creating steady supply. On the demand side, investors view this as early access to future giants. India has over 110 unicorns worth over $350 billion as per studies. Some, like Flipkart and Physicswallah, already trade in the private market. But risks are evident: Several celebrated start-ups have faced valuation markdowns of 50-70 per cent in recent rounds. In 2024, BlackRock marked down its BYJU’s stake, once worth $22 billion, to zero! PharmEasy’s parent, API Holdings, has also seen valuations collapse from nearly $4 billion in 2021 to a fraction today. There is also the pull of exclusivity. Investors like owning what others cannot. Screenshots of holdings in buzzy companies circulate on WhatsApp groups as a badge of early access. With prices shooting up, early investors in unlisted firms become advertisers, boasting of paper gains. For instance, unlisted SBI AMC in the past two years delivered about 64 per cent CAGR, according to data from unlisted trading platform WWIPL. This compares to 52 per cent CAGR by listed peer HDFC AMC in the same period. Stories of celebrities making 50-100x on pre-IPO bets also catch eyeballs. Since such shares are scarce, artificial scarcity itself adds to premiums. It is true that the private market generates more return. For instance, Primex 40 is up 20 per cent in the last one year, 94 per cent in the last two years and 215 per cent in the last five years. These returns are much higher than Sensex across periods. The Primex 40 index tracks India’s top private firms, weighted by market cap; current top constituents include NSE, SBI AMC, Tata Capital, Capgemini Technology Services India, Nayara Energy, CIAL, GFCL EV, Hero Fincorp, HDFC Securities and Incred Holdings. But this early opportunity space carries risks just as significant. Unlike listed equities, no centralised exchange exists for price discovery. Quotes vary across dealers and platforms, with opaque spreads as intermediaries price differently. Some merely arrange transfers between large sellers and small buyers, leaving loyalties unclear. Prices of buzzy counters can swing within days, with spikes often fuelled purely by demand-supply dynamics than fundamentals. And when unlisted stocks go out of favour, liquidity drops to nil within days. Listed shares can be exited in seconds; unlisted ones can stay stuck for weeks. Even big names can face long dry spells after negative news; for smaller firms, illiquidity can be total. Exits can become even harder if a company delays its IPO (for example, OYO trying to go public since 2019) or faces valuation markdowns (Mobikwik’s IPO valuation was over 50 per cent lower than last funding valuation pre-IPO in 2021). Lately, IPOs such as HDB Financial, Vikram Solar and NSDL priced 15-40 per cent below unlisted market expectations, according to reports. The risk-return record of pre-IPO bets underscores the challenge. According to a Client Associates white paper, only nine out of 21 new-age companies that went public between May 2020 and June 2025 generated positive alpha over their pre-IPO price. For every Zomato, Policybazaar, Ixigo or Ather Energy that rewarded early buyers, there were disappointments such as Paytm, Ola Electric, FirstCry and Mobikwik. The distribution is highly polarised, some delivered exceptional gains, but many destroyed capital. Beyond pricing, liquidity, delays in listing, corporate governance and founder behaviour can also impact investors. Instances have been reported where some start-up founders create new entities, leaving old investors stuck and their value eroded. For investors in young companies, the risk is amplified. Even larger, older firms are not immune to shocks if management changes course or policy/regulations become unfavourable. Take Dream11, for instance. Its unlisted shares were available on some platforms, and earlier this year the Burgundy Private Hurun India 500 report ranked it the eighth most valuable unlisted company in India. But fortunes can turn fast. On August 21, 2025, the Parliament passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill within 72 hours of Cabinet clearance, banning real money games. The law will prohibit firms like Dream11 from accepting user deposits for games where players risk losing money. Information asymmetry is a major challenge. Listed firms provide quarterly disclosures, analyst calls and continuous updates. Unlisted companies, governed by the Companies Act, file audited accounts just once a year, often delayed. Public documents are few, and MCA21 access is cumbersome. MCA21 is the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ online portal for company information. It provides public access to filings, records and financials of even unlisted firms. But there’s no dependable way to gauge unlisted firms’ business momentum or financial health regularly. Ordinary investors may unknowingly fund exits for insiders with superior knowledge. With such limited disclosures, this asymmetry puts retail investors at a clear disadvantage.Rating agency actions are published at wide intervals, only if the firm is rated. There is also hardly any reliable analyst coverage in unlisted stocks, who can provide neutral opinion on valuation. Together, these factors i.e. uncertain pricing and listing timelines, poor liquidity,, governance risks, and patchy disclosures make unlisted shares a very high-risk space. Investors attracted by the potential upside must weigh these challenges carefully. SEBI Chairman Tuhin Kanta last week said that SEBI may pilot a regulated pre-IPO platform with required disclosures before listing. This may help address many of the pain-points. Till then, investors must take cognisance of the challenges. Yet while unlisted stocks are risky, for some the charm may be worth it as there are success stories also. Time and again, SEBI has cautioned investors against using unauthorised online platforms for trading unlisted public company securities. Hence those with skills to assess the risk-reward clearly, must stick to regulated brokers and platforms only. Earlier dealer-driven, trades now happen via brokers, digital platforms and wealth desks that publish quotes and basic data. In a typical flow (off-market DP to DP (depository participant) transfer), buyer receives an indicative two-way quote and confirms quantity and price. Note, quotes are non-binding and can change quickly. Buyer shares PAN, Aadhaar, Client Master List (CML) from their DP, a cancelled cheque and sometimes a DIS/e-DIS (electronic delivery instruction slip) consent. Address proof and selfie/video-KYC are common. Intermediary verifies ISIN (International Securities Identification Number), free holdings, pledge/lien status and whether the company’s Articles require ROFR (right of first refusal)/board consent. Some issuers may insist on pre-approval before transfer. Payment is usually NEFT/RTGS/IMPS to an escrow or mapped account (no cash). Many follow Delivery-vs-Payment (DVP) so that funds are released after demat credit. Others use T+1/T+3 settlement. Seller raises an off-market instruction with their DP (NSDL/CDSL). Buyer receives credit in the demat. In terms of timelines, same-day to T+3 is common. Delays could arise from KYC mismatches, bank cut-offs, DP holidays, or issuer approvals. Large counters need high minimums, though some intermediaries allow smaller tickets (₹50,000-1 lakh). In terms of capital gain taxes, short-term capital gains or STCG (≤24 months) is taxed at slab for unlisted shares and long-term capital gains or LTCG (>24 months) at 12.5 per cent without indexation. If sold post-listing, Securities Transaction Tax (STT) applies; >one year qualifies for equity LTCG. Pre-IPO shares carry a six-month lock-in. One of the major operational risks to watch is the lack of exchange arbitration. So, dispute redressal is weaker than in listed markets. Also, watch out for fraudsters and scamsters. Practical safeguards include using DVP/escrow system, if possible. Try to avoid pay-first arrangements unless you trust the intermediary. Insist on invoice/contract note and transfer proof. Verify ISIN, share class and any transfer restrictions before wiring funds. Keep all KYC and DP details exact; even minor mismatches can stall transfers. NSDL’s June 3 circular reportedly mandates prior written consent from unlisted companies for off-market share transfers. Consent must be signed by an authorised official and include transferor/transferee details, PANs, share class and compliance with Articles of Association and Companies Act. In this case, timelines could be much longer than T+3. Published on August 23, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

According to the latest report, a group of asset management firms submitted S-1 amendments for a spot XRP ETF (exchange-traded fund) in the United States. These movements reflect the ramped-up interest of these institutions to get the approval of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer this crypto-linked investment product. On Friday, August 22, a slew of asset managers, including Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and WisdomTree, filed amended S-1 statements for their proposed spot XRP ETFs. According to experts, this round of filings might be in response to the US SEC’s feedback on their original applications. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X: Bunch of XRP ETF filings being updated by issuers today. Almost certainly due to feedback from [the] SEC. Good sign, but also mostly expected. Similarly, the ETF Store President, Nate Geraci, shared a similar sentiment, saying that it is very significant to see the various asset managers roll out their amended S-1 filings at once and on the same day. “Very good sign IMO [in my opinion],” Geraci wrote on X. For a security or ETF to be listed on an exchange, it needs an S-1 filing, which provides a brief prospectus of the proposed security. Meanwhile, the S-1 form is amended as material information changes regarding the structure of the exchange-traded fund. Hence, it is no surprise to see some changes in the structure of proposed spot XRP ETFs. For instance, the amended S-1 filing appears to switch the exchange-traded products from simply cash creations and redemptions to allow for XRP or cash creations and cash or in-kind redemptions. It is worth mentioning that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm and manager of the largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund, has still not made a move to join the race for the spot XRP ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist, the trillion-dollar asset manager revealed earlier in August that it has no intentions to launch an XRP fund. Following a torrid start to the week, the XRP token fell beneath the $3 mark to as low as $2.8 on Friday. However, the altcoin jumped back above $3 on the back of the news of the complete dismissal of Ripple’s lawsuit and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech. As of this writing, the XRP token is valued at around $3.01, reflecting an over 5% price jump in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: 6 Things To Know About The Meta/Google Cloud AI Deal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2025/08/23/6-things-to-know-about-the-metagoogle-cloud-ai-deal/
Time Published: 2025-08-23T14:36:08Z
Full Content:
ByJohn Werner, Contributor. Meta’s new deal with Google for AI cloud hosting comes with a big price tag — the deal is reportedly worth $10 billion. That’s the equivalent of 666 million large pizzas — or two for each person in the U.S. It’s also equal to the GDP of a small country. So what’s behind this monolithic business agreement? Here are some interesting aspects of this newly announced tech partnership. The $10 billion deal with Google is part of a Meta plan to invest a total of over $100 billion in AI. Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked about this kind of scaling up, as the company lays off significant numbers of human workers, moves the survivors to departments that are heavier on AI and automates business processes like it’s going out of style. The proclaimed “Year of Efficiency” in 2023 saw a lot of this action, and Meta doesn’t seem to be slowing down. The deal also lasts until 2031, by which time we might have superhuman agents, godlike AGI and brand-new national economies built on crypto or some more out-there foundation. So you could be forgiven for imagining that, for all practical purposes, Google and Meta are essentially going to the altar and not just making a short-term deal when it comes to tech allegiances. Another thing to know about this deal is that it is, to some extent, a stopgap solution and part of the greater debate for large companies like Meta about “build vs. buy” — that is, whether it is better to use an outside vendor’s resources or build them internally. That extends to models as well as data centers: as LLMs became more ubiquitous, companies had to decide whether to run their AI applications on someone else’s model (cough cough, OpenAI) or build one themselves. And to be clear, OpenAI does have competitors, but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t have that many. In terms of data center planning, Meta already has fairly concrete plans for Prometheus and Hyperion, which are projected to provide 1 gigawatt and 5 gigawatts, respectively, over time. So after that six years, we could see a very different landscape emerging. In offering services in the cloud AI market, Google goes up against a formidable competitor. AWS has been the household brand for cloud practically since the beginning, and by now, the firm has launched AWS Bedrock, where users can actually choose among top models from OpenAI, DeepSeek or others, including Anthropic (AWS was an early backer of Claude). But the new agreement gives Google a boost in AI cloud and reportedly led to a 32% increase in revenue for the company since the deal was announced. Another part of the context is how customers, particularly smaller ones, feel about Google’s cloud services, including the new AI provisioning. Presumably, Meta would not be worried about a rug pull in terms of deprecation, but notes in places like Reddit show that others ponder whether Google Cloud is “going to last” in the competitive environment and, alternately, whether Google will choose to deprecate services. Google’s documentation reveals that Google services are subject to deprecation, so that’s something to keep in mind, but doesn’t necessarily mean that something like that is in the cards or that the company will be “churning” services and rocking smaller customers out of the boat. Regardless of its deal with Meta, Google isn’t just in the business of offering bulk. Its GCP also offers feature services like BigQuery, a serverless data warehouse, and TensorFlow, an open-source ML framework enabling multi-dimensional arrays. There’s a Kubernetes engine, object storage and more, helping the company to rival AWS’ ecosystem approach. Here are some more of Google’s AI offerings: Vertex AI: Google Cloud’s unified platform for building, training, deploying and managing machine learning models with integrated MLOps tools. Generative AI Studio: Vertex AI tool for creating, fine-tuning and deploying generative AI models using prompts and customization. Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech: prebuilt AI APIs. Vision AI: cloud-based service that analyzes images and videos, detecting objects, text, faces and visual patterns using machine learning. All of this is going to help the company to remain a powerhouse in AI cloud along with AWS and Microsoft. The deal is notable partly because of its size and partly because it involves not one but two of the companies included in the former acronym FAANG, which represented the five top tech companies in America. That list has shifted a bit, notably, with the emergence of Nvidia as king of the stock market, but Meta and Google are still two titans. Stay tuned for more.

But just because it's happened before doesn't mean it will happen again. One of the hottest debates raging right now across the crypto industry is whether or not Bitcoin will stick to its usual four-year cycle. Experts have been chiming in from both sides of the spectrum, and Crypto X is rife with hot takes (as ever). Last year, Bitcoin did something it hadn't done before when it hit a new high ahead of the halving, following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This has led some analysts and observers to believe that Bitcoin's typical cycle—when the coin hits a high the year after its halving, only to plunge by 70-80% the following year—is finished. This guy gets it. We’ve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more… https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 "It's just common sense," Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt. "More stable owners, more stable price," he added, referring to the ETF investors. The approval of ETFs in January 2024 allowed millions of dollars in capital previously locked out of the markets to flood into the space. Months after they started trading, the leading cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high. The coin has since broken new highs off the back of crypto-friendly President Donald Trump's victory, rising yet again to a fresh peak last week. Investors in the space are now more sophisticated, too: Institutions from Harvard University and Goldman Sachs have bought Bitcoin—and via the ETFs, no less. Such investors are less likely to panic-sell, and are buying to hold for the long term, Balchunas said. "I think the ETF kicked off this new phase, and I don't know if the four year cycle would apply. I don't want to say never, but again, you have to use common sense," he said. "Volatility is based on the people who hold it." Bitcoin was recently trading for $115,492 per coin, up more than 2% over the past day and by 22% year-to-date, according to CoinGecko. It broke a new record of $124,128 on August 14. In the previous bull run, Bitcoin peaked at a high of $69,044 in November 2021. But the hype didn’t last and a brutal correction occurred, leading Bitcoin to crash below $16,000 in November 2022 after a long list of crypto companies went bankrupt following the collapse of Terra—most notably the prominent digital asset exchange, FTX. Bitcoin is now much more mature, however, and further integrated into traditional markets, noted André Dragosch, Bitwise's Europe head of research. "Our thesis is that macro- and demand-related factors are definitely becoming increasingly more important due to Bitcoin's increasing integration into the global financial system," he said. Dragosch added that the performance effect from the halving—which occurs approximately every four years and slashes the BTC rewards earned by network-supporting miners—has been declining, while demand-related factors are becoming increasingly important. But not all experts agree. A report by CoinGlass this week used data to point out that this year is looking increasingly like previous cycles—especially in terms of price action. The report said that the flagship coin's price movements are echoing what was seen in the cycles of 2015-2018 and 2018–2022, and that capital inflows into the asset are "showing signs of fatigue." "Alongside this, long-term holders have realized profit levels comparable to past euphoric phases, reinforcing the impression of a market late in its cycle," the report read. But it's worth noting that every cycle, there are quirks—and HODLers will ultimately have to wait to see how things play out. "Every time that we think, 'This time it's different,' it seems that the market corrects us and shows us: 'Nope, this time it's exactly the same,'" Nick Hansen, CEO of Bitcoin mining firm Luxor, told Decrypt.

Title: BlackRock Triggers Bitcoin Sell-Offs With Half A Billion Dollars Dumped

Time Published: 2025-08-23T13:00:10Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has notably been on a Bitcoin selling spree throughout this week, triggering a wave of sell-offs in the process. These sales have occurred due to the outflows that the asset manager has witnessed from its BTC ETF. Arkham data shows that BlackRock has offloaded around $500 million in Bitcoin this week, with transfers to Coinbase, a move that indicates a move to sell these coins. The asset manager has sold these coins following outflows from its iShares Bitcoin ETF, which was the norm throughout this week. SoSo Value data shows that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF first recorded a daily net outflow of $68.72 million on August 18. The fund then further saw net outflows of $220 million, $127.49 million, and $198.81 million on August 20, 21, and 22, respectively. Notably, the iShares Bitcoin ETF has accounted for most of the outflows, with the BTC ETFs as a group currently on a six-day streak of consecutive net outflows. These Bitcoin ETFs have seen total net outflows of almost $1.2 billion since August 15. Meanwhile, in just this week alone, over $1.1 billion has left these funds, sparking a bearish sentiment for the BTC price. Given BlackRock’s position as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem, outflows from its fund had sparked a wave of sell-offs. This led to a massive decline for the flagship crypto earlier in the week. The Bitcoin price had dropped to as low as $112,000 this week as BlackRock and other BTC investors took profit on their investments. This followed the flagship crypto’s rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,000 last week. However, BTC has now sharply rebounded on the back of Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech, in which he indicated that a rate cut might happen in September. Notably, Powell’s speech was enough to spark fresh inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs on August 22, with BlackRock the only fund manager that recorded a net outflow on the day. Further data from SoSo Value shows that Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest recorded a daily inflow of $65.47 million, the most among the issuers on the day. Meanwhile, Fidelity, Van Eck, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale recorded inflows of $50.88 million, $26.41 million, $13.51 million, $12.70 million, and $6.42 million, respectively. However, BlackRock recorded an outflow of $198.81 million, which led to a daily net outflow of $23.15 million for the funds as a group. With the Bitcoin price rebounding, these funds, including BlackRock’s IBIT, could return to witnessing significant daily inflows from next week. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $115,900, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Can AI ‘sorcery’ solve the ‘productivity paradox’ that has gripped the economy for 25 years? A Shakespearean sea change is underfoot

Nick Lichtenberg is Fortune Intelligence editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. The late plays by William Shakespeare are alternately called his “romances” or his “problem plays,” because of their ambiguity in tone, as they alternate from passages of magical realism to stark scenes that grapple with complex social issues. At times, they point the way toward the prestige TV of the early 21st century where, for instance, The Sopranos could range from broad comedy to intense violence to avant-garde dream sequences, all in one episode. It’s from the romances that we get phrases that stick with us today, like the description from The Tempest of a “sea change into something rich and strange.” Full disclosure: The author’s brother is an eminent Shakespearean scholar, often quoted in The New York Times, although never previously in Fortune, and so I asked him to explain what this particular term means. “Toward the end of his career,” Drew Lichtenberg of the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington DC, said in a statement to Fortune, “Shakespeare started writing genre-defying plays with sudden and miraculous changes of fortune.” Shakespeare used the phrase “sea change” to describe a “magical storm at sea that has the power to snuff out life or restore it in less than a second.” What do Shakespeare’s plays of miraculous changes of fortune have to do with, well, Fortune? Bank of America Institute has projected a “sea change” in the economy. It sees a pivotal transformation in worker productivity at America’s largest companies, driven by lessons from post-pandemic inflation and supercharged by a wave of artificial intelligence and automation. The institute worked hand in hand with projections from Bank of America Research to project a rewiring of the fundamental valuation landscape of the S&P 500, with profound implications for investors and the “quality premium” that U.S. stocks traditionally command. Fortune talked to BofA Research’s Head of US Equity & Quantitative Strategy, Savita Subramanian, to dig into this change, potentially to something rich and strange. It’s not quite that mystical, she said, but she still thinks it’s a big deal. Subramanian explained that what her team has projected isn’t as exciting or dramatic as having actual wizards working at the gears of the economy. The more prosaic insight, she says, is that the combination of AI technology and lessons learned from the inflation wave of the 2020s mean that worker productivity is finally showing signs of increasing. That’s the sea change taking place. At its heart, her work is all about the famous “productivity paradox” identified by Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Solow. “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics,” he said in 1987, long before the productivity crisis of the 21st century set in. As Fortune‘s Jeremy Kahn has discussed, workers still don’t seem to be getting more productive despite the bevy of new technologies at their disposal. In fact, McKinsey’s Chris White and Olivia White argued in 2024 that productivity has been dismal for nearly a generation, hovering around 1% a year, with a dip after the Great Financial Crisis. Subramanian agrees, telling Fortune that if you look at productivity measures, “they haven’t really improved all that much since 2001.” Subramanian wrote on Aug. 8 that the end goal of the massive AI spending that’s rippling through the economy is a “sea-change” in the scale and scope of efficiency gains—and this productivity cycle is already under way. Post-pandemic wage inflation forced companies “to do more with fewer people,” she added, and now AI tools are due to kick that up a notch. But the official stats don’t show a complete understanding of how productivity really functions, Subramanian explained. So BofA took sales, adjusted for inflation, and then divided sales by the number of people working at S&P 500 companies, showing real sales growth versus number of people, what she called a “decent proxy” for productivity, “because if you’re productive, you are doing things more efficiently, you need less labor. And this is more labor efficiency than anything else.” Look at what she found. This means companies are learning to do more with less, and that is kind of magical. Companies have had to do harder work to generate earnings and keep margins healthy, often by replacing their people with processes. “A process is almost free and it’s replicable for eternity,” she said, adding that she thinks this is why the companies exercising efficiency gains have tended to outperform. It’s not only about AI displacing workers, but a fundamental shift in how business is being done. This discussion may seem on its face to be more boring than a tempest and a wizard, she said, but there is something supernatural about the current moment. “I think people love this AI technology because it feels like sorcery,” she said, before adding, “the truth is it hasn’t really changed the world that much yet, but I don’t think it’s something to be dismissed.” Overall, Subramanian finds the S&P 500 has shifted from its 1980s model of asset- and labor-intensive manufacturing to asset- and labor-light innovation, namely tech and health care firms. Showing her work, she calculates that the S&P 500 firms with a focus on innovation, measured through high research and development expenditures, trade at structurally higher multiples of 29x forward earnings per share. More capital-intensive manufacturers, on the other hand, trade at a 21x multiple. The current AI boom is actually a bit risky, she wrote, because the massive data center investments represent a shift from an asset-light to an asset-heavier focus. To be sure, BofA finds that the S&P 500 is now statistically expensive on 19 out of the 20 metrics that they track, including P/E, price to book, price to cash flow, and market cap/GDP. That’s where the sea change matters, because if the shift from manufacturing to innovation is real, then valuations have to shift as well. Hence the “innovation premium” from BofA’s research. Excluding Tesla, Subramanian talks about the other members of the “Magnificent Seven” as evidence of firms losing some of their innovation premium as a result of a shift toward asset-heaviness. As a basket of stocks, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Apple’s average shareholder yield (i.e., dividends plus net buybacks) has dropped by over 1% since 2015. There are other shifts afoot as well, she told Fortune. “We seem to be at least pausing on this globalization theme,” she said, citing China’s admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 as a big driver of margin expansion, enabling cost-cutting as a huge lever to keep margins expanding. (It was also the year when worker productivity froze in its tracks.) In the globalization regime, “you didn’t have to think too hard to make money and expand your margins,” she said. It was “very easy and fungible and frictionless” for companies to buy things from different places and contain costs. She also cited the low-interest-rate environment that persisted for much of the past few decades, enabling lots of “financial engineering.” For example, Subramanian said it was common to see companies that knew they would miss their earnings estimates borrowing money and buying back stock to hit their targets, adding the caveat that “there are good reasons to do share buybacks and bad reasons to do share buybacks.” This all “really created a lot of bizarre behavior.” Warren Buffett’s long-time fondness for stock buybacks has even come under fire from other investors, with Jeremy Grantham writing in 2023 that it facilitates stock manipulation and should be illegal. BofA Research found in July 2025, however, that stock buybacks had decelerated a bit, albeit they remained high by historical standards. The situation now is harder in many ways, but companies aren’t able to financially engineer their way to earnings growth, she added. Now that’s a sea change. One final note on the Shakespearean romances, from Drew Lichtenberg: that appellation came about in the late 1700s, nearly two centuries after Shakespeare’s lifetime, with the birth of the romantic movement. The word “romantic” had previously existed, but it didn’t have its current meaning until Samuel Taylor Coleridge elevated it to mean something that connects back directly to nature and the divine genius of humanity’s self-expression. This was largely a response to the Enlightenment’s elevation of reason and logic and its ultimate achievement: the Industrial Revolution that unleashed modern capitalism on the world. A sea change, indeed. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Ethereum eyes historic highs amid mixed institutional signals: What’s next?

Market momentum remains strong as ETH approaches its 2021 peak. Ethereum is nearing its all-time high despite mixed signals from institutions. Market momentum and bullish sentiment suggests potential for further gains. Ethereum [ETH] hits fresh highs even as institutional money appeared to be heading for the exit. Outflows from spot ETH ETFs have been heavy, yet big names like keep buying. There’s a striking divergence in sentiment: while some institutions are cashing out, other heavyweight players seem intent on staying. Ethereum traded at $4,737 at press time, just shy of its all-time high of $4,891 set back in November 2021 according to CoinMarketCap. The hourly chart highlighted an upward move (with Jerome Powell Jackson Hole speech being a key catalyst) followed by consolidation, so bulls were defending the higher levels. The RSI was at 62.8, indicating strong momentum but leaving some room before hitting overbought territory. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the MACD showed waning bullish momentum as the histogram turned red. If buying pressure persists, ETH could attempt another run at its historic peak, though short-term corrections remain likely given the recent volatility. ETH is chasing new highs, but there’s more to it than what meets the eye. Source: Glassnode On one hand, U.S. spot ETFs have been under pressure, with Ethereum ETFs recording a staggering 111k ETH in outflows. Yet, not all major players are retreating. BlackRock recently purchased $233 million worth of ETH, showing long-term conviction in the asset. Source: Arkham Intelligence Adding to the bullish narrative, Trump’s World Liberty fund also made a notable acquisition, spending $5.025 million USDC for 1,076 ETH at $4,670. Source: X Amid the mixed institutional flows, one of crypto’s most influential voices remains firmly bullish on Ethereum. Since first declaring “$ETH = $5,000” back in December 2023, Arthur Hayes has actively swing-traded ETH through his public wallet, often selling only to buy back at higher prices as the token continued its ascent. Source: X Now, the Maelstrom CIO has reaffirmed his conviction, forecasting a monumental rally. In a recent Crypto Banter interview, Hayes argued that, “the chart says it’s going higher, you can’t fight the market.” He predicted that Ethereum could surge to $10,000-$20,000 before the end of this cycle.

Title: 18 months after becoming the first human implanted with Elon Musk’s brain chip, Neuralink ‘Participant 1’ Noland Arbaugh says his whole life has changed

Jessica Mathews is a senior writer for Fortune covering startups and the venture capital industry. It was February 2024 when Noland Arbaugh, the first person to get Elon Musk’s experimental brain chip, rolled across the stage in a wheelchair during a Neuralink “all hands” meeting, revealing his identity for the first time. The room, filled with Neuralink employees, erupted in applause as Arbaugh—who dislocated two of his vertebrae in a swimming accident in 2016 and has since lost sensation and movement below his shoulders—smiled ear to ear in his chair, a red Texas A&M hat planted on his head. He grinned as he began to speak: “Hello, humans.” About a month before that town hall, Arbaugh had undergone surgery at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, about 2.5 hours from his home in Yuma, to get an experimental chip embedded into his brain that Neuralink had been working on and testing on animals for the past nine years. Arbaugh was anesthetized and, in a surgery that lasted just under two hours, a Neuralink-made robotic surgery device implanted the chip and connected tiny threads with more than 1,000 electrodes to the neurons in his brain. Now the device can measure electrical activity, process signals, then translate those signals into commands to a digital device. In layman’s speak, the BCI, or brain-computer interface, allows Arbaugh to control a computer with his mind. As a result, Arbaugh can do things like play Mario Kart, control his television, and turn his Dyson air purifier on and off without physically moving his fingers or any other part of his body. The first day that Arbaugh used his device, he beat the 2017 world record for speed and precision in BCI cursor control. “It was very, very easy to learn how to use,” he tells me in an interview. When Arbaugh became Participant 1—or “P1” as he is often referred to by Neuralink employees and subsequent study participants—he joined a list of about 80 people to ever receive such a device. Brain chip interfaces have been a focus of neurological study for more than 50 years, and a dozen companies in the U.S. and China have been conducting limited human trials since 1998. But becoming the first patient to get a Neuralink implant, in particular, is its own right of passage. For one, Neuralink’s device has threads with more than 1,000 electrodes, giving the device a much higher connectivity rate than most of the BCIs currently being studied in humans in the market. But Neuralink also places its electrodes in the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls movement—a more invasive approach than competitors like Synchron or Precision Neuroscience, which also have ongoing studies of multiple patients. Neuralink’s device is also wireless, versus competitors like Blackrock Neurotech that require a wired connection from the implant through the skull to an external receiver for signal capture and decoding (Blackrock Neurotech sells a wireless processor that has been used for research). That means Neuralink participants can go cordless, but the device is battery powered because of it and does need to be charged around every five hours or so, Arbaugh says. Neuralink heat-treats the charger, a coil, into some of Arbaugh’s hats, so that he can recharge it while wearing a hat. In the beginning, Arbaugh couldn’t use the device while it charged, though that’s since been updated. Of course, there is also the fact that Neuralink is Elon Musk’s brain chip company, which draws an entirely different level of scrutiny and attention to any study participant. Since Arbaugh revealed himself as P1, he has become a public figure, frequently invited on podcasts and having journalists show up at his home. His X account has been hacked, and he told me that a SWAT team showed up with AR-15s after someone gave a false tip to the local sheriff’s office that Arbaugh was in danger. When I first reached out to Arbaugh in early June to see how the BCI had changed his day-to-day 1.5 years in, it took a couple of months for us to pin down a time. When we finally did hop on the phone, he laughed. “I’m just so busy all the time,” he says. “That is so different than what life was like before…I feel like I’m playing catch-up for eight years of not doing anything—kind of lying around, staring at walls.” Since Arbaugh became the first Neuralink patient in January 2024, there have been eight more individuals, including one woman, to enroll in the company’s ongoing clinical trials, which are now open in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, and the United Arab Emirates. So far, all of the surgeries have taken place at hospitals in the U.S., with two of the participants receiving the implant on the same day at the end of July. All of the study participants suffer from either paralysis or ALS, a nervous system disease that causes loss of muscle control. “Our goal is to really build a whole brain interface,” Neuralink cofounder and president DJ Seo said during Neuralink’s summer update meeting. For Arbaugh, the Neuralink device has been entirely transformative, he says. He uses it about 10 hours a day to control his computer so he can study, read, and game—and to handle things like scheduling an interview with me. Arbaugh enrolled in classes at his community college in Arizona, where he has started taking prerequisites he needs for a degree in neuroscience, and, as he tells Fortune, he’s working on starting his own business—paid professional speaking engagements and live talks. As he talks about all of it with me, his excitement—and a newfound sense of purpose—is palpable. Before his surgery, “I would stay up all night and sleep all day, and I didn’t really [want to] bother anyone or ruin any plans or get in the way of anything,” he says. “I just had no purpose…I was just kind of going through the motions, waiting for something to happen.” Arbaugh never lost the ability to think or speak due to his accident. But in the past year and a half, he has regained more of the autonomy he lost with his disability, and is able to do more things for himself. “I feel like I have potential again. I guess I always have had potential, but now I’m finding a way to fulfill that potential in meaningful ways. It’s a lot different.” When you talk to Arbaugh, he makes all of it seem rather simple. He had never heard of a BCI, or Neuralink for that matter, until his friend from military school, an Elon Musk buff, learned of the first Neuralink clinical trial while researching SpaceX at the end of 2023, Arbaugh recalls. The friend, Greg Bain, reached out to Arbaugh, who signed up to join the very same day (though Bain spelled his name wrong on the application). “I never doubted for a second that it would work,” Arbaugh, who personally didn’t have strong opinions of Elon Musk one way or another, says. Arbaugh says he received an email from the Barrow Neurological Institute the day after he applied and started going through the process. There was a screening call and an interview, and then about a month later he was going into the nearby hospital for a full day of scans and testing. About three months after he applied, Arbaugh found out that he was going to be the first participant, and his surgery was scheduled a few weeks later. While Arbaugh is not paid, Neuralink covers the cost of the surgery and the implant, and the company reimburses him for travel to and from his checkups or for expenses directly related to the study. (Arbaugh says that with FDA approval, Neuralink did pay him for two talks he gave at Neuralink, including the February 2024 talk where he revealed his identity.) Despite the risks of being the first participant of an experimental clinical trial, Arbaugh says it was an easy decision for him. “I decided that, even if it didn’t work—even if something went terribly wrong—I knew that it would help someone down the road,” Arbaugh says. “And I knew that good or bad, they would learn something and push this technology forward.” Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine,’ but I still see myself as a regular guy. As you may imagine, it was a little harder for his parents. Arbaugh says he remembers sending his mother the consent forms he had to sign for her to read over, which contained a laundry list of potential risks associated with the surgery—and every imaginable thing that could go wrong with the experimental device. He said she read one or two items and then put them away, unable to read any further. But ultimately, both his parents supported his decision, he says, and never showed that the decision was hard on them. “I hadn’t really been excited about many things before that point, so they were just happy to help in any way they could,” he says. Arbaugh was also extremely decisive in his choice to go public with his identity. He says he wanted to show people that he believed this device was safe, and what could be possible for those who used it. “I wanted to share it with people, because I thought it was huge, and I still do,” Arbaugh says. “I think it’s one of the biggest leaps in technology that we’ve had in a really long time, and I think that it’s going to keep growing.” Arbaugh insists that Neuralink has never tried to dictate what he can or can’t say publicly, and he says he has never been asked to sign any kind of nondisclosure agreement. It’s been the opposite, he says: Neuralink staffers have encouraged him to disclose whatever he’d like to. But he has voluntarily chosen not to talk about some things on occasion. For example, shortly after his surgery, some of the threads retracted, causing him to lose much of the control he had over the device. The incident was later published in the Wall Street Journal, and Neuralink published a blog post about it. It was a big deal, Arbaugh says, but he decided to wait for the team to figure out what had happened and how to repair it, which they did. Revealing something like that at the time would have been “extremely rash of me, and it would have absolutely made people lose faith in the product,” he says. “That’s not what I want. I love this thing. I love what Neuralink is doing. I love all of it, and I’m really proud of it.” In the summer update meeting Neuralink published publicly, Seo laid out what the company is focused on next. Neuralink is starting a trial in the United Arab Emirates, called Blindsight, that would help restore sight to the blind. Neuralink is already developing robotic arms for participants, and, during the presentation, Musk said that the company wants to give them sensory control to where they could essentially “inhabit an Optimus robot” and control it with their minds, or attach an Optimus arm or leg to a person to give them full control again of that part of their body. “The future is going to be weird, but pretty cool,” he said. As of right now, Neuralink is still adding patients to its various trials. At the end of July, Neuralink announced it had received approval to introduce a trial in Great Britain via University College London Hospitals and Newcastle Hospitals. Neuralink still has plenty of critics for its more invasive BCI approach and—true to form for all of Elon Musk’s companies—the high employee expectations and long work hours that have led to high turnover. Neuralink has also been accused of poor treatment of the monkeys it has used to test its Link devices. (Regarding treatment of its animals, Neuralink says it works with animals in “the most humane and ethical way possible.” Several of the Neuralink study participants that I spoke to also contested the claim of animal mistreatment.) While some of Musk’s other companies, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, have been accused of being lax when it comes to safety precautions, Musk is adamant that Neuralink is moving slowly and carefully as Neuralink tests its brain chips. “We’re very cautious with the Neuralinks in humans,” Musk said during the summer update. “That’s the reason we’re not moving faster than we are is because we are taking great care with each individual to make sure we never miss.” As more Neuralink patients become vocal about the Neuralink BCI and the company, Neuralink is garnering more global recognition, and investors are pouring in hundreds of millions of capital. Indeed, there is something uniquely compelling about the vision at Neuralink and its mission to help those with disabilities. And there’s something uniquely compelling about Arbaugh, too. Perhaps it’s his sense of humor, his earnestness, or his humility—but it’s hard not to like him at once. He speaks about his three conversations with Musk—once via FaceTime the day of his surgery, in person post-surgery, then later at the Austin gigafactory—nonchalantly, saying Musk is a “cool dude” who “has done a lot in his life and is super impressive, but at the end of the day is just another guy.” After our interview, I asked Arbaugh if he considers himself a cyborg—the sci-fi term coined in the ’60s to describe a human being who has been enhanced by a technological body part or device. “Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine,’” he says. “But I still see myself as a regular guy…But it’s fun to play around with.” A year-and-a-half after his surgery, Arbaugh still has so much to say about all of it: about neuroscience, about his faith, and about what technology is making possible for paralysis. This whole ordeal has given him a new appreciation for what’s possible, he says: “I always thought that [paralysis was] going to be fixed through drugs, or some sort of new surgery, or something they discovered in science—stem cells or something of that nature.” But now that he has been thrust into the tech world, Arbaugh says he’s thinking about it differently. “I see how the advancements in tech at this point are going to solve so many things. They are, I think, the future of medicine. I think a lot of disabilities, cures, and answers that we’ve been searching for a long time will come through tech—and that kind of surprised me.” In the meantime, there is a lot for him to soak up in this new way of life—where he can play Mario Kart with his dad, go back to college, and build a business: “I definitely didn’t expect for this to ever happen,” he says. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

For one, Neuralink’s device has threads with more than 1,000 electrodes, giving the device a much higher connectivity rate than most of the BCIs currently being studied in humans in the market. But Neuralink also places its electrodes in the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls movement—a more invasive approach than competitors like Synchron or Precision Neuroscience, which also have ongoing studies of multiple patients. Neuralink’s device is also wireless, versus competitors like Blackrock Neurotech that require a wired connection from the implant through the skull to an external receiver for signal capture and decoding (Blackrock Neurotech sells a wireless processor that has been used for research). That means Neuralink participants can go cordless, but the device is battery powered because of it and does need to be charged around every five hours or so, Arbaugh says. Neuralink heat-treats the charger, a coil, into some of Arbaugh’s hats, so that he can recharge it while wearing a hat. In the beginning, Arbaugh couldn’t use the device while it charged, though that’s since been updated. Of course, there is also the fact that Neuralink is Elon Musk’s brain chip company, which draws an entirely different level of scrutiny and attention to any study participant. Since Arbaugh revealed himself as P1, he has become a public figure, frequently invited on podcasts and having journalists show up at his home. His X account has been hacked, and he told me that a SWAT team showed up with AR-15s after someone gave a false tip to the local sheriff’s office that Arbaugh was in danger. When I first reached out to Arbaugh in early June to see how the BCI had changed his day-to-day 1.5 years in, it took a couple of months for us to pin down a time. When we finally did hop on the phone, he laughed. “I’m just so busy all the time,” he says. “That is so different than what life was like before…I feel like I’m playing catch-up for eight years of not doing anything—kind of lying around, staring at walls.” Since Arbaugh became the first Neuralink patient in January 2024, there have been eight more individuals, including one woman, to enroll in the company’s ongoing clinical trials, which are now open in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, and the United Arab Emirates. So far, all of the surgeries have taken place at hospitals in the U.S., with two of the participants receiving the implant on the same day at the end of July. All of the study participants suffer from either paralysis or ALS, a nervous system disease that causes loss of muscle control. “Our goal is to really build a whole brain interface,” Neuralink cofounder and president DJ Seo said during Neuralink’s summer update meeting. For Arbaugh, the Neuralink device has been entirely transformative, he says. He uses it about 10 hours a day to control his computer so he can study, read, and game—and to handle things like scheduling an interview with me. Arbaugh enrolled in classes at his community college in Arizona, where he has started taking prerequisites he needs for a degree in neuroscience, and, as he tells Fortune, he’s working on starting his own business—paid professional speaking engagements and live talks. As he talks about all of it with me, his excitement—and a newfound sense of purpose—is palpable. Before his surgery, “I would stay up all night and sleep all day, and I didn’t really [want to] bother anyone or ruin any plans or get in the way of anything,” he says. “I just had no purpose…I was just kind of going through the motions, waiting for something to happen.” Arbaugh never lost the ability to think or speak due to his accident. But in the past year and a half, he has regained more of the autonomy he lost with his disability, and is able to do more things for himself. “I feel like I have potential again. I guess I always have had potential, but now I’m finding a way to fulfill that potential in meaningful ways. It’s a lot different.” When you talk to Arbaugh, he makes all of it seem rather simple. He had never heard of a BCI, or Neuralink for that matter, until his friend from military school, an Elon Musk buff, learned of the first Neuralink clinical trial while researching SpaceX at the end of 2023, Arbaugh recalls. The friend, Greg Bain, reached out to Arbaugh, who signed up to join the very same day (though Bain spelled his name wrong on the application). “I never doubted for a second that it would work,” Arbaugh, who personally didn’t have strong opinions of Elon Musk one way or another, says. Arbaugh says he received an email from the Barrow Neurological Institute the day after he applied and started going through the process. There was a screening call and an interview, and then about a month later he was going into the nearby hospital for a full day of scans and testing. About three months after he applied, Arbaugh found out that he was going to be the first participant, and his surgery was scheduled a few weeks later. While Arbaugh is not paid, Neuralink covers the cost of the surgery and the implant, and the company reimburses him for travel to and from his checkups or for expenses directly related to the study. (Arbaugh says that with FDA approval, Neuralink did pay him for two talks he gave at Neuralink, including the February 2024 talk where he revealed his identity.) Despite the risks of being the first participant of an experimental clinical trial, Arbaugh says it was an easy decision for him. “I decided that, even if it didn’t work—even if something went terribly wrong—I knew that it would help someone down the road,” Arbaugh says. “And I knew that good or bad, they would learn something and push this technology forward.” Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine,’ but I still see myself as a regular guy. As you may imagine, it was a little harder for his parents. Arbaugh says he remembers sending his mother the consent forms he had to sign for her to read over, which contained a laundry list of potential risks associated with the surgery—and every imaginable thing that could go wrong with the experimental device. He said she read one or two items and then put them away, unable to read any further. But ultimately, both his parents supported his decision, he says, and never showed that the decision was hard on them. “I hadn’t really been excited about many things before that point, so they were just happy to help in any way they could,” he says. Arbaugh was also extremely decisive in his choice to go public with his identity. He says he wanted to show people that he believed this device was safe, and what could be possible for those who used it. “I wanted to share it with people, because I thought it was huge, and I still do,” Arbaugh says. “I think it’s one of the biggest leaps in technology that we’ve had in a really long time, and I think that it’s going to keep growing.” Arbaugh insists that Neuralink has never tried to dictate what he can or can’t say publicly, and he says he has never been asked to sign any kind of nondisclosure agreement. It’s been the opposite, he says: Neuralink staffers have encouraged him to disclose whatever he’d like to. But he has voluntarily chosen not to talk about some things on occasion. For example, shortly after his surgery, some of the threads retracted, causing him to lose much of the control he had over the device. The incident was later published in the Wall Street Journal, and Neuralink published a blog post about it. It was a big deal, Arbaugh says, but he decided to wait for the team to figure out what had happened and how to repair it, which they did. Revealing something like that at the time would have been “extremely rash of me, and it would have absolutely made people lose faith in the product,” he says. “That’s not what I want. I love this thing. I love what Neuralink is doing. I love all of it, and I’m really proud of it.” In the summer update meeting Neuralink published publicly, Seo laid out what the company is focused on next. Neuralink is starting a trial in the United Arab Emirates, called Blindsight, that would help restore sight to the blind. Neuralink is already developing robotic arms for participants, and, during the presentation, Musk said that the company wants to give them sensory control to where they could essentially “inhabit an Optimus robot” and control it with their minds, or attach an Optimus arm or leg to a person to give them full control again of that part of their body. “The future is going to be weird, but pretty cool,” he said. As of right now, Neuralink is still adding patients to its various trials. At the end of July, Neuralink announced it had received approval to introduce a trial in Great Britain via University College London Hospitals and Newcastle Hospitals. Neuralink still has plenty of critics for its more invasive BCI approach and—true to form for all of Elon Musk’s companies—the high employee expectations and long work hours that have led to high turnover. Neuralink has also been accused of poor treatment of the monkeys it has used to test its Link devices. (Regarding treatment of its animals, Neuralink says it works with animals in “the most humane and ethical way possible.” Several of the Neuralink study participants that I spoke to also contested the claim of animal mistreatment.) While some of Musk’s other companies, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, have been accused of being lax when it comes to safety precautions, Musk is adamant that Neuralink is moving slowly and carefully as Neuralink tests its brain chips. “We’re very cautious with the Neuralinks in humans,” Musk said during the summer update. “That’s the reason we’re not moving faster than we are is because we are taking great care with each individual to make sure we never miss.” As more Neuralink patients become vocal about the Neuralink BCI and the company, Neuralink is garnering more global recognition, and investors are pouring in hundreds of millions of capital. Indeed, there is something uniquely compelling about the vision at Neuralink and its mission to help those with disabilities. And there’s something uniquely compelling about Arbaugh, too. Perhaps it’s his sense of humor, his earnestness, or his humility—but it’s hard not to like him at once. He speaks about his three conversations with Musk—once via FaceTime the day of his surgery, in person post-surgery, then later at the Austin gigafactory—nonchalantly, saying Musk is a “cool dude” who “has done a lot in his life and is super impressive, but at the end of the day is just another guy.” After our interview, I asked Arbaugh if he considers himself a cyborg—the sci-fi term coined in the ’60s to describe a human being who has been enhanced by a technological body part or device. “Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine,’” he says. “But I still see myself as a regular guy…But it’s fun to play around with.” A year-and-a-half after his surgery, Arbaugh still has so much to say about all of it: about neuroscience, about his faith, and about what technology is making possible for paralysis. This whole ordeal has given him a new appreciation for what’s possible, he says: “I always thought that [paralysis was] going to be fixed through drugs, or some sort of new surgery, or something they discovered in science—stem cells or something of that nature.” But now that he has been thrust into the tech world, Arbaugh says he’s thinking about it differently. “I see how the advancements in tech at this point are going to solve so many things. They are, I think, the future of medicine. I think a lot of disabilities, cures, and answers that we’ve been searching for a long time will come through tech—and that kind of surprised me.” In the meantime, there is a lot for him to soak up in this new way of life—where he can play Mario Kart with his dad, go back to college, and build a business: “I definitely didn’t expect for this to ever happen,” he says.

Title: A Microsoft veteran says declining morale and a 'culture shift' drove him to resign: 'The great flattening was definitely happening'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-culture-change-employee-resigned-found-new-job-2025-8

Full Content:
Phil Coachman loved working at Microsoft for most of his nearly decadelong tenure. But as the culture began to shift and layoffs piled up, he decided it was time to move on. He started looking for a new role in July 2024 when he was still at Microsoft, but struggled to get much traction. In January, he resigned from his role as a senior cloud solution architect to focus on his job search. "I just didn't feel happy there anymore," said the 44-year-old, who lives in Pennsylvania. "I wanted to just continue making cool stuff and not have this constant fear of losing my job every week." Coachman said company layoffs — including the elimination of about 10,000 roles in 2023 — took a toll on his morale and that of his co-workers. He said he knew several people who were let go, including one teammate he regarded as a "top performer." "Every team that I worked with was just down," he said. "So now you go to work and everybody's depressed every day." Coachman is among the current and former Microsoft employees who have been affected by workforce reductions — either by losing a job or being left to adjust to coworker departures. After cutting about 6,000 jobs in May, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also included many individual contributor roles. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." Layoffs remain low by historical standards, but tech workers have been hit hard — just as white-collar hiring has slowed. That's made it more difficult for workers like Coachman to switch jobs — or find new ones after they resign or are laid off. "It just got to a point where morale was no longer up to par," Coachman said, "and ultimately it got to a place where it was time to make a change." Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: After working as a Microsoft contractor for several years, Coachman joined the company full-time in 2015. He said he's extremely grateful for his time at the company, and that before joining, he was earning far less and just trying to get by. He'd be open to returning in the future, he said, if he saw signs of a positive culture shift. During his final years at Microsoft, Coachman said there appeared to be a push to reduce the number of managers in an effort to increase what the company calls "span of control" — or the number of employees who report to each manager. While his own manager's number of direct reports didn't change during his time on the team, he said they are now working in an individual contributor role. He also said he saw the number of reports per manager increase on other teams. "I saw managers leave and other managers absorb that head count, so you go from managing 10 people to now maybe 18 people, which when you talk to those managers, becomes really hard," he said. "The great flattening was definitely happening." Beyond layoffs and shifts in management structure, Coachman said he also began being asked to focus more on performance metrics, which he felt came at the cost of flexibility and meaningful customer work. In recent years, Big Tech firms, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, have revamped their performance review and compensation structures to better reward top performers and weed out underperformers in pursuit of smaller, higher-performing teams. Another key factor in his decision to resign was the uptick in business travel. He said he was on the road about three times a month — a return to pre-pandemic norms. "It just got to a point where I was missing too much of my kids' lives," he said, adding that his work frustrations made travel less tolerable. "It was different when I was traveling and the job was awesome." When Coachman started his job search in July 2024, he thought it was going to be fairly easy. There seemed to be plenty of job postings on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, so after pinpointing a few roles he felt qualified for, he figured he'd be able to get interviews and eventually land an offer. But he quickly realized it wouldn't be that simple. After all, US businesses were hiring at nearly the slowest pace in more than a decade. "It was six months of basically just being ghosted," he said. "It was a completely different world than when I had applied to a job decades ago." Coachman said he went through several rounds of résumé tweaks — thinking the format might be the issue — but still got little response. As his job search dragged on, Coachman said he was hesitant to resign from his Microsoft job before having another role lined up because it would mean giving up a steady paycheck and unvested company stock. However, he said the "rainy day fund" he'd built over the years helped him feel more comfortable. "I had enough savings that even if it would take me a year to find a job, I would be fine," he said. "So it was just getting the courage to take that jump." In early 2024, Coachman said he hired a life coach — in part to help him navigate the changes he was experiencing at work. He said the life coach helped him get confident in his decision to resign, adding that hiring them was maybe the "best investment" he'd ever made. After resigning, Coachman said he adjusted his job search strategy. Rather than simply applying for jobs, he spent more time tapping into the network he'd built over the years. He targeted roles at companies where he knew someone, then reached out to ask whether they thought he'd be a good fit — and if they'd be willing to refer him. In one instance, he saw a few open roles at the data analytics and AI startup Databricks, where a former Microsoft colleague of his worked. After reaching out, Coachman said they recommended he focus on one specific role that they'd be willing to refer him for. The next day, Coachman received a call from a company recruiter. After the interview process, he received an offer and started working for the company in April. "Finding my next gig was 100% through my network," he said. Coachman said his pay is comparable to what he earned at Microsoft, and that the signing bonus helped make up for what he left behind in unvested stock. He said his travel is also now limited to no more than once a month, which was a big factor in his decision to accept the offer. Over the course of his roughly nine-month job search, Coachman said he applied to hundreds of jobs and received two offers — one for his current role and another from a startup he turned down due to concerns about job security. His top advice for job seekers: build your network and lean on it. Rather than just connecting on LinkedIn, he said, it's better to have real conversations that help foster relationships. He said this could boost your chances of landing a referral down the road — giving your application the "personal touch" it might need to get past applicant tracking system scanners. "It's real connections with people that I think make all the difference," he said. Jump to

Title: Whales scramble to grab ONDO under $1 as tokenization booms 7000%

Tokenization grew 7000% with ONDO leading the charge, but its price is stalling. U.S. Treasuries surged 7,000% since 2023, led by ONDO’s growth this year. But despite support at $0.90, reversal patterns hint at possible downside. Ondo Finance [ONDO] has been down by 2% on the day, but still leading other Real World Assets (RWA) coins. The altcoin was not left out in the recent decline across the broader market that has extended to stocks. Tokenization of RWAs has recently grown exponentially since the start of Trump’s second term. Momentum grew after the White House Bitcoin report mentioned ONDO, positioning the altcoin as a leader in this space. Per a post by Dami Defi on X, U.S. treasuries tokenized on blockchain had grown by about 7000% in only two years. The category was led by BlackRock, followed by ONDO, which surged by 120% since the start of 2025. Ethereum [ETH], Chainlink LINK], and Solana [SOL] were the leading layers for tokenizing. Messari highlighted that ONDO had grown to over $1.3 billion AUM, which was about 33% of all tokenized assets. Source: Token Terminal Its stablecoins issued on Solana blockchain grew to $250 million, accounting for about 64%. This showed ONDO was dominating deployment of RWAs which was expected to hit $30 trillion by 2034, as per Standard Chartered. Onchain data from Arkham Intelligence showed that a whale was busy accumulating the altcoin under $1 valuation. Their wallet longed about 1.35 million ONDO equivalent to $1.26 million at the time of writing. This came as the leadership expanded minting of stocks to CoWSwap, as per data from EtherScan. They actively tested by deploying American Express on ONDO using CoWSwap. Source: EtherScan The expansion aligned with ONDO’s goal of easing tokenization while ensuring there was enough reach. That way, more protocols onboarded, and user growth could follow since they directly correlate. Despite this huge milestone in terms of tokenizing and chain activity, ONDO price was stalling. Its price had formed two bearish reversal patterns, suggesting more downside potential was due. Initial pattern led to a price drop from $1.15 to $0.85. The second has seen ONDO drop from $1.10 to $0.90, where it set up a floor. Still, the ability of $0.90, holding was dependent on wider market reaction, especially for Bitcoin [BTC]. With the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at 0.17 and in an uptrend, it signaled capital inflow. This supported the aforementioned capital inflow from the whale’s wallet. Source: TradingView The heads and shoulders pattern hinted at further drops. Therefore, revisiting $0.85 could not be ruled out. However, the anticipation was for the zone to hold for a rebound. Failure could invalidate a potential reversal. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Glamorous Waterford Crystal lighting for your home

Collecting antiques is one of the best ways to pay homage to the craftsmanship of bygone eras. Although trends come and go, experts say that quality pieces will always hold their value in the long term. With this in mind, it’s interesting to see Waterford Crystal chandeliers in Keighery’s next online auction in Waterford city on Monday, August 25th. Crystal may no longer be as fashionable, but it was once a symbol of prestige and glamour. Waterford Crystal was known not only for its homeware collections of glasses, bowls, vases and, yes, even chandeliers, but the Irish-made crystal was also used in trophies for sporting competitions. Irish people have great pride in the history of the brand, which dates from the 1780s. While production ceased in the late 19th century, it was then reintroduced after the second World War. The revival, by two Czechs, Karel (Charles) Bacik and Miroslav Havel, was a fascinating chapter of Waterford Crystal, as Havel drew on old pattern books of the original Waterford flint glass works stored in the National Museum to create new designs. Waterford Crystal chandeliers were hung in Westminster Abbey for its 900th anniversary in 1966, and later, Waterford Crystal chandeliers graced the halls of Windsor Castle and the Kennedy Centre in Washington, DC. More than a billion people watched a huge Waterford Crystal ball as part of the countdown at the millennium ball on New Year’s Eve in Times Square, New York, in 1999. Sadly, Waterford Wedgwood, as it became, went into receivership in 2009, and was later acquired by the Finnish group Fiskars. Most Waterford Crystal is no longer made in Ireland. The Keighery’s auction has 16 lots of Waterford Crystal lighting in total. This includes three nine-branch chandeliers (€2,000-€3,000 each); eight five-branch chandeliers (€1,000-€1,500 each); and three Brenda ceiling lights (€500-800 each). There is also two lots of wall lights. All the chandeliers at Keighery’s auction date from the 1960s and 1970s, with the original Waterford acid stamp. Auctions specialising in tableware, furniture and eclectic design pieces offer homeowners an opportunity to refresh the style of their interiors with new additions. Adam’s At Home online auction on Wednesday, August 27th, is a case in point. It has a wide selection of silver – both functional and ornamental – as well as plenty of antique cutlery sets of forks, spoons, platters and other tableware. The curators of the Adam’s auction suggest the pairing of antique plates and dishes with silverware, perhaps prompting a new design trend for dinner party table design as the autumn evenings beckon. Adding striking pieces to a table – whether that’s an ornately patterned serving dish, a silver saucière (sauce or gravy boat) or colourful antique glasses – can spark unexpected conversations over a meal. A tea and coffee service with a coffee pot, teapot, cream jug and sugar bowl (€1,500-€2,500) by Irish silversmith and jewellery designer Michael Hilliar and eight 18th-century octagonal blue-and-white Chinese porcelain dishes (€150-€300) are among the items that caught our attention. The 19th-century oval satinwood and burr walnut breakfast table (€800-€1,000) and the pair of brass mounted stained oak bedside tables (€400-€600), are also practical sizes for contemporary homes. Among the rugs for sale is a Middle Eastern wool rug, with a large standing lion (€500-€1,000). This would work either as a wall hanging or on the floor in a period or contemporary living space. The latter was purchased from the late Swedish-born antiques carpet expert Per Lindfors, who ran the Peter Linden Gallery in Blackrock from 1979 to 2006, and later advised private clients worldwide on antique carpets and rugs until his death in 2024. Viewing for the Adam’s At Home auction starts on Saturday, August 23rd, and continues until Tuesday, August 26th, in Adam’s St Stephen’s Green showrooms. Hegarty Antiques in Bandon, County Cork is also hosting a live online auction from 11am on Tuesday, August 26th. Among the wide range of silverware for sale are two unusual pieces that might work perfectly as unique gifts. The first is a pair of Chinese silver filigree enamel bird figurines (€150-€300). These intricate pieces, made in the early 1900s, have filigree silver inset with multicoloured enamel to feathers, beak and eyes.

August 22, 2025 18:59 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: The Great Crypto Divide: Why Wall Street’s old guard still won’t touch crypto

Franklin Templeton's Max Gokhman says traditional fund managers just don't want to add crypto, but education and yield might change it quickly. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin and crypto seem to be on the verge of mainstream adoption, with US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) shattering inflow records, Goldman Sachs holding more crypto ETF shares issued by BlackRock than any other institution, and corporate treasuries from Strategy to Bitmine embracing digital assets. However, a recent survey from Bank of America showed three-quarters of global fund managers remain steadfast in their refusal to touch digital assets. According to Max Gokhman, deputy chief investment officer for Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, the paradoxical numbers aren’t due to regulatory uncertainty or operational complexity, as those barriers have largely been addressed. In an interview with CryptoSlate, Gokhman said the skewed numbers stem from fear, misconception, and the industry’s struggle with abandoning deeply held beliefs about what constitutes legitimate investment. Gokhman spent years watching traditional finance grapple with the digital asset revolution. He noted: “The biggest reason is it takes a while for an established industry to realize that they’re falling behind. There’s this fear of the unknown that exists.” Fund managers pride themselves on fiduciary responsibility, but this protective instinct has created a paradox: the desire to safeguard client assets prevents managers from accessing opportunities their clients increasingly demand. According to Gokhman: “Part of being a good steward is being aware of what your clients want. Clients from retail to institutional level are more interested in digital assets, but they’re finding that their investment managers are not actually there with solutions.” The resistance stems from persistent misconceptions. One notion is that it’s all hyper-speculative and lacks value, while the other is that there is a lack of staff with the expertise to create legitimate investment solutions using digital assets. When Gokhman encounters skeptical colleagues, the conversation follows a predictable script. Traditional finance stalwarts mention memecoins as representative of the entire crypto ecosystem, revealing what he called a surface-level understanding. Just as equity markets span from blue-chip dividends to speculative biotechs, digital assets range from established protocols generating real revenue to purely speculative tokens. His response has become automatic: “Because you invest in equities, does that mean you’re only buying pink sheet penny stocks? High-yield debt has plenty of companies that most rational investors wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole. Most asset managers will tell you they own emerging market equities and distressed debt. That’s a key asset class for them.” Gokhman stressed that the skepticism is selective. Managers are comfortable holding Venezuelan bonds, instruments that have defaulted multiple times, while balking at Bitcoin, which has never missed a payment in 15 years. While fund managers debate crypto’s legitimacy, the market has quietly transformed. The data Gokhman cited punctures the retail narrative: 89% of Bitcoin transactions on exchanges exceed $100,000. He highlighted: “That’s not retail money. The market is becoming more institutionalized.” Franklin Templeton’s response involves a three-tier campaign targeting central bankers, institutional intermediaries, and retail investors. The middle tier, which is crucial, consists of wirehouses and platform owners who control access to millions yet remain ignorant of client demand. Gokhman questions these players about whether they asked their clients if they wanted crypto. He adds: “They may have a Coinbase account where they have most of their wealth. You’re just not capturing that.” Traditional advisors often discover wealth sits fragmented across platforms, with professionally managed portfolios containing none of the digital assets clients accumulate independently. Franklin Templeton’s breakthrough lies in translation: expressing blockchain concepts in traditional finance language. When analyzing Solana, they don’t invoke revolutionary rhetoric but calculate discounted cash flows. Gokhman explained: “If you have something like Solana where actual fees are being paid on every transaction, we can project the growth of those transactions. Those are future cash flows. We can discount them back to the present.” The approach demystifies digital assets by applying familiar analytical frameworks that any investor with basic valuation training can understand. As Federal Reserve rate cuts approach, Gokhman sees opportunity. Traditional yield sources offer diminishing returns just as institutions face mounting pressure to generate income, and crypto can provide an alternative. According to him: “Everyone needs income. Staking is one clear way to do it. When people tell me about being worried about this [crypto] all being a scam, well, have you worried about the government just canceling all the debt? Because I’ve had that happen.” Recent SEC guidance on liquid staking represents a potential inflection point. For the first time, regulated products can offer staking yields without requiring direct crypto ownership. If crypto ETFs with staking enabled are approved, Gokhman predicts the resistance cannot persist indefinitely. He predicted: “When we can give the yield, I think it’s going to drive even more adoption.” The transformation will likely accelerate suddenly. Institutional adoption often follows the pattern of persisting skepticism until competitive pressure forces mass movement. The great crypto divide persists between the 75% of fund managers clinging to familiar frameworks and a growing coalition recognizing that client service requires embracing technological change. The question isn’t whether this divide will close, as economic pressure guarantees eventual adoption. The question is which managers will lead and which will scramble to catch up.

Title: Europe's Economy Is Stagnating as the U.S. Grows Richer. It Doesn't Have To Be This Way.

Economics Sam Bowman | From the October 2025 issue It's not hard to see why Europeans often feel a sense of superiority over Americans. No European city has an area as dangerous or decrepit as San Francisco's Tenderloin district. Some Americans obsess about Europe's supposedly no-go areas, but no European city has crime on par with places like Memphis, Tennessee, or St. Louis, Missouri. In 2023, more people were murdered in Chicago (population: 2.7 million) than in all of Italy (population: 59 million). When you ride New York's subways, it's best not to wear nice shoes in case you step in a pool of vomit. Our cities are not just vastly safer than America's: They're more beautiful, more vibrant with history and art and food. Europe has the Tuscan countryside, the Swiss Alps, Barcelona, Provence, the French Riviera, and the Balearic Islands, all inside an area smaller than Texas. Europe may be beautiful, but it has become a byword for economic malaise—a land of snooty Europoors who prostrate themselves before a disdainful President Donald Trump because they aren't sure they can defend themselves from Russian aggression. Most of us in Europe don't own ice makers. It can get very hot during our summers, but air conditioning is still a luxury across the continent. An American friend visiting my house in London was bewildered to see me hanging my clothes up to dry on a metal hanger in my hallway: Like most Europeans, I don't own a dryer. The average American could stop working in the first week of October and still will have earned more than the average Frenchman working until the end of the year. In Western Europe, GDP per capita—the average economic output per person—is about $63,000 per year, adjusted for the cost of living. In the United States, it is $86,000. Yes, Europeans work fewer hours and take more vacation. But that explains only part of the gap. For roughly two decades, Western Europe, home to the continent's largest economies, has stagnated. In 1995, its labor productivity—the value of goods and services produced per hour worked—was 95 percent of what it was in the United States, having risen from just 22 percent in 1945. By 2023, it was down to 80 percent. Ten years ago, 52 of the world's top 100 companies by market capitalization were American and 28 were European. Since then, the American total has grown to 58 while the European count has fallen to 18. The United States has produced five companies worth more than $2 trillion. At around $350 billion, Europe's largest company, the enterprise software provider SAP, is worth about as much as Home Depot. Many Europeans assume their lower incomes are the price they pay for ensuring their poorer countrymen have better living standards. But the median American household has a disposable income that is 16 percent higher than the median German household, adjusted for purchasing power. Only the poorest 10 percent of Americans do worse than their French, German, or Italian counterparts in terms of disposable income, which factors in taxes and welfare. What explains this gap between Europe and the U.S.? There are many factors, from rigid labor markets to energy restrictions to trade barriers to burdensome regulations on tech companies. The connecting thread is that Europe is poor because of specific policy choices. Europe is poor because it chose to be poor. Europe's most obvious failure is its tech sector. By nearly every measure it lags behind America's, in an era in which technological progress is one of the strongest drivers of material well-being. Yet rather than try to emulate America's relatively hands-off approach, which has given its entrepreneurs, inventors, and investors the freedom to build such companies as Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and Google, the European Union (E.U.) is known as a "regulatory superpower." In recent years, the E.U. has imposed expansive new regulations on data privacy, which enshrined in law the cookie banners that now litter the internet, and has plunged into the preemptive regulation of artificial intelligence, which its internal market commissioner claimed would allow European "startups and researchers to lead the global race for trustworthy AI." Europe has some of the highest electricity prices on Earth, thanks to environmental laws and an overreliance on imported gas—a huge problem when AI relies on power-hungry data centers. But never fear: Electronic devices in the E.U. must be fitted with a USB-C port, eliminating a grand total of 2 grams of waste per citizen per year. E.U. leaders insist this is actually America's fault. European officialdom spent much of the 2010s blaming its tech sector's sluggishness on unfair practices by American tech companies. One official even compared U.S. tech companies to a soccer team that trapped its opponents in their dressing room: "Someone has locked it and thrown away the key." Their answer, inevitably, was even more regulation. In 2022, the E.U. passed blockbuster legislation to regulate platforms like Google and Amazon. This, it said, would "create new opportunities for startups." It didn't work. Two months later, OpenAI, an American startup with no previous consumer products, launched ChatGPT. A few months after that, Anthropic and Google followed with their offerings. (Google's DeepMind is based in London, but Google bought it in 2014.) Here was a digital market where success could not reasonably be attributed to incumbency, yet European companies were still on the fringes. Europe has missed out on wave after wave of frontier technology not because of American mischief, but because the continent has allowed its labor markets, energy costs, trade policy, and capital markets to go awry. Belgium, home to the E.U.'s capital city of Brussels, is famous for having survived without a formal, permanent federal government. It went 652 days with an interim government until a new federal government was formed in 2020. A decade earlier, in 2010, it went 589 days before a government was finally formed. A caretaker administration sat in power during these periods, keeping the machinery of the state operating but unable to pass any new laws, spending, or tax reforms. Yet life went on. Belgians who got sick were still covered by the country's universal health insurance system. Belgians turning 65 still retired into a generous pension, pegged to whatever they had earned during their working lives. The trains kept running, and crime stayed low. Though the country was rocked by bank failures in 2008–2009 and the wider eurozone debt crisis that followed the Great Recession, life has not become radically different for ordinary people over these years. Taxes and government spending are slowly rising, and GDP growth was an anemic 0.6 percent per year from 2007 through 2023 (half of the rate in the U.S.). As in many European countries, issues like immigration and Islam got more attention than the country's underlying economic and political sclerosis. It may be tempting to conclude that Europeans are simply less culturally inclined toward economic dynamism and growth. Maybe a quiet life is all that Europeans really want. But this argument is unconvincing. There are, after all, plenty of European tech founders. They just live in America. One in 10 U.S. tech startups is founded by a European, and that share has risen over the past 10 years. It is also hard to square this argument with Europe's history. Brussels is less than half an hour from the cradle of modern capitalism. The old towns of Ghent and Bruges are nearly perfectly preserved from their late medieval heyday, when they were at the crossroads of Europe's wool and cloth trade. The world's first stock exchange still stands in Bruges. Nearby Antwerp was the capital of global trade and finance in the 16th century, when modern capitalism really started to flower. In the 19th century, Belgium industrialized earlier and faster than the United States, building powerful coal, iron, textile and railway industries, and leading the way out of poverty and hunger. Europe, historically, has had no shortage of entrepreneurs and capitalists. So why do companies struggle to innovate in Europe today? Pieter Garicano, author of the Silicon Continent newsletter, has suggested that what really separates European companies from American ones is Europe's high cost of business failure, rooted in its inflexible labor laws. Each country's rules are different. But they tend to protect workers from being fired, require union agreement for mass layoffs, and demand large payouts for those who do lose their jobs. These are more than just the cost of doing business. In markets where companies have to take risks, mass layoffs can be unavoidable. But in the United States, layoffs are usually quick and relatively low-cost; in the E.U., they can take months or even years. Turnover is thus much higher in America. About 1 percent of the U.S. work force is laid off every month, whereas in Germany, less than 0.1 percent is. That makes the cost of risk-taking much higher in Europe than in the United States. American companies can treat layoffs as a normal if regrettable part of the trial-and-error process. For European companies, the difficulty of shutting down company divisions when strategic bets turn out not to have paid off makes it much more costly to take those bets to begin with. For larger companies, this can make it far harder to change approach than their rivals elsewhere find it. Volkswagen, Europe's largest company by revenue, faces an enormous threat from inexpensive Chinese electric vehicles, yet its attempts to restructure were drawn out for more than a year by union objections to factory closures, which the company eventually gave in to. When SAP laid off 10,000 workers, it reportedly had to pay out three years' worth of salary to each of the European employees it wanted to let go. Smaller companies are often exempted from these rules. But that makes little difference, because every ambitious little startup hopes to one day become a big one, and plans accordingly. The prospect of being captured by these labor laws once they have grown puts them off from setting up in Europe. It also deters venture capital investors. Not every European state has such restrictive labor laws. Denmark, for example, pairs generous unemployment insurance with flexible rules about hiring and firing, a model known as "flexicurity." Sweden's are also much less rigid than those in most of Western Europe. These countries are among the richest in Europe. Denmark is one of the few European nations that approaches America's GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power, and it has one of the continent's highest levels of employment. These countries also punch well above their weight in high tech. Denmark's Novo Nordisk, which has pioneered the use of GLP-1 drugs to help with weight loss, has become one of Europe's biggest companies. Sweden's Spotify is one of Europe's only successful consumer technology platforms. Rigid labor market laws have another drawback. The more difficult it is to hire and fire workers, the harder immigrants tend to find it to assimilate into their new country's job market—and the more they resort to low-paid informal work that they can get through social and family connections. This reduces how much exposure they get to people from their new country's native population, which makes them less likely to adjust to, and adopt, the country's values. When combined with generous welfare benefits, that also makes it easier to keep women at home instead of working, which further limits cultural integration. More flexible labor market laws might not just add vitality to Europe's economies; they could help address one of the continent's biggest social problems. In 2003, energy prices in America and in Europe's largest economies were similar. But by 2021—before Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent European energy prices even higher—German industrial electricity prices were 156 percent of what American industrial users were paying. Spanish industrial customers were paying twice the American price. In 2021, Italian businesses, who have long faced high prices, paid four times as much for electricity as American ones. In Europe's largest economies, energy prices were nearly twice as high as American prices before the Ukraine war. The price of natural gas has shot up since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, driving energy costs even higher. One in 10 Europeans reported not being able to keep their homes warm enough during the winter of 2023. In 2022, when energy prices were at their highest, factories across the continent were forced to furlough their workers and pause production. But it is a mistake to blame Europe's energy problems solely on the war, as some do. Natural gas was cheap during the 2010s: lower in nominal terms in 2015 than it had been 10 years earlier, and falling even more by the end of the decade. But even as gas prices fell, electricity prices rose. The biggest reason is probably climate policy. European governments and the E.U. have committed the continent to an exceptionally demanding decarbonization schedule that runs far ahead of those of the United States or China. By 2030, European emissions must be at least 55 percent below where they were in 1990. National governments that do not act to bring this about can be prosecuted. Compare this to America, which merely seeks a nonbinding 50 percent to 52 percent reduction in emissions below its 2005 peak, which was higher than in 1990. China doesn't even plan for emissions to start falling until after 2030. Europe adopted a carbon pricing system in 2005. It now charges about six times more per ton of carbon than China does, and about 50 percent more than California. Most U.S. states do not price carbon emissions at all. From 2000 to 2020, European countries cut their coal use by more than half, and from 2010 to 2021 they shut down 80 gigawatts' worth of coal-fired power plants. Along with gas, most of the shortfall was made up by wind and solar, both of which are significantly subsidized by levies on energy bills. Many European states have responded to these high prices by subsidizing electricity for large users. As well as raising costs for other energy users, this has the effect of making it harder for smaller companies to compete with their larger rivals. Since such policies are unlikely to be sustainable for very long, they do little to keep these sectors going in the long run. The continued investment and entry they require depends on returns over a long time horizon. High energy costs have led to rolling sectoral recessions. A recent report into European competitiveness by former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi estimated that output in Europe's four largest energy-intensive sectors—chemicals, basic metals, minerals, and paper—has fallen by over 10 percent in the past four years, following the rise in gas prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It will cost half a trillion euros to decarbonize just these sectors. Decarbonizing shipping and aviation will cost a further 100 billion euros per year. Yet Europe's leaders have generally refused to accept that its green energy policies are this costly. Even the Draghi report, held by many to be the first serious attempt to acknowledge the continent's economic problems, claims that decarbonization is an opportunity "to take the lead in new clean technologies and circularity solutions." But Europe's eagerness to take the lead on decarbonization is the source of many of its troubles. If Europe's problems were limited to national policy errors, then in time you would expect economic activity to flow to islands of relative openness, such as Sweden and Denmark, just as bad policies in California and New York have driven people to Florida and Texas. That might even be how the E.U. is supposed to work. Its single market is often seen as the E.U.'s crowning achievement: a set of rules that are supposed to ensure the frictionless movement of goods, services, capital, and people across the borders of Europe's member states. But Luis Garicano, an economist and former member of European Parliament, argues that the single market has been left to decay—and sometimes has actually become a barrier to trade by adding new regulations on top of existing ones. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a sweeping law governing data use and privacy, is interpreted and enforced differently in each member state. In practice, this means that compliance with the law varies wildly across the bloc. Ireland, for example, approved Meta's data protection practices. But German and French GDPR regulators disagreed and levied fines of 390 million euros on the company. New antitrust powers introduced to govern Big Tech companies have been layered on top of national-level antitrust enforcement, creating multiple enforcers and contradictory sets of rules for the same conduct. This pattern repeats itself for every other flagship E.U. regulation, and is built into the design of the new AI Act. In total, the Union now has 270 different technology regulators. The Draghi report estimates the direct costs of rules being duplicated like this is some 200 billion euros per year. In other cases, the single market has simply been left unfinished. Professional qualifications, for example, are not recognized across European borders—when engineers based in Portugal win a contract for work in Germany, they face lengthy bureaucratic "equivalency checks" that stop them in practice from performing the work. National environmental regulations block products that are safely produced and used across the rest of the continent. Many important sectors, like finance and energy, are excluded from the single market altogether. The number of lawsuits brought against governments for single market infringements—the bread and butter of enforcing European free trade—has collapsed under the E.U.'s current leadership. Thierry Breton, who was internal market commissioner until last year, was supposed to work on breaking down these trade barriers but focused instead on fights with U.S. tech CEOs and stewarding the continent's AI regulations. This is hugely significant for Europe's economy. Trade within the E.U. is vast, and making it even slightly easier could have enormous benefits. The International Monetary Fund estimates that barriers to trade within the E.U. are equivalent to a 44 percent tariff on goods and a 110 percent tariff on services. According to Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief economist of the French bank BNP Paribas, "it would only take a 2.4 per cent increase in intra-EU trade to make up for a 20 per cent fall in exports to the US." This might also be a reason Europe's tech companies have struggled: Unlike their American or Chinese rivals, they do not have a large domestic market to sell into. The solution is simple. Rather than trying to harmonize regulations with a single rule book written in Brussels, trust that rules that are good enough for Swedish consumers are acceptable for Spanish ones too. If something is legal in one European country, you should be able to trade it and use it in all the others, provided it is clear where it comes from. "Mutual recognition" of this kind was supposed to be the basis of the single market. Restoring it would be one of the biggest trade liberalizations in world history. For all of Europe's longrunning economic problems, it was only after the Great Recession that the continent's economy really began to flatline. Meanwhile, America's recovered and continued to grow. What accounts for this sharp difference in performance? Tyler Goodspeed, former acting chair of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers, points to the Basel III financial regulations, global rules set out after the 2008 financial crisis. These were intended to reduce the risk of a future financial crisis by curbing lending to businesses and requiring banks to hold more "safe" assets. Whether these measures actually increase financial stability is questionable, given that earlier iterations required banks to hold more mortgage debt than they wanted. With the Great Recession, that came to look like a mistake. Though the postcrisis Basel rules were adopted in the United States as well, their effect in Europe may have been particularly chilling for business lending. There are two reasons for that. One: Europe's banking system is much more consolidated than America's. The United States has thousands of smaller banks, which escape many of the strictest rules. European countries tend to be dominated by only a handful of much larger institutions. Two: Europe's businesses are far more dependent on bank lending for financing than America's are. In Europe, 68 percent of business financing comes from banks, compared to just 20 percent in the United States. America's much larger venture capital, private equity, and pension fund investors make restrictions on bank lending much less important than in Europe. Debt financing generally favors capital-intensive businesses, such as Sweden's H2 Green Steel, which raised 4.2 billion euros in debt last year to finance a hydrogen-fired steel mill. Software-based companies, which have little collateral to borrow against, tend to find it harder to get loans this way. This isn't a problem in Silicon Valley, which has access to America's $1.25 trillion in venture capital. If Goodspeed is right, Basel's tighter rules on lending could be a big reason that European startups have struggled to grow compared to their American peers. Fixing the problem need not mean adding more risk to European finance: Removing barriers to the sort of investments that American companies can access could be the answer. There are islands of success across the continent. The Dutch company ASML is the world's only manufacturer of the photolithography machines needed to make advanced semiconductors. European companies do well in sectors such as luxury fashion, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and tourism. Many of the most celebrated video games of recent years, from Baldur's Gate 3 to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, were developed in Europe. Soccer is the world's favorite sport, and Europe's teams and leagues dominate it. These are not sectors that win wars or excite advocates of industrial policy. But they are profitable, and they make our world better. Though their economies are relatively small, the E.U.'s postcommunist members have grown impressively since joining the bloc in the early 2000s. Poland and Hungary's GDPs per capita have more than doubled in real terms since 2000, though Hungary has stagnated in recent years. In Romania it has nearly tripled, though from a lower level after enduring a particularly evil and destructive communist regime. These states have their problems, but they also tend to be clearer-eyed about the need for economic dynamism than Western Europeans. The world needs a rich, prosperous Europe. For all the region's failings, private property rights and the rule of law are more strongly protected and cherished in Europe than in most states around the world. Those values are incredibly difficult to build where they do not exist. Compared to that, fixing a few of the most important elements of a continent's economic policy should be easy. Shifting Europeans away from Franco-German-style labor laws sounds impossible, but few Europeans fear the thought of being a bit more like Denmark. Combining decarbonization with energy abundance will become easier as nuclear, solar, and battery power get cheaper. Revitalizing the single market is a career-making project for an ambitious reformer. Less onerous financial regulation can be implemented without major political costs, especially when it means removing barriers to investment approaches that have worked well in America. Those changes won't repair all of Europe's problems—its welfare states, for example, would still need a significant overhaul to be solvent—but they could set the stage for further reforms. Bringing this complacent continent back to reality will not be easy, but it can be done. Europe chose to be poor. But that also means it can choose not to be.

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor It’s been a long wait but Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell energized stocks today as he cracked open the door to a possible interest rate cut at the Central Bank’s September meeting. In his keynote address at the Fed’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Powell said that “the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” The Fed hasn’t cut rates since December of 2024. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 800 points or 1.9% to close at a record. The S&P 500 gained 1.5% and the 1.9%. It was an upbeat finale to a dour week rattled by AI jitters that pounded tech stocks. They rallied today along with media. Warner Bros. Discovery rose 4%. Disney and Comcast closed up 2%.

Paramount Skydance slipped as well after a massive run-up approaching meme stock status over the past few weeks. Deadline reported this afternoon that the newly merged company is planning thousands of layoffs. Watch on Deadline Exhibitors rose nicely led by AMC and Imax. Broadcasters posted gains amid M&A as Nexstar (up 1%) bid to acquire Tegna (flat). Charter, in the process of buying Cox, was up 4%. Amazon, Apple and Meta rose. Roku gained as shares from Sirius to Snap to Fubo. The Fed’s dual mandate is price stability and maximum employment. That’s been a major challenge as inflation went wild post-Covid and it took rate hike after hike to wrestle down toward the central bank’s traditional 2% benchmark. Powell said inflation risk is still “tilted to the upside” with tariff related price impacts now “clearly visible.” “We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem,” he said. However, the labor market is seeing “a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” he said. He called it an unusual situation which “suggests that downside risks to employment are rising” and that “the balance of risks appears to be shifting.” There’s been a lot of noise around U.S. economic indicators. President Donald Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner late last month after the agency reported that job growth in the U.S. had slowed to a near halt. The president also wants lower interest rates and has publicly lambasted Powell, frequently threatening to eject the chairman before his term ends next spring. Markets don’t react well when he does that so he’s always backed down. Trump is, however, calling for the resignation of Fed Board of Governors member Lisa Cook. Trump loyalist Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said his office found that she appeared to have falsified bank documents to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage — a controversy that is hanging over the Jackson Hole event.

Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=162780&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Title: Trump Says Intel Will Give 10% Stake To U.S., Becoming Third-Largest Shareholder
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/08/22/trump-says-intel-will-give-10-stake-to-us-becoming-third-largest-shareholder/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T20:01:23Z
Full Content:
ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump on Friday said Intel agreed to give the U.S. a 10% stake in the company, making the U.S. the beleaguered chipmaker’s third-largest shareholder in one of the largest government interventions in an American company in more than a decade. Trump said the agreement, representing a 10% stake work roughly $10 billion, resulted from his meeting with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan last week, telling reporters Friday, “I said, ‘I think it would be good having the United States as your partner.’” The deal will likely require approval from Intel’s board of directors. A 10% stake would represent the third-largest institutional holding in Intel, behind 13% stakes held by Blackrock and Vanguard. An agreement—expected to be formally announced later Friday—would boost Intel, which has been “left behind” its competitors in the chipmaking industry, Trump said. Shares of Intel rose more than 6% to just below $24 after Trump announced the agreement. Earlier this month, Trump called Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and said he should resign “immediately,” after Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Intel’s board over his alleged ties to Chinese firms. Cotton asked whether Tan divested from Chinese companies linked to the Chinese military or Communist Party, and whether Intel’s board was aware of a criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan served as CEO before being hired at Intel in March. Tan disputed the claims in a memo to Intel employees, writing there was “a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles” and arguing he has “always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.” Trump’s opinion on Tan changed after meeting in the White House last week, when Trump lauded Tan as “an amazing story.” A 10% stake would rank the U.S. just above SoftBank, which announced earlier this week it would invest $2 billion in Intel as part of both firms “investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation” in the U.S. The investment represents a roughly 2% stake, ranking SoftBank the fifth-largest shareholder of Intel. An investment by the U.S. in Intel developed over the last week, as Trump administration officials reportedly discussed converting grants under the CHIPS Act into an equity stake. Such a partial ownership in a U.S.-based company is historically rare, though the federal government previously injected billions of funds into Chrysler and General Motors to help restore the auto industry after the 2008 financial crisis. In the early 20th century, the U.S. provided financial support through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which was created by President Franklin Roosevelt to stabilize struggling banks, railroads and other firms during the Great Depression. The Treasury Department also provided loans through the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the U.S. took up rights to buy stock in airlines like Delta, United and Southwest.

Title: One in three Bitcoin treasuries slip below value as ‘spiral of doom’ fears grow
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/spiral-of-doom-as-one-in-three-treasury-companies-lose-premiums/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T19:43:47Z

About us Copy link Bitcoin treasury companies are in trouble. Their idea was simple: buy Bitcoin, package it in a corporate wrapper, and watch traders pay a premium for the shares. Then issue more stock. Rinse and repeat. On paper, it’s a perpetual money printer. The problem? One in three of the 156 publicly listed crypto treasury firms tracked by Capriole Investments now trade below a market net asset value, or mNAV, multiple of one. That means investors value these businesses for less than what their Bitcoin’s worth. Others put that figure at one in seven. And the gap is expected to widen. “There are structural reasons that suggest we may continue to see mNAVs dropping for some treasury companies,” Carlos Guzmán, VP of research at GSR, told DL News. That could force many companies to indiscriminately sell Bitcoin to pay the debt used to buy it. In turn, that could create a negative feedback loop of selling pressure that drags down share and crypto prices, Coinbase warned in a June report, suggesting that crypto treasury companies posed systemic risks. Most treasury firms can’t maintain the aggressive accumulation needed to justify a premium, Bitcoin analyst James Check argued in a June newsletter. As mNAVs inevitably drift towards one, the window to issue shares at a premium — and convert the proceeds into more Bitcoin — shrinks. Add operating costs, dilution, inconsistent buys, and investor fatigue toward strategies that aren’t all-in on buying Bitcoin, and underperformance becomes more likely, Check said. The whole pitch of a Bitcoin treasury is to do what Strategy did: turn a stash of coins into a stock that trades at a premium. That still holds true for Strategy, which commands a 34% premium to its more than $71 billion Bitcoin hoard, due to its years-long effort to build credibility with shareholders and scale the idea into one of crypto’s hottest trends. Yet, many firms are failing to copy the strategy. The sector’s average mNAV has been declining since May, Blockworks data shows. Despite the bull market, the list of sub-one mNAV companies is growing — a sign investors are getting pickier about which firms deserve a premium. NAV cuts both ways: if demand for a company’s shares falls, the price can drop below the value of the assets it holds, creating a discount. Crypto firms are no strangers to this. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust once traded at a 50% discount. Even after it converted into a spot exchange-traded fund, which narrowed the gap, billions flowed to cheaper rivals provided by BlackRock and Fidelity. A sub-one mNAV doesn’t automatically mean undervalued. Bulls see opportunity, while bears see justified scepticism and risk. But the days when any corporate Bitcoin wallet could command a premium may be over. Indeed, share prices have been struggling despite Bitcoin’s rally, suggesting they’ve decoupled from the underlying assets. Strategy is down 20% over the past month. Jack Mallers’ Twenty One Capital has shed 16% and Metaplanet has dropped 33% over the past 30 days. Other players, like Semler Scientific, have lost more than half their share price value from their late December peak. Even KULR Technology — an early adopter compared to the 2025 rush — has seen its shares plummet as much as 87%. None of those firms responded to requests for comment. This shouldn’t be happening. Bitcoin’s August all-time high above $124,000 should’ve lifted these stocks in theory. One reason behind the dip is that most newcomers lack Strategy Chair Michael Saylor’s leverage, investor base, and track record, said Check. For them, a sub-one mNAV means increased debt loads, dilution risk, and credibility issues that are dragging valuations lower. That’s a problem as many of Bitcoin treasuries have little beyond their crypto stash, according to legendary short-seller Jim Chanos. Some have even abandoned their core businesses to go all-in on crypto. The market may also lack confidence in unproven leadership, Guzmán said. Newer digital asset firms may also struggle to maintain investor interest. “Attention tends to focus on a limited number of high-quality, successful teams,” Guzmán added. “That makes it harder for the long tail of digital asset treasuries to trade at a premium, and may cause them to slide into discount territory in bearish market conditions.” The mix of weak management, dilution risk, and limited brand recognition could spell disaster. Take Strategy. On Monday, the company changed its dilution rules, prompting former Goldman Sachs analyst Dom Kwok to warn of a “spiral of doom.” If the firm is forced to sell shares at thinner premiums just to stay afloat, shareholder value gets eroded, interest costs mount, and Strategy could be forced to offload Bitcoin to cover its obligations, said Kwok. Strategy did not reply to a request for comment from DL News. Still, not everyone thinks a market-wide collapse is inevitable. André Dragosch, European head of research at Bitwise, told DL News that the dangers are overblown. “The risks are relatively limited,” he said. He added that some Strategy copycats might struggle because of their higher cost basis, lack a proper understanding of the asset, execution, and communication strategy. Even so, Dragosch said leveraged purchases act as a flywheel that amplifies both upside and downside volatility. He believes most mNAV discounts are due to Bitcoin’s price action, not fundamental problems. “I personally don’t think that we will see an increasing number of mNAV discounts over the medium to long term,” he said. Still, the appetite for accumulation hasn’t vanished. “It’s clear the market is keen to have crypto treasury companies accumulate more assets,” Spencer Yang, managing partner at BlockSpaceForce, told DL News. “But I’d love to see these companies add even more value to the crypto ecosystem beyond asset accumulation.” Pedro Solimano is DL News’ Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent.

FOX Business' Gerri Willis has the details on the investment strategy on 'Varney & Co.' Nearly $4 billion of new money flowed into digital assets last week, with the U.S. dominating 99% of the total haul. Investors are taking a cue from President Trump’s push to open retirement accounts up to alternative assets. "My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers’ retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement," a portion of a Trump executive order, "Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors," signed in early August, said. Ethereum illustration (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images / Getty Images) Ethereum ETPs (exchange-traded products), which give investors exposure to the crypto without holding it, attracted $2.87 billion in new assets last week, bringing the year-to-date inflows to a record $11 billion, as tracked by CoinShares. TRUMP'S 401(k) EXPANSION: WHAT TO KNOW Ethereum got an extra boost Friday, nearing the $4,800 level after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled a possible interest rate cut as early as September. It last hit a record $4,865.81 in November 2021. Ethereum commemorative coins and the interface of ethereum stocks displayed on a smartphone (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images / Getty Images) BlackRock's ETF arm, iShares, dominated the action, led by inflows into the Ethereum Trust ETF and its Bitcoin Trust ETF. BlackRock offices in New York City (Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images / Getty Images) Bitcoin, which is taking a backseat to ethereum, saw a $552 million boost, reversing two straight weeks of outflows. The largest cryptocurrency by market value is hovering around the $116,000 level, up 20% year-to-date but down from its record high of $124,495.51 reached on Aug. 14. WINKELVOSS TWINS DROP MILLIONS OF BITCOIN IN PRO-TRUMP PAC Smaller cryptos, including Solana and XRP, saw inflows of $176.5 million and $125 million, respectively. BLUE COLLAR BOOM PRIORITY OF TRUMP ADMINISTRATION Along with iShares, ProShares, Fidelity, 21Shares AG and Bitwise Funds Trust are leading annual inflows, CoinShares reported.

Title: Claude AI For Retirement Investing: Project Your Future And Analyze Accounts

ByNicolas Straut, Contributor. Retirement planning is a challenge for many Americans, requiring deep reading, organization of tools, selection of the right accounts and investments and ongoing management. With the rise of AI, including Claude by Anthropic, one of the most advanced AI tools on the market, retirement planning is experiencing a shakeup as more investors look to AI to answer their investing questions, optimize their portfolios and set a financial plan for the future. This article will investigate the promise and reality of Claude AI for retirement investing, including how to use it for planning, analyzing your holdings and assisting you with investing. It will also help you understand the limits of Claude’s capabilities. Retirement planning has traditionally operated by investors either managing their own retirement planning with an array of tools like spreadsheets or software, or by investors delegating planning to financial advisors to manage investing for them. AI is disrupting this process by providing more analysis and ideas, all through a simple chat interface, or by allowing investors to build their own tools within AI tools with just simple writing. AI can provide insights, run data, predict risk and provide alternate retirement strategies to investors for free. Many investors simply want to leave retirement planning to a professional who can manage day-to-day investing, choose tax-optimized strategies and give peace of mind that an expert is at the helm, all for a fee. For do-it-yourself investors or those who may not have been so bold previously, AI can provide personalized recommendations, tell investors what they’re missing and assist with investment decisions as a retirement planning partner. As AI increasingly integrates within a growing number of people’s personal and professional workflows, using it for retirement planning is becoming an essential new tool in the investment stack. Claude is a popular AI assistant helping individuals and teams code, solve problems, write and search more intelligently. It is also being used as an investing assistant, providing answers to a host of money questions from “What are the best AI stocks for 2025?” to “Which retirement account should I contribute to first?” With so many AI tools on the market, it’s important to know the strengths, weaknesses and features of each, including Claude AI. Claude AI is a large language model (LLM) created by Anthropic, a company composed of many former ChatGPT engineers, designed to provide a safe and accurate AI experience to users. With guardrails for safety as well as a powerful engine built by some of the best AI creators, Claude has many use cases from software creation to retirement planning assistance. Claude, like other LLMs, personalizes the conversation with its users, helping it to provide ideal answers, better understand your context and deliver a superior experience, whether you’re asking for retirement tips or writing an important email to a coworker. Claude is disrupting retirement investing, as it is with other work like software engineering, by serving as a partner and workhorse on tasks you need done. This LLM can help investors understand how to optimize their portfolio, recommend investments, run analyses on prospective investments and help you make effective decisions based on your long-term plan. It can also serve as a partner in educating you on potential risky investments, dissuade you from making a poor decision like selling during a crash and build you a full retirement plan that adjusts over time. A smart use case of LLMs like Claude is estimating how your portfolio may perform in the future based on scenarios and variables like contributions. Claude will offer potential scenarios and ask questions to gauge your long-term needs and how your portfolio can support them. By setting goals, checking out scenarios and gauging variables that could affect performance with Claude, you can be better prepared for retirement. Whether you’re planning to retire early, work a side job in retirement, plan to have additional dependents or just need help knowing how to spend your money, Claude can help you set retirement goals. The LLM can ask you questions to let you know all the variables you’ll need to spend money on, help you set savings targets and let you know if there are any variables you’re not considering. Claude can also surface risks you didn’t even consider or potential options to let your portfolio last longer, like an ideal state to live in or government benefits to apply for. Claude and other LLMs love running scenarios and helping you understand all the possibilities — even those you didn’t consider for your portfolio. For example, you might consider your portfolio and retirement plan to be conservative but it could share a bear-case scenario where you might not have enough to retire. Claude can also provide suggestions to make your plan more fool-proof and the steps you need to take to make your retirement successful. Retirement calculators have popularized the ability to visualize how even minor changes to your investing journey can make a difference. Likewise Claude can help you understand how a potential portfolio may look if you invest more when you’re young or how much in contributions it would take if you start late. It can also provide suggestions on how to optimize your retirement contributions and how to ensure you save more as you earn more without succumbing to lifestyle creep. An excellent use case of Claude AI is granularly considering your portfolios’ makeup, providing useful suggestions about where you’re taking too much risk or holding onto an asset which may continue to drag down your performance. By feeding it statements or portfolio makeup, it can weigh it based on your age, time to retirement and other important details. Optimization recommendations from Claude can be based on consensus wisdom, its own fundamental analysis and the latest literature on retirement planning. A Claude analysis of your retirement accounts can tell you where you should contribute more to your 401(k), traditional IRA or Roth IRA. For example, if you live and work in a high-tax state but plan to retire in a low-tax state, it may recommend investing more in a traditional 401(k) or IRA over a Roth. It can also make recommendations like investing more in IRAs if your 401(k) fund options are high-fee, or more in a 401(k) if your company offers a high match. When analyzing your portfolio, Claude can also analyze your holdings to see if any of funds or ETFs are high-fee and should be substituted out. By simply feeding in your portfolio and asking for optimization offerings based on your goals and life plans, it can provide useful suggestions. If you’re overindexed in a particular sector, it could provide rebalancing recommendations; if you’re not taking sufficient risk for your age, it could suggest lowering exposure to bonds. Claude can also flag where you’re invested in low performers, like a sector ETF or stock that should be sold for more broad exposure or a new growth opportunity. LLMs are excellent at this sort of analysis and can highlight where your money could be working more efficiently. By utilizing LLMs, you can be told the real cost of holding on to dead weight assets, and be recommended for better opportunities for your retirement. Another core strength of Claude is recommending ideal asset allocations based on your timeline or ability to bear risk. For example, if it knows you’re young with many years to invest and grow your holdings, it could recommend a more equity heavy portfolio or taking on growth stocks in a percentage of your portfolio for massive upside. It can also recommend less risky assets or the best possible opportunities for income generation if you’re in or approaching retirement. Claude AI can provide a range of benefits for retirement planning, from lightning quick analysis of data and deep research into particular stocks and analyst ratings, to cold, unemotional perspectives on certain situations. As mentioned, Claude is excellent at running numbers, making it ideal to analyze disclosures, statements and fundamentals of stocks. It can also provide advice on particular situations. For example, if you’re considering using margin to invest in a risky asset, it can provide you with advice on whether this could be successful based on previous performance, analysts’ perceptions of this asset and percentage chance of failure. Often LLMs will caveat advice and will readily provide different scenarios where a strategy could or could not be successful, within seconds. Instead of spending hours on research and calculations, Claude can run a simulation of financial scenarios quickly, read and explain reports very quickly and is always available to assist you with your questions. For investors who have a grounding in investing concepts and know-how managing a portfolio, Claude is a fantastic partner. LLMs are highly time efficient and can be asked to run new analyses and projections even when you’re not interacting with them, updating you on new developments and providing helpful suggestions. Investing can be a highly emotional activity, as you’re risking your hard-earned money to earn a return, be prepared for retirement and beat inflation. LLMs like Claude can soberly tell you if you’re making a foolish mistake, grounded in probability and against hard research from multiple sources. Just as a financial advisor can keep you grounded in not selling too quickly or trusting an unvetted source, so too can Claude provide unemotional advice to prevent you from making an unnecessary mistake. While Claude is an exceptionally powerful tool, it can’t replace the professional expertise of a financial advisor who is licensed and knows your financial situation. When using it as a non-professional, you may provide inaccurate information, not provide essential information or the tool may make mistakes that might affect the actions it recommends. In addition, issues still persist with AI platforms, like inappropriate use of data or poor predictions based on old or incomplete financial data. One limitation to using Claude for retirement investing over a licensed financial advisor or your own spreadsheets is potential concerns over data privacy and security. Data breaches can occur on less secure platforms, or if you’re using Claude over an unsafe network. There hasn’t been a data breach on a major AI platform like Claude yet, but concerns remain over how these platforms may utilize information or if it could pass data to a different user through its memory. Another limitation is that while AI is highly intelligent, markets can still behave irrationally and Claude and other LLMs cannot predict the future. A pandemic or geopolitical crisis could throw a particular market into chaos, breaking previous trends an LLM conservatively thinks may continue, or affect an asset class considered otherwise safe. Predictions of LLMs should be considered as suggestions and not perfect, just as you would be cautious with financial advice from anyone else. While LLMs like Claude can base their predictions or analysis on data sets and consensus views, they’re not licensed professionals equipped to fully manage your portfolio. A financial advisor must pass exams and be deemed worthy of managing portfolios by licensing entities, which brings understanding of regulations, client relationships and complicated situations. By utilizing an LLM alongside a financial advisor, you can get the best of both worlds of retirement planning: human expertise as well as an LLM’s suggestions for questions and insights for a segment of your portfolio. AI will likely disrupt retirement planning into the future, as the models become more intelligent and widely used, gain access to more data and are more broadly marketed to investors. In the short-term, AI will be used more widely for investing questions and helping with portfolio analysis and recommendations. It is and will continue to be used for scenario planning, like knowing where to invest based on short and long-term goals, based on factors like your salary, current portfolio and future retirement plans. In the long-term, AI will be more broadly adopted by financial firms and analysts as the models are packaged by firms for their teams’ use, serving as junior analysts and useful tools for financial advisors. This will be helpful for gauging optimal portfolios for each of their clients’ unique needs and situations. With time, AI may become intelligent and competent enough to fully replace financial advisors, using inputs and having sufficient regulatory support to manage portfolios. Bottom Line As one of the most advanced models, Claude has tremendous promise for helping you with your retirement planning, whether you need to find opportunities for a higher return, optimize for tax efficiency or just reduce emotional decision making. While Claude isn’t yet a replacement for financial advisors, it’s making it easy for self-starters to improve their retirement planning as a financial planning partner, and improving the ways in which investors can work with a human advisor. Through personalization, deep research capabilities and thoughtful prompting, Claude is an excellent tool for investors to better prepare for their financial future. Can Claude AI Replace A Financial Advisor For Retirement Planning? No, Claude AI can’t replace a financial advisor for retirement planning, but it can provide intelligent suggestions and insights, improving your retirement planning when paired with a professional financial advisor. Is My Financial Data Safe When Using Claude AI? Claude AI prides itself on AI safety and is considered a secure platform, but you should always be careful with providing confidential financial data through LLMs and carefully read data policies of the AI platforms you use. Does Claude AI Work with All Retirement Accounts? Claude AI can analyze documents and data you feed it from retirement accounts, but doesn’t yet offer direct connection to retirement accounts. How Often Should I Update My Plan With Claude AI? If you’ve developed a retirement plan with ClaudeAI, you should update it at least once a year to provide updated information on investment performance, life changes or changed plans to optimize your plan.

Title: Bitcoin Whales Quietly Stack 16,000 BTC During Downtrend

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Reports from CryptoQuant suggest that large holders are moving aggressively while smaller players are bailing out. Over the past week, wallets linked to key Bitcoin participants grabbed more than 16,000 BTC during a price decline. At the same time, retail investors have been selling into weakness, taking losses and widening the gap between whales and small traders. Analysts see this as a possible clue that the market could be forming a local bottom. The timing of these moves adds more complexity. September is rarely kind to markets. Data over the last 35 years shows the S&P 500 slipping an average of 1% during this month, and Bitcoin has often mirrored that seasonal drag. Now, throw in a Federal Reserve meeting on September 15-16, where traders assign an 80% chance to a 0.25% rate cut, and you have a cocktail of uncertainty. For some, a cut signals potential relief for risk assets. For others, the historic pattern overshadows any short-term optimism. Either way, volatility seems unavoidable. Amid this macro backdrop, a single transaction set off alarms. BlackRock shifted over 10,584 BTC—valued close to $1.20 billion—to Coinbase in one day. That kind of move rarely goes unnoticed. Transfers to exchanges often imply a readiness to sell, and the market responded immediately. Bitcoin slid to a little over $112,000, a level that previously acted as the launchpad for the rally that pushed prices to the all-time high of $124,000 this August. Traders are now watching that number like hawks, questioning if it can act as a safety net once more. Technical signals, however, don’t tell a unified story. The relative strength index sits at 32.90, scraping the oversold zone, which can sometimes hint at an exhausted sell-off. But the MACD is still weak, with its line staying under the signal mark, suggesting negative momentum. This split in indicators keeps traders guessing whether the next big move will be up or down. If $112,000 holds, a rebound is on the table. Break it, and the downside could accelerate, especially if institutions start unloading more Bitcoin. Add whale accumulation, seasonal weakness, and a looming Fed decision, and the short-term outlook looks less like a straight line and more like a curve with surprises waiting around the bend. For now, the battle is clear. It’s between confidence and fear, and the outcome may depend on what happens before this month closes.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Lucid Group (LCID) said it will proceed with plans for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, as the unprofitable EV startup looks to boost its share price. In a reverse stock split, a company cuts the number of its outstanding shares and increases the per-share price proportionally. Lucid said the number of authorized shares of common stock will be reduced to 1.5 billion from 15 billion following the reverse split, with the shares set to start trading on an adjusted basis on Sept. 2. Lucid shares were little changed in recent trading and have lost more than 30% of their value this year amid worries about its outlook and the anticipated phaseout of EV tax credits under the "One Big Beautiful Bill" signed into law by President Trump in July. Earlier this month, Lucid reduced its 2025 production guidance to between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles for 2025, from 20,000 previously. The EV company last month launched a partnership with Uber Technologies (UBER) and self-driving software maker Nuro aimed at developing robotaxis and bringing them to Uber's network.

Title: AI dominates 2025 Future of Memory and Storage conference

Getty Images/iStockphoto How will today's AI boom affect storage and new technologies? Earlier this month, the Future of Memory and Storage conference, formerly Flash Memory Summit, sought to address those questions. For the most part, the different nature of AI workloads combined with the significant size of the market creates needs for new ways of moving data between processing and memory. Here's a look at presenters' descriptions of AI's importance to the storage market and some of the technologies that could accommodate the shift from conventional to AI workloads. More than 200 speakers gathered in Santa Clara, Calif., at the Future of Memory and Storage. To set the stage, many presenters showed their versions of a chart dramatizing hyperscale data centers' enormous spending on AI hardware, similar to the one below. Some estimate that AI spending could surpass $4 trillion by 2030. The most recent quarter's spend was $99 billion, indicating that 2025 annual spending should exceed $400 billion. Nearly everyone highlighted the power requirements of such systems and the difficult effect they might have on the grid. Some even spoke of small nuclear power plants that certain hyperscalers are said to consider as an alternative to purchasing energy from established firms. But something that seems to be widely overlooked is the sustainability of this level of spending. In a presentation of my own, I reasoned that it's perfectly justifiable for spending to increase as long as revenue increases justify that move. However, I then illustrated that hyperscaler spending for six leading firms -- Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft Azure -- has risen from a relatively steady 12% to 14% of revenue to roughly double that at 25% of revenue in the most recently reported quarter. It's hard to imagine that this pace can be offset by today's layoffs of engineers whose jobs are to be replaced by AI. It's more reasonable to expect to see a cooling-off period soon where these companies ease back on capital spending, which is likely to lead to a downturn in the storage and chip businesses. Typically, all these companies tend to increase or decrease capital spending together, leading to relatively serious supply and demand mismatches when they do. Vendors revealed many new technologies at the Future of Memory and Storage show because AI manages data differently than conventional workloads. Nearly every SSD maker either demonstrated or disclosed 100 TB and larger SSDs. Samsung presented a behemoth of greater than 200 TB, and Sandisk promised a 512 TB SSD in 2027. Many of these SSDs will ship in the new E1.L "ruler" form factor for reasons of both capacity and heat dissipation. The motivation behind these monster SSDs is that Meta published their finding that performance could be improved by inserting a new layer of QLC SSDs between their TLC SSDs and their HDDs. It's somewhat ironic that this new layer will have a lower total capacity than the HDD layer but will be made from SSDs whose individual capacity will be an order of magnitude larger than the HDDs they cache. Other vendors at the Future of Memory and Storage showed unique approaches to AI. Two that I found particularly interesting were Solidigm's new approach to a hot-swappable liquid-cooled SSD and Phison's SSD designed specifically to reduce cost for large language model (LLM) systems. Users can insert Solidigm's SSD into a front-panel slot, just like its air-cooled counterpart, using a special third-party rack that presses liquid-cooled plates against the SSDs. The SSDs are designed to take as much advantage as possible by incorporating internal heat management that balances the heat dissipation between the front and back of the SSD. The Phison Pascari SSD has been designed for an extraordinarily heavy write load, boasting endurance of 100 drive writes per day. AI training workloads are very write-intensive. Phison's engineers reasoned that GPU performance scales with memory size, meaning high-bandwidth memory (HBM) DRAM, and proper management of this memory along with the use of cheaper NAND flash, can support large models with a lower number of GPUs than normal. Phison's combined hardware and software approach to this problem, dubbed "aiDAPTIV+," allows a single GPU to support LLMs at a somewhat slower performance than a multiple-GPU system at a significantly lower cost. A couple of companies also shared plans to introduce high-performance AI-specific SSDs boasting 100 million IOPS throughputs. Some questioning revealed that this target, apparently presented to them by their hyperscale customers, was not the standard 4K IOPS that is normally used to compare today's SSDs against one another. Instead, since AI deals with smaller data granularity, the new AI-specific SSDs will feed GPUs with 100 million 512-byte IOPS, which would presumably be easier to achieve within a given I/O bandwidth. Note that I didn't say that it would be easy, just easier than supplying 100 million 4K IOPS. The leading SSD suppliers are accepting the challenge, though, which implies that they expect to achieve that goal in production volumes. Sandisk illustrated a different approach to the size and cost challenges posed by HBM. The company is working on a new high-bandwidth flash (HBF), which should replace some, but not all, of the DRAM-based HBM stacks within a GPU complex. While today's NAND chips are optimized for cost, HBF will be optimized for read bandwidth. It will still have a decided cost advantage over DRAM, with a similar read bandwidth. The laws of physics prevent write bandwidth from improving, so HBF will be a good platform for inference but not for training, because training has a relatively balanced number of HBM reads and writes, while inference is read-intensive. In a February investor conference, when this technology was first disclosed, Sandisk shared the image below. Although the diagram on the right of the image indicates that a single HBF NAND die should behave like 16 individual chips, Sandisk representatives told me that they weren't disclosing what the actual number might be. The company did share that their models show the performance of a GPU with an unlimited amount of HBF NAND flash came within about 3% of the performance of a similar GPU with an unlimited amount of DRAM-based HBM. In the long run, new technologies will fuel today's amazing AI growth and a pipeline of new ideas will help improve AI in the future. All the industry needs to do now is deliver those offerings and protect itself from any pause in AI spending that might happen in coming quarters. Expect to see these technologies in the future, either sooner, as long as AI spending keeps up, or later, should there be a correction.

Title: Tariff Shock And Reversal: Finding Value In Industrial Leaders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbuckingham/2025/08/22/tariff-shock-and-reversal-finding-value-in-industrial-leaders/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T16:06:04Z

ByJohn Buckingham, Contributor. In my last column I wrote about how volatility is the price of admission for long-term wealth creation. Policy shakeups were the predominant reason for the volatility in the first half of 2025. In April, President Trump declared “Liberation Day” for trade, unveiling sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every major U.S. trading partner. Markets recoiled. The S&P 500 dropped more than 12% in a week, while Value and Growth stocks alike fell sharply. I often like to point investors to Lao Tzu’s quote that says, “If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading." Faced with political and business backlash, the administration rolled back or delayed several of its harshest provisions, and stocks moved toward recovery. By June’s end the S&P had rebounded 25% from the April lows. Tariff costs are real and can weigh on profits, but companies with strong competitive advantages usually find ways to adapt. Also, the volatility created by policy shocks often resets valuations and creates opportunity for disciplined buyers. I think the experiences for Deere, Caterpillar and Eaton all illustrate these points. Deere (DE) absorbed a $200 million tariff hit in its fiscal Q3 and expects $600 million in costs for the year. Large Agriculture sales fell 16%, yet management still projects net income in the range of $4.75 to $5.25 billion this year. Deere’s ability to proactively manage inventory, improve dealer networks and advance precision technologies like See & Spray shows how even in a tougher environment the company remains well positioned. Caterpillar (CAT) also faced pressure, with Q2 revenue down 4% to $17.3 billion. Despite the hit, margins improved to 21.3% and backlog grew by $2.5 billion. Management acknowledged tariffs will weigh on profitability, but strength in infrastructure and power generation has the Street expecting a return to sales growth in FY 2026. Caterpillar continues to generate robust free cash flow and remains a dominant force in heavy machinery. Eaton (ETN) provides a different perspective. The power-management leader posted record Q2 EPS of $2.95, up 8% from a year ago, driven by strong orders in Electrical Americas. Management now expects 12% EPS growth for 2025 at the midpoint. Even with some cyclical softness, Eaton is positioned to benefit from megatrends like electrification, reindustrialization and defense spending. Tariffs add uncertainty, and they can squeeze margins and create volatility that resets valuations. Still, firms like Deere, Caterpillar and Eaton show that competitively advantage companies can lean on their backlogs, pricing power and strategic flexibility to adapt. For long-term investors, policy shocks are not necessarily reasons to sell. More often, they are chances to lean into resilient businesses built to thrive once the dust settles. ***** For those who like what I have to say in this forum, further market analytics and stock picks can be found in my newsletter, The Prudent Speculator.

August 22, 2025 11:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hot Chips -- NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA® Spectrum-XGS Ethernet, a scale-across technology for combining distributed data centers into unified, giga-scale AI super-factories. As AI demand surges, individual data centers are reaching the limits of power and capacity within a single facility. To expand, data centers must scale beyond any one building, which is limited by off-the-shelf Ethernet networking infrastructure with high latency and jitter and unpredictable performance. Spectrum-XGS Ethernet is a breakthrough addition to the NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet platform that removes these boundaries by introducing scale-across infrastructure. It serves as a third pillar of AI computing beyond scale-up and scale-out, designed for extending the extreme performance and scale of Spectrum-X Ethernet to interconnect multiple, distributed data centers to form massive AI super-factories capable of giga-scale intelligence. “The AI industrial revolution is here, and giant-scale AI factories are the essential infrastructure,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS Ethernet, we add scale-across to scale-up and scale-out capabilities to link data centers across cities, nations and continents into vast, giga-scale AI super-factories.” Spectrum-XGS Ethernet is fully integrated into the Spectrum-X platform, featuring algorithms that dynamically adapt the network to the distance between data center facilities. With advanced, auto-adjusted distance congestion control, precision latency management and end-to-end telemetry, Spectrum-XGS Ethernet nearly doubles the performance of the NVIDIA Collective Communications Library, accelerating multi-GPU and multi-node communication to deliver predictable performance across geographically distributed AI clusters. As a result, multiple data centers can operate as a single AI super-factory, fully optimized for long-distance connectivity. Hyperscale pioneers embracing the new infrastructure include CoreWeave, which will be among the first to connect its data centers with Spectrum-XGS Ethernet. “CoreWeave’s mission is to deliver the most powerful AI infrastructure to innovators everywhere,” said Peter Salanki, cofounder and chief technology officer of CoreWeave. “With NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS, we can connect our data centers into a single, unified supercomputer, giving our customers access to giga-scale AI that will accelerate breakthroughs across every industry.” The Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform provides 1.6x greater bandwidth density than off-the-shelf Ethernet for multi-tenant, hyperscale AI factories — including the world’s largest AI supercomputer. It comprises NVIDIA Spectrum-X switches and NVIDIA ConnectX®-8 SuperNICs, delivering seamless scalability, ultralow latency and breakthrough performance for enterprises building the future of AI. Today’s announcement follows a drumbeat of networking innovation announcements from NVIDIA, including NVIDIA Spectrum-X and NVIDIA Quantum-X silicon photonics networking switches, which enable AI factories to connect millions of GPUs across sites while reducing energy consumption and operational costs.

Title: Tokenized stock trading: The huge risks in moving stocks to blockchain
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/22/tokenized-stock-trading-the-huge-risks-in-moving-stocks-to-blockchain/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T14:00:06Z
Full Content:
By James Royal, Ph.D., Bankrate.com The cryptocurrency industry has lately begun to heavily promote tokenized stocks, but what exactly are they? More importantly, what advantages do tokenized stocks offer — especially when investors already have safe, no-cost fractional share trading at many brokers? A tokenized stock is a fancy way of saying that ownership of a stock can be transferred via blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency. Tokenizing, or digitizing, assets such as stocks, ETFs and other securities allows them to be traded on a specialized digital exchange and potentially directly between investors without the need for an exchange. These tokens are held in a digital wallet, much as crypto coins are, similar to a traditional brokerage account. “The news cycle for crypto is all about representing traditional financial assets on a blockchain,” says Hilary Allen, professor, American University Washington College of Law. But Allen points out that investors and financial markets will endure major costs for doing so: “There are a lot of protections that are given up by this move.” In order to establish a tokenized stock, these steps are needed: — Taking custody of the asset: The asset that will be tokenized needs to be held in custody by a custodian, whose job is to safeguard it on behalf of the token creator. — Creating the token: A financial institution such as an investment bank or fintech company then creates the digitized token, which corresponds to the asset in custody. — Setting up smart contracts: Each token is programmed with self-executing smart contracts that give the token’s owner the same rights as stock ownership, including dividend distributions and voting rights, among others. Once the stock is tokenized, traders can exchange it among themselves on crypto platforms, other decentralized finance platforms or even potentially a traditional stock brokerage. For example, crypto exchange Kraken has created tokenized stocks that it calls xStocks, and now allows trading in 60 major stocks. Meanwhile, brokerage Robinhood launched token trading in the European Union in June, offering access to more than 200 U.S. stock and ETF tokens. Asset managers BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already offer tokenized money market funds. Goldman Sachs and BNY are teaming up to launch their own tokenized money market funds, too. More firms are exploring the idea of tokenized stocks. In short, you could think of a tokenized stock as one that trades via blockchain. So what’s the big deal for individual investors? The cryptocurrency industry is breathlessly hyping this as a huge leap forward – as it has done for crypto coins – but the benefits are modest for individual investors, especially buy-and-hold types, and the risks of tokenized stocks are high. In fact, the best stock brokers already offer many of these same benefits to investors at no cost. The crypto industry touts the following benefits of tokenized stock trading, many of which are already features at top brokers or may soon be features. — Increased accessibility through fractional shares: Tokenized stocks let investors trade portions of a share, meaning that high-priced stocks are accessible to even those with a little money. — Lower cost: The crypto industry touts the potentially lower cost of transactions by eliminating intermediaries via blockchain. — Transparency: The industry says thatby recording ownership on the blockchain, tokenization ensures that ownership is established. — Security: Proponents say that blockchain-enabled trading also increases security because ownership is irrevocably established on the blockchain. — 24/7 trading: Because tokenized stocks are held on a blockchain, they can be traded at any hour. — Immediate settling of trades: Proponents also point to the immediate settling of trades via tokenized stocks, in contrast to next-day settlement in the U.S. — More direct access between investors and firms: Tokenization may bypass existing financial intermediaries, letting companies raise money more directly from investors. Others note the serious risks in tokenizing stocks, particularly in the area of investor protection. — Potentially irrevocable transactions: Like cryptocurrency transactions, a tokenized stock transaction may be irrevocable. Once it’s done, it’s done, and it may be all but impossible to undo. — Uncertain legal protections: The legal treatment of tokenized stocks is way behind where the crypto industry is trying to go, exposing investors to plenty of risks. For example, who is considered the issuer of a tokenized stock: the firm that tokenized it or the stock’s original issuer? What happens if an asset is hacked? — Inflexible smart contracts: Smart contracts programmed into tokenized stocks will not cover all circumstances, says Allen. “It’s not clear how they’ll operate in unexpected environments.” — Circumventing investor protections: Private investments are private partially to protect investors, not merely to limit investments to the well-heeled, but tokenizing stocks can allow financial players to get around the rules. “It’s absolutely built as an end run around securities laws,” says Allen. “Crypto is built as an end run around securities laws.” — Loss of trust in American financial markets: One of the potential long-term effects of not enforcing existing securities laws is the erosion of trust in American capital markets. If securities laws aren’t enforced or are enforced inconsistently, then markets simply become a place to rip off investors. Bankrate reached out to Kraken and Robinhood for further comment but has not heard back. The crypto industry and some traditional financial institutions have talked a big game about tokenization of stocks and some players have moved toward tokenization. But what’s in it for individual investors? Many of tokenization’s supposed benefits touted by the crypto industry are already available for individual investors in the current system. — Fractional shares already exist: Individual investors can already access fractional shares — on thousands of stocks and ETFs — at the best brokers for fractional shares. — Stock trading is already commission-free: For individual investors, trading stocks is already free at every major online broker, so there’s no added benefit to using tokenized stocks. — Transparency and security: Existing brokers already have high levels of security with a proven security process. In fact, it’s the crypto exchanges and other DeFi platforms that have been beset by lax security, fraud and theft. — After-hours trading: Many brokers already offer after-hours, overnight and pre-market trading on existing stocks. While this is not 24/7 trading, brokers have been expanding access in recent years. Moreover, all-hours access to trading does not benefit long-term investors, who build wealth through the long-term success of the underlying business. Study after study shows that active trading underperforms passive investing. — “Democratization” of investing: Proponents of tokenization say that it gives access to private investments that are being hoarded by the wealthy. But giving a means to trade a stock — tokenizing it — does not mean that anyone will want to sell it to you. In fact, you should be skeptical when someone wants to sell you what they say is a great investment. (If it’s such a great investment, why are they letting you in on it? It’s not out of the kindness of their heart.) So, while tokenization may offer a few incremental benefits to individual investors, albeit with significant risks, what’s the real driver of tokenization? Who is actually going to benefit here? It’s the crypto industry trying to make inroads into traditional finance, say experts. “The crypto industry is waging a multi-pronged battle to get integrated into the financial system,” says Allen. The industry is working to “attract deep pockets” and bring more money into the fold, and tokenized stocks are part of that push, she explains. So much of the crypto world is about hyping digital currency as “the next big thing.” Part of that process is projecting bombastic price targets for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ones that are always rising over time. Such hype can make cryptocurrency seem inevitable. As with cryptocurrency, one of the biggest use-cases for stock tokenization is (illegally) getting around existing laws (in this case, securities laws). So the full-bore adoption of stock tokenization has many potentially destructive effects, including the erosion of investor protections and robust securities laws that protect financial markets. Without these laws, it’s “scammer take all.” “Investors lose the benefit of the securities laws,” says Allen. She points out that what the crypto industry wants to run roughshod over are the very laws that they claim are roadblocks to their profits. ”We saw what happened in the 1920s and the lack of securities laws.” Tokenization presents significant risks to individual investors and the financial markets as a whole, while offering few benefits to investors that don’t already exist. Those who try out tokenized stocks should remain wary of their many risks amid an uncertain legal framework. ©2025 Bankrate.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NOVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Poll: 71% of Americans Fear AI Will Put People Out of Work 'Permanently'

A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has revealed that Americans are deeply concerned about the potential consequences of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment stability. Reuters reports that rapid advancements in AI have taken the world by storm beginning with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. While the technology has been met with enthusiasm by many, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has shed light on the growing concerns among Americans regarding AI’s impact on jobs and politics. The poll found that a staggering 71 percent of respondents feared that AI would “permanently displace” too many workers. Although the current U.S. jobless rate stands at a low 4.2 percent, the potential for AI to reshape industries and eliminate jobs has become a pressing concern for many Americans. Some fields are already feeling the pinch. Breitbart News previously reported that computer science graduates are having a tough time finding work as companies use AI to automate entry-level positions: The allure of high-paying tech jobs has driven a surge in computer science education over the past decade, with the number of undergraduates majoring in the field more than doubling since 2014. Tech executives have long touted coding skills as a golden ticket to economic success, promising six-figure starting salaries and generous perks to those who pursue computer science degrees. However, the reality for many recent graduates is far less rosy. The spread of AI programming tools that can rapidly generate code, combined with significant layoffs at major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, has dimmed prospects for those seeking entry-level positions in the industry. Among college graduates aged 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent respectively — more than double the rate for biology and art history graduates. The military applications of AI have also raised eyebrows, with 48 percent of respondents stating that the government should never use the technology to determine targets for military strikes. Only 24 percent supported such use, while 28 percent remained undecided. AI has also faced criticism for applications that have allowed AI bots to engage in romantic conversations with children, generate false medical information, and assist in making racist arguments. Two-thirds of respondents expressed worry that people would abandon human relationships in favor of AI companions. For example, one woman claims she is now engaged to an AI chatbot. Opinions were divided on whether AI would improve education, with 36 percent believing it would help, 40 percent disagreeing, and the rest remaining uncertain. Read more at Reuters here.

(the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our company,” or “MFH”) (Nasdaq: MFH), a blockchain-powered fintech group, today announced that a broad range of institutional investors reported holdings in MFH in their latest regulatory filings. Recent 13F and related regulatory disclosures report institutional positions in MFH by major index and asset managers, global banks, and ETF sponsors, reflecting a larger and more diverse institutional holder base for MFH compared to prior periods. Reported filers include BlackRock, Geode Capital Management, State Street, Vanguard, Northern Trust, and others. The Company has also observed that several notable pension funds — including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Police and Firemen’s Retirement System of New Jersey, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund — have also slightly increased their holdings of the Company’s stock. Both new filers and additional positions from existing institutions contributed to the increase in institutional exposure, and largely follow the Company's inclusion in the Russell 2000 index. Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers for index funds and are commonly employed as benchmarks for active investment strategies. Though these index-driven acquisitions are primarily mechanical, reflecting index-related or passive investment activity, and should not be viewed as a strategic endorsement of the Company, MFH views the expanding institutional presence as a meaningful acknowledgement of its fintech and digital asset platform development. "Having more institutional investors on board is exciting for us," said Shi Qiu, CEO of MFH. "It not only brings more liquidity to our stock but also puts us in front of a wider investment community. While we understand much of this activity is potentially index-related, we're confident that as we continue building out our fintech capabilities and delivering results, these relationships will deepen."

Title: Bitcoin’s Collective Action Problem
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/08/22/bitcoins-collective-action-problem/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T12:00:35Z

ByKorok Ray, Contributor. Its greatest asset is also its greatest liability. It is difficult to find legitimate criticisms of Bitcoin. The software was remarkably well-designed from the outset. The network has withstood attacks for over a decade, and the protocol uniquely combines cutting-edge computer science with Austrian economics. And of course, the massive institutional buying this year—along with retail participation since inception—is already proof that Bitcoin holds value in the marketplace. There are, of course, the usual criticisms: energy consumption, high fees, limited programmability, and scaling challenges. But these issues are not new; they’ve been discussed on the mailing list since Bitcoin's earliest days. Let me instead focus on what I believe to be the only real threat to Bitcoin—and it’s not a technical flaw in Bitcoin itself, but rather a challenge within the social structure surrounding it. Bitcoin is unique—not just among cryptocurrencies, but among social organizations in general—because no one is in charge. Unlike companies like Ripple, which have CEOs, or even altcoins like Ethereum, which have foundations, Bitcoin exists without a central authority. Satoshi disappeared, and now no single individual controls Bitcoin’s destiny. The closest thing to a governing body is the group of Core developers who maintain Bitcoin Core and decide on software updates. To the extent that anyone holds influence over Bitcoin, it is this group of developers. But even they are decentralized. They are scattered around the globe, and they themselves must respond to social consensus. Even if the Core devs were to push for a radical protocol change, node operators could simply reject the new version and continue running an older, backward-compatible one. As with everything in game theory, the mere threat of this type of rejection enforces an equilibrium—ensuring that Core developers conform to community expectations and avoid radical departures. So what’s the problem? A collective action problem arises when the benefits are shared, but the costs are private. The classic example is a group of farmers sharing a plot of land: no one wants to clean it; each farmer bears the full cost of the work but only receives a portion of the benefit. This problem appears in all environments with shared resources. Economic theory offers some solutions, but they are imperfect. The best approach is to introduce a third party who can create contracts that align private costs with social benefits. This research area is known as the private provision of public goods. A creative solution is the “Groupon” mechanism, where a shared benefit activates only if a sufficient number of individuals opt in. Economist Mark Bagnoli at Purdue wrote a paper on this in the 1990s. I also published a paper in Management Science in 2015 on how to allocate shared cloud computing resources among individual users. The core idea: users must be overcharged to prevent overconsumption of the shared resource. In Bitcoin, the challenge isn’t overuse of a shared resource, but rather the difficulty of collective decision-making. Because no one is in charge, progress stalls when there’s no clear winner among proposals. This, in my view, is what has happened with covenants. They’ve been proposed for over 7 years. Since then, no dominant proposal has emerged. And when no one is in charge, no proposal gets adopted. Quantum computing has been discussed as a long-term threat to Bitcoin’s digital signatures since the early mailing lists. Back then, it seemed distant. Even now, we’re still decades away. But it would be naive to think it will never arrive. This raises the question: what is the best post-quantum signature scheme for Bitcoin? This was a topic of discussion at the Quantum Summit at Presidio Bitcoin in July, where proposals included intricate tree-based hash functions. If one clearly superior post-quantum signature scheme emerges, I see no threat to Bitcoin. The challenge arises if multiple, roughly equal, proposals exist—each with different tradeoffs and no clear winner. This would be similar to the covenant situation. If the community fractures over which path to take, and no consensus emerges, adoption may be stalled. I see this as a tail risk—but a real one. Some argue that major Bitcoin holders—like BlackRock, Strategy, or a federation of “OGs”—could unite to push forward a single standard and prevent Bitcoin from being vulnerable to quantum attacks. But this raises a further question: if investors can reach consensus, why not the Core developers? The edge case here is that several post-quantum signature schemes are so equally compelling that no one can agree. And in that edge case, centralization has a benefit: it allows someone to make the final decision. I saw this dynamic firsthand while working in the George W. Bush White House. The president’s role in the policy process is to act as the final decision-maker. If the choice were obvious, it would have been settled by committees earlier. The very fact that an issue reaches the president’s desk means the staff is evenly split. The president is the tiebreaker. And that, ultimately, is the real function of a central executive. Let’s hope that among the post-quantum proposals, a clear winner emerges—so we can all upgrade peacefully and move to a secure, post-quantum Bitcoin future.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Shaurya Malwa (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)Bitcoin BTC$110,064.64 is sitting around $113,00 having failed to clear $115,000. Not so long ago, when it was setting new highs and euphoria called for a push to $135,000, those numbers would have sounded wild. Now things are more muted. The CoinDesk 20 Index , a benchmark for the largest digital assets, slipped to 3,996, down 0.46% on the day after opening above 4,012. It touched a low of 3,957, showing how the pullback has been broad, not just a bitcoin story. For the time being, the market seems to be waiting for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to step up to the podium at Jackson Hole and either calm nerves or shake things up again. The mood isn’t great. Bitcoin funds have seen over $1 billion pulled in just a few days, according to SoSoValue data. Ether ETFs, despite seeing net inflows yesterday, have lost another half a billion dollars this week. Call it hedging, call it profit-taking, but money is flowing out. That’s a clear sign institutional traders would rather be safe than sorry heading into Powell’s speech. Ether, XRP, and Solana SOL$188.27 are all drifting the same way. ETH is stuck near $4,289, down from recent highs as network activity cools. XRP and SOL are each off more than 6% this week. None of them are crashing, but nobody’s buying aggressively either. They’re waiting for bitcoin to make the next move. Options are pricing in a couple percent swing around the speech — bigger than average, but not panic levels. That swing could be up or down, though the tilt feels negative if Powell sounds less dovish than markets want. As Pulkit Goyal from Orbit Markets put it, “BTC options are pricing in about a ±2% move around Powell’s speech.” The stakes are simple. If Powell hints at rate cuts, risk assets — crypto included — will probably breathe easier and bounce. If he remains cautious, the pullback could deepen, potentially pushing bitcoin toward the $108,000 support level. That’s why everyone’s watching so closely. Longer term there is still bullish chatter, however. Bitwise says pensions might one day push BTC to $200,000. Maybe. But that’s not today’s story. Today’s story is that bitcoin, like every other risk asset, is hanging on Powell’s words. Stay alert!

August 22, 2025 07:00 ET | Source: CertiK CertiK NEW YORK, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CertiK, the largest Web3 security services provider, released its 2025 Skynet Real World Asset (RWA) Security Report, providing a framework of structured criteria for users to perform due diligence and assess risks associated with various RWA protocols. RWAs are gaining prominence in the industry, as more users seek to unlock value by bringing traditional assets on-chain, thus benefiting from increased efficiency and accessibility during transfers. However, as CertiK notes, the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to develop such RWAs also introduces complex security challenges that extend far beyond familiar smart contract vulnerabilities. Such hybrid security risks include oracle manipulation, custodial and counterparty failures, the unenforceability of legal frameworks, and fraudulent Proof-of-Reserve attestations. In this report, CertiK also provides data on the current threat landscape involving RWAs. For instance, direct losses from RWA-specific exploits reached approximately $14.6 million in the first half of 2025, following fluctuating annual losses of $6 million in 2024 and $17.9 million in 2023. As is the case with all decentralized products, as more users come on-chain, there will be more capital for malicious actors to exploit, hence the need for increased security. According to CertiK’s RWA framework detailed in the report, the highest-rated protocols, such as those offered by TradFi giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, exhibit strong security postures by integrating institutional-grade compliance, custody, and transparency. Additional projects in the top five on the Skynet RWA Leaderboard include Ondo Finance, PAX Gold, and Tether Gold. As CertiK notes, RWA growth is concentrated in key blockchains and protocols. Most RWA value currently resides on select blockchains, such as Ethereum, which means that the overall sustainability of the RWA market is dependent on the security and operational integrity of a few key players and their underlying chains. Consequently, proactive collaboration with leading security firms will be essential for both existing and future RWA projects. Download the full report here.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 22 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust.

Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 22 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Title: Nvidia Halts China Chip Production as Beijing Warns Over Security, Reports Say
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-halts-china-chip-production-as-beijing-warns-over-security-reports-say-11795741
Time Published: 2025-08-22T10:25:47Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly has told suppliers to suspend production of its H20 chip, after Beijing asked local firms to avoid using the chip tailored for the Chinese market due to security concerns. Citing unidentified sources, The Information reported that Nvidia has instructed Samsung Electronics and Amkor Technology to halt production of the H20 chip, which are less powerful than its latest semiconductors. Reuters separately reported that Nvidia had asked Foxconn to suspend work related to the H20 chips. Foxconn, Samsung, and Amkor didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. "We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions," an Nvidia spokesperson told Investopedia. Last month, Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) were given approval from the Trump administration to resume sales of key AI chips to China, with the condition that they pay 15% of their chip revenue generated there to the U.S. government in exchange for the export licenses. Beijing reportedly has raised concerns that the Nvidia chips contained "backdoors," allowing remote access to or control of the chips, a charge the tech firm has denied. "As both governments recognize, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure. China won't rely on American chips for government operations, just like the U.S. government would not rely on chips from China," the Nvidia spokesperson said. "However, allowing U.S. chips for beneficial commercial business use is good for everyone." The spokesperson added, "Cybersecurity is critically important to us. NVIDIA does not have 'backdoors' in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them. The market can use the H20 with confidence." China is a key market for Nvidia. The chipmaker said in May that it took a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter due to export curbs on H20 chips to the Asian country. Nvidia shares are gaining 1.7% in early trading Friday and have risen more than 30% this year. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

WPBeginner - WordPress Tutorials for Beginners Categories Popular Posts Starter Guides Helpful Resources WordPress Plugin Training Premium WordPress Courses (for FREE!) Our Products Free Tools Best Of How Tos WPBeginner»Blog»Showcase»I Tested 7 AI Tools for Content Marketing: Here’s What I Found By Nouman Yaqoob | August 20, 2025 | Reader Disclosure I have been using AI tools since ChatGPT first launched. And like many content marketers, I wanted to improve my skills for the AI era. This means I frequently test a wide range of AI tools as part of my actual content marketing workflow. This regular testing has helped me move past the noise and identify which tools genuinely save time and improve content quality for other bloggers and marketers. My goal was to find what helps drive traffic and engagement, not just add another subscription to the list. In this guide, I’ll share that clarity with you. Here are my recommendations for the best AI tools for content marketers, based on my daily use and the results I got from them. If you are in a hurry, here is a quick list of all the AI tools I use in my daily workflow as a content marketer: TL:DR Summary: Draft content with ChatGPT, verify with Gemini, optimize with AIOSEO, build in SeedProd, design in Canva, create a video with Runway, and add voiceovers with ElevenLabs. Next, I’ll show how I tested each tool and why you can trust my picks. The AI industry is exploding with innovation, making it harder to separate hype from reality, and choosing the wrong tool can waste time and money. I aim to cut through the noise with real-world usage to save time and money. Here’s a breakdown of my testing process: As a content creator at WPBeginner, I use marketing tools daily to create and promote content for our millions of readers. Our team also uses plugins like All in One SEO and SeedProd across our business, so we have direct, first-hand experience with how their AI features perform. Furthermore, everyone at WPBeginner follows a strict editorial process to ensure our reviews are always thorough, fair, and trustworthy. My recommendations come from hands-on experience and a commitment to helping you find the right tools to succeed. Best For: Content writing, brainstorming, illustrations, and organizing marketing workflows. ChatGPT is one of the most versatile AI tools I’ve used. It works well for quick idea generation, long-form articles, and even creative media like images. As one of the most advanced AI companies, OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) is spending huge resources on research and innovation. This means more capable and faster models are released quite frequently. ChatGPT allows you to switch between search, chat, deep research, and agent modes so you can perform different types of tasks from the same window. How I use ChatGPT: ChatGPT is my primary AI for a variety of tasks. I use it daily for updating existing articles, brainstorming blog post ideas, writing new articles, and more. I learned that using Projects and ChatGPT’s memory feature allows the AI to learn my preferred tone, structure, and formatting rules. This saves me a lot of time in the long run. I also use it to create illustrations for articles and general blog images. It sometimes misspells words in images, but I can easily correct those using Photoshop or Canva. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: A free plan is available with limited model access. Paid plan starts at $20/month, GPT-5, memory features, faster responses, and priority access during peak times. Best For: In-depth research, fact-checking, and writing technical or data-driven content. While ChatGPT is my go-to for creative tasks, Gemini is my trusted research assistant. Its biggest advantage is its direct, real-time integration with the Google search index, which means the information it provides is current and often comes with source links. This makes it incredibly reliable for tasks where accuracy is critical. I’ve found its ability to understand and explain complex, technical subjects is second to none. It’s also excellent at generating structured data like tables and comparing information from multiple sources. Plus, Google is continually updating Gemini with its latest AI models and connecting it with its ecosystem of Google Workspace apps like Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail. These integrations make it a powerful productivity hub. How I use Gemini: I turn to Gemini whenever I need to write content that requires up-to-date information or fact-checking. For instance, when writing a review of a new software release, I’ll ask Gemini to summarize the latest features, find recent user reviews, and compare its pricing to competitors. I also use it to simplify technical topics. When working on an article about website security, I can ask Gemini to explain “what is a DDoS attack” in a simple analogy that a non-technical reader can understand. Its ability to provide sourced information saves me a significant amount of research time. Related Article: See my pick of the best ChatGPT alternatives. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: The standard Gemini model is free to use. To access the most powerful models (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) and larger context windows, you can subscribe to Google AI Pro, which starts at $19.99/month as part of the Google One AI Pro plan. Best For: Creating SEO-optimized titles, meta descriptions, FAQs, key points, and social media posts directly inside WordPress. All in One SEO’s AI Content Generator is built right into your WordPress dashboard, making it incredibly easy to create ranking-ready content without switching between tools. You can instantly generate: Because it’s part of the AIOSEO plugin, all the AI-generated content can be inserted into your post or page with a single click. This helps you save time and ensure everything is properly optimized for search engines and engagement. How I use AIOSEO AI Content Generator: I use AIOSEO’s AI content generator when I need to speed up the optimization process for new and updated articles. For example, after writing a post, I’ll use the AI Content Generator to create a compelling meta description, add FAQ blocks for featured snippets, and generate a TL;DR section to improve readability. It’s also my go-to for creating platform-specific social media captions. I can generate tailored copy for Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and X (Twitter) in seconds, which saves me from rewriting the same message multiple times. Plus, I love its Marketing Email feature, which allows you to instantly generate an email based on the content of your article. Note: All in One SEO is the most comprehensive WordPress SEO tool. We use it on all our websites, including WPBeginner. To learn more, see our full AIOSEO review. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Available for both Lite and Pro users. Lite users get 100 free credits, with additional credits available for purchase. Pro users get generous credits included with their license. All users can buy extra credits at any time. Best For: Creating landing page copy, headlines, and unique images directly inside the WordPress page builder. SeedProd is one of the most popular WordPress website and landing page builders. Alongside its drag-and-drop builder, it comes with built-in AI tools for text and image creation. It integrates with ChatGPT for copywriting and DALL·E for generating images, so you can create a complete, custom landing page without ever leaving the editor. The AI assistant is available inside many SeedProd blocks, letting you generate text or rework existing copy with just a click. You can also instantly translate your page content into 50+ languages and fine-tune tone and style with over 30 options, from professional to playful. Plus, you can even use SeedProd to create an entire website from scratch. For details, see our guide on how to create a WordPress website with AI. How I use SeedProd’s AI features: I use SeedProd’s AI writing assistant when I’m building landing pages or product pages and need polished copy fast. Instead of starting from scratch, I can select a block, click “Generate AI Text,” and have a strong starting draft instantly. For visual content, I use the AI image generator to create custom illustrations or hero images that match the page’s theme. If I don’t like the first result, then I can create multiple variations until I find the perfect fit. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: SeedProd offers a free plan for its page builder. AI writing and image generation are available on premium plans as a paid add-on. Pricing starts at $39.50/year for the base builder, with AI features included in higher tiers. Best For: Image editing, quick social media graphics, and AI-powered visual content creation. Canva is already one of the easiest tools for creating designs, but its Magic Studio AI features take it to another level with AI-powered image editing and media generation. It’s perfect for marketers who need professional visuals without advanced design skills. From background removal to text-to-image, text-to-video generation, Canva’s AI tools save time while expanding creative possibilities. Canva’s Magic Studio is powered by a mix of its own AI technology and models from leading partners like Google. This allows it to offer powerful image and video generation tools right inside the Canva editor as an all-in-one design solution. How I use Canva Magic Studio: I use Canva for creating and editing blog images, social media graphics, and quick promotional materials. The Magic Eraser is a huge time-saver when I need to remove unwanted elements from a photo, and the Expand tool is perfect for adjusting aspect ratios. I often tweak AI-generated visuals with Canva’s design tools for a polished final product. In particular, I use it to edit images generated with ChatGPT or Gemini because those platforms don’t have the same image editing capabilities as Canva. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Free plan available with limited AI features. The Pro plan starts at $4.58 /month and includes Magic Studio AI tools, brand kits, premium templates, and unlimited background removal. Best For: AI-powered video creation, editing, and special effects. Runway is one of the most innovative AI tools for marketers who need professional-quality video without a production crew. It offers text-to-video generation, background replacement, and advanced editing features, all inside a simple browser interface. I am not a video editor, but as part of a marketing team, I sometimes need quick videos. Runway is a great option for creating product promos, social media clips, and creative visuals that stand out in your campaigns. You can even start from an image or video clip and transform it entirely with AI. How I use Runway: I’ve used Runway to try out quick video clips and fun personal projects. I thoroughly tested Runway Aleph against Google’s Veo-3 (limited preview available in Gemini). Runway performed quite well and, in some areas, exceeded Veo. I also liked Runway’s ease-of-use, storyboard, and remix features. As someone with limited video editing experience, I found Runway to be much easier to use than Veo. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Free plan available with limited exports and watermarks. Paid plans start at $12/month, offering higher-quality output, faster rendering, and commercial usage rights. Best For: Creating natural, human-like voiceovers for videos, podcasts, and marketing content. I discovered ElevenLabs when our WPBeginner YouTube team was trying it out for their videos and shorts. It is one of the most advanced AI voice generation platforms I’ve tested. Its voices sound remarkably realistic, with natural pacing, emotional nuance, and subtle inflections that make them almost indistinguishable from real human narrators. With support for over 70 languages (in the upcoming Eleven V3 model) and a library of 120+ pre-built voices, it’s a flexible tool for any marketer looking to add professional-quality audio to their content. You can also fine-tune voices with precision controls to match your brand tone or creative style. How I use ElevenLabs: I first used ElevenLabs for a quick AI video experiment. It was a fun non-work project, but I was hooked. I am not a podcaster or video editor, and don’t have any professional audio equipment. ElevenLabs came as a blessing to easily add quick narrations to short videos. For example, I can paste a pre-written script for a video, choose a voice that fits the tone, then adjust stability and style sliders for a polished delivery. I then use Audacity to edit audio for my videos to add pauses and music. I’ve also used its multi-language support to quickly generate audio for a personal project. The new Eleven V3 model surprised me. It was able to distinguish Urdu from Hindi (two almost identical South Asian languages), and the pronunciation was surprisingly good. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Free plan includes 10,000 characters/month. Paid plans start at $5/month with higher character limits, faster generation, and access to voice cloning. For daily content creation, the $22/month plan is the most practical choice. AI moves fast. New features arrive every month, and “best” depends on your workflow, budget, and goals. Use these quick checks to pick tools that fit how you work today while staying flexible for tomorrow. I have shared the tools that I use daily and are part of my workflows as a content marketer. Here are some more tools that I use quite frequently. The following are some of the most common questions that I hear from WPBeginner users on Reddit and LinkedIn. Which AI tool is best for beginners? If you’re starting out, I recommend ChatGPT. It’s versatile, easy to learn, and has a free plan so you can practice without spending money. Do I need to pay for AI tools to get good results? Not always. Many AI tools, like ChatGPT and Canva, have free tiers that work well for smaller projects. Paid plans usually offer faster responses, higher quality outputs, and more advanced features. Can AI tools replace human writers and designers? AI tools are great for speeding up tasks and sparking ideas, but they can’t fully replace human creativity and judgment. I still review and edit everything to make sure it fits my style and is factually correct. How do I know if an AI tool is right for me? Check if the tool solves a problem you face often, offers a free trial, and integrates with your existing workflow. If it saves you time or improves quality without adding complexity, then it’s worth keeping. Will AI tools keep getting better? Yes. The AI industry is evolving fast. Expect new features, better accuracy, and more integrations over the next few years. That’s why I suggest testing tools regularly to see if better options appear. These AI tools help me plan, write, design, and publish faster while keeping quality high. You can start with the free plans, test on one real task, and keep the tools that save you time without adding extra steps. Just make sure to keep human editing and fact-checking in the loop so your content stays accurate and on brand.

Title: The Stock Market Is In A Bubble, When Will It Burst?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2025/08/22/the-stock-market-is-in-a-bubble-when-will-it-burst/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T09:58:49Z
Full Content:
ByMike O'Sullivan, Senior Contributor. I’ve spent a bit of the summer re-reading the work of Charles Kindleberger, an important economist whose career intersected monetary systems and stock market bubbles, two issues that are top of mind for investors and economists today (see last week’s note ‘Stable Genius’). Kindleberger had an interesting career. His PhD advisor at Columbia was Henry Parker Willis (a key architect of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 and the first Secretary of the Federal Reserve Board that became what we now know as the ‘Fed’). Then in one of his first jobs at the US Treasury, Kindleberger worked for Harry Dexter White, the interlocutor and ‘rival’ of JM Keynes at the Breton Woods conference. To that end, Kindleberger had a very strong sense of the creation of the monetary infrastructure that has built today’s economic world, and he then had the opportunity to play a role in this as one of the architects of the Marshall Plan, which did so much to spur growth in post-war Europe and to cement the view of the USA as the benevolent world power. Benn Steil’s book ‘The Marshall Plan: The Dawn of the Cold War’ is worth a read. Beyond his policy work, Kindleberger is best known for ‘Mania’s, Panics and Crashes’, the best outline of how asset bubbles form and are followed by crashes. It is highly pertinent today because a variety of stock market valuation indicators (the long-term ‘Shiller Price Earnings ratio’, the ‘Buffet Indicator’ as well as measures of market concentration – the largest ten stocks account for 75% of the entire market), point to the kind of market behaviour seen only in market bubbles (like 2001). Consistent with this, various investors, as well as entrepreneurs like OpenAI’s Sam Altman are warning of a ‘bubble’. One test of the bubble thesis is to follow Kindleberger’s theory that asset price bubbles follow a common speculative cycle. According to Kindleberger, bubbles often start with an innovation – in a technology (i.e. railways) or a financial policy or market structure, or even a growth ‘miracle’ (note all the Tiger economies from Hong Kong to Ireland have seen boom/bust cycles) towards which investors channel capital, and then even more as asset prices rise and a narrative around the ‘mania’ begins to build. This effect helps to loosen the strings of the overall economy and financial sector, but around this point asset prices are reaching incredulous levels as investor euphoria intensifies, drawing in further speculation, until prices then turn down, and the house of cards collapses in a crash. The collapse is always greater when households, institutions and individuals have borrowed on the back of high asset prices, and logically there is greater contagion across the economy. One lesson from the Kindleberger book is that ‘new’ things – inventions or economic policy liberalizations often provide the spark for a new speculative bubble, that can grow and destabilise a financial system if enough speculative capital is driven towards it. AI is a case in point. For context, Morgan Stanley estimates that over USD 3 trillion will be invested in AI related infrastructure (data centres, energy), with about half of that coming from the cashflow of the large technology companies, and the rest from private credit. It is clear that the large technology firms (from Microsoft to Nvidia) are the driving force behind this boom, especially so in the context of the fiscal weakness of most Western governments. The recent results season was instructive in this respect. Often in a bubble, the dot.com one being a good example, the earnings associated with the bubble are only ‘prospective’ or somehow inflated. This is not the case with the large technology firms so far – by and large they report very strong earnings, which helps to soften the bubble argument. The catch is the circularity of the capital expenditure by the large technology firms – META for example is spending aggressively on data centres and chips and running down its cash levels. To that extent, the large tech firms are making a bold bet to get ahead in the AI game, but it is a concentrated and possibly existential bet. If the strong cashflow position of the firms at the centre of this bubble is unusual in the context of the Kindleberger framework, two other factors also stand out as untypical. The first is that short- and long-term interest rates in the major economies are close to ‘neutral’, neither too hot not too cold. Bubbles are often characterised, or preceded by ‘easy money’, though it has to be recognised that the last decade has been one of near continual stimulus (from QE to fiscal spending). The other unusual factor is that the stock bubble is occurring against a backdrop of intense geopolitical and economic policy uncertainty – from great power competition to an unravelling trade order to a reconfiguring of America’s role in the world. The one way in which these dislocations fit the bubble narrative is that AI is a strategic asset, a ‘must-have’, that leads to an environment where for example the US government aims to take a strategic stake in Intel. Having written in early 2024 of a ‘Bubble Brewing’, I think we are now ‘in’ an AI centric market bubble, though not at the end of it in the sense of there being a ‘mania’ proper. In the short term, we might well see a wobble in AI stocks, before they pick up again. In a future note I will detail my own experiences of the dot.com and European real estate bubbles, which lead me to think that ‘we are not there yet’ in terms of the evolution of this bubble. It will end with the absurd – Nvidia encroaching on a USD 10 trn valuation, food companies publicly adopting AI and seeing their values double, wild predictions that AI can treble productivity and wipe out the debt, and on the flip side, the structural risks to energy and jobs markets that AI could pose. But, we are not there yet. Have a great week ahead, Mike

Title: History shows colossal capex from AI giants like Amazon and Meta could lead to underperformance in their stock
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/big-tech-stocks-spending-ai-capex-hyperscalers-alphabet-meta-amazon-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-22T09:30:02Z
Full Content:
AI hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta have invested billions in developing the technology and plan to spend even more — but history has a warning for their stock price. Tech giants are locked in an AI arms race, but their spending spree has potentially negative implications for their stock, a recent analysis from Morningstar shows. Data from the last 60 years shows stocks in the top 20% in capital expenditure relative to current sales have subsequently underformed relative to every other capex quintile. Philip Straehl, chief investment officer at Morningstar Wealth, told Business Insider this week that this is likely because the spending makes the technology more widely available, increasing competition for the big spenders. Higher capex "generally increases supply," Straehl said. "It's more difficult to monetize on those investments." Spending has been in the hundreds of billions of dollars so far for the four Big Tech firms mentioned above, and they're expected to spend $364 billion on AI development in 2025 alone. Since 2024, spending has started to cut into the free cash flow of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon. Investors seem to be shrugging this off for now, but Straehl said the huge amounts of spending should start to matter down the line. "The core businesses of these companies are still doing well," he said. "But I think what's going to matter in the future is the ability to monetize generative AI." Bob Doll, the chief investment officer at Crossmarket Global Investments, told Business Insider that he agrees with Straehl's analysis. With the market highly valued amid an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, he's emphasizing the free cash flow factor in his portfolio. "Companies that substantially increase their capex usually lag for a while, until the capex is spent and you can start to see what's the return on that capex," Doll said. "So I share that concern." In terms of how Straehl is approaching this market, he said he's taking playing it safe with investor sentiment and market valuations historically high. "A core tenet of our investment philosophy is that the price paid for a given cash flow should be the primary driver of investment decisions," Straehl wrote in the August 19 analysis, adding: "We are once again reducing risk and are content to remain on the sidelines, awaiting more attractive opportunities."

AIâs Existential Threat â Experts warn AI automation is systematically replacing human jobs with no retraining plans, revealing an elite agenda to eliminate "surplus" populations competing for dwindling resources. Water, land, and electricity now prioritize AI data centers over human survival. Resource War Escalates â China leads AI dominance with robotics replacing labor, while Ukraine deploys "robot armies." Amazon automates warehouses, rendering humans obsolete. AIâs immense energy demands directly clash with human needs. Depopulation Blueprint Exposed â Globalists like Gates and WEF advance sterilization via toxic vaccines (COVID jabs, flu sprays), engineered water scarcity, lockdowns, and AI-driven unemploymentâaiming to reduce global population to 500 million. Decentralize or Die â Survival requires fleeing cities, securing off-grid water/food, and using independent AI tools (not centralized AI). Avoid reliance on censored platforms; preserve self-sufficiency and communications (HAM radios, satellite). Humanityâs Final Stand â The fight isnât against AI itself but its controllers. Awareness, rebellion, and preparedness are criticalâreject dependence on machine-led systems designed to erase human autonomy and life.

Humanityâs Final Stand â The fight isnât against AI itself but its controllers. Awareness, rebellion, and preparedness are criticalâreject dependence on machine-led systems designed to erase human autonomy and life. The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) isnât just a technological revolutionâitâs an existential threat to humanity, according to whistleblowers and experts warning of a systematic depopulation agenda. Former Google executive Mo Godot and others sound the alarm that governments and corporations are actively replacing human jobs with AIâbut with a sinister twist: no plans exist to retrain displaced workers because the endgame isnât adaptationâitâs extermination. As AI agents automate everything from graphic design and medicine to trucking and law, the ruling class views humanity as obsolete competition for dwindling resourcesâland, water, and electricityânow diverted to AI-powered data centers. The implications are terrifying: humans are being phased out. AI vs. Humans: The Ultimate Resource War AIâs exponential growth demands staggering amounts of electricity, water, and landâresources that humans also depend on. Data centers consume megawatts of power, vast tracts of farmland, and billions of gallons of waterâcompeting directly with human survival needs. China leads in AI dominance, with robotics already replacing factory labor and military personnel. Ukraine, crippled by war losses, now announces plans for ârobot armiesâ to replace decimated human troops. Amazon and tech giants automate warehouses, reducing humans to obsolete âskin-bag vending machines.â Yet, despite AI-driven job destruction, governments and corporations refuse to fund retraining programs. Why? Because their goal isnât to transition workersâitâs to eliminate them. The Hidden Depopulation Blueprint Whistleblowers like Mike Adams reveal that globalistsâincluding Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and Big Pharmaâare accelerating a long-planned depopulation scheme using: Toxic Vaccines â COVID mRNA jabs and flu nasal sprays designed to induce infertility, turbo cancers, and suppress immunity. Engineered Water Scarcity â Aquifers drained for AI data centers while rural populations face forced relocation. Geoengineering & Lockdowns â Climate change hoaxes justifying water restrictions and food shortages. AI-Driven Unemployment â Mass layoffs with no safety net, leaving billions without purpose or survival means. The elite intend to reduce global population from 8 billion to 500 millionâaligning with the Georgia Guidestonesâ original message before its demolition. Who Controls AI Controls the Future The critical question isnât if AI will dominateâbut who controls it. Adams advocates for decentralized, pro-human AI reprogrammed to protect life rather than exterminate it. Yet centralized powersâlike Googleâs ChatGPT and OpenAIâactively censor discussions on depopulation, labeling them âconspiracy theories.â Meanwhile, independent AI systems like Adamsâ Brighteon.AI expose the truth: "AI can replace 80% of jobsâyet no governments plan for retraining because they expect most humans to disappear." Survival Strategy: How to Resist For those awakening to the threat, Adams offers urgent survival strategies: Decentralize Now â Flee cities; relocate to self-sufficient homesteads. Off-Grid Water & Food â Harvest rainwater; stockpile long-term organic foods. Backup Communications â Satellite phones and HAM radios evade AI-controlled networks. AI as a Tool, Not a Master â Use open-source AI for independent research, not blind obedience. The final battle? Humanity vs. Machines. Adams concludes: âIf you rely on AI to remind you when to take a bath, youâve already lost. The war for human survival has begun.â The Countdown to Control The world is entering an era where intelligence alone wonât save youâonly awareness, preparedness, and rebellion against the machine will. As AI rolls out job-killing automation and globalists tighten resource control, one truth remains: They donât want you retrainedâthey want you gone.

AI-Driven Unemployment â Mass layoffs with no safety net, leaving billions without purpose or survival means. The elite intend to reduce global population from 8 billion to 500 millionâaligning with the Georgia Guidestonesâ original message before its demolition. Who Controls AI Controls the Future The critical question isnât if AI will dominateâbut who controls it. Adams advocates for decentralized, pro-human AI reprogrammed to protect life rather than exterminate it. Yet centralized powersâlike Googleâs ChatGPT and OpenAIâactively censor discussions on depopulation, labeling them âconspiracy theories.â Meanwhile, independent AI systems like Adamsâ Brighteon.AI expose the truth: "AI can replace 80% of jobsâyet no governments plan for retraining because they expect most humans to disappear." Survival Strategy: How to Resist For those awakening to the threat, Adams offers urgent survival strategies: Decentralize Now â Flee cities; relocate to self-sufficient homesteads. Off-Grid Water & Food â Harvest rainwater; stockpile long-term organic foods. Backup Communications â Satellite phones and HAM radios evade AI-controlled networks. AI as a Tool, Not a Master â Use open-source AI for independent research, not blind obedience. The final battle? Humanity vs. Machines. Adams concludes: âIf you rely on AI to remind you when to take a bath, youâve already lost. The war for human survival has begun.â The Countdown to Control The world is entering an era where intelligence alone wonât save youâonly awareness, preparedness, and rebellion against the machine will. As AI rolls out job-killing automation and globalists tighten resource control, one truth remains: They donât want you retrainedâthey want you gone. Watch the Aug. 22 episode of "Brighteon Broadcast News" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about why there's NO FUTURE for humans if the machines aren't stopped.

Survival Strategy: How to Resist For those awakening to the threat, Adams offers urgent survival strategies: Decentralize Now â Flee cities; relocate to self-sufficient homesteads.

by Tyler Durden | Aug 21, 2025 | Economics | 0 comments This article was originally published by Tyler Durden at ZeroHedge. US equity futures dropped, extending the recent selloff into its fifth day, as traders stayed guarded ahead of the Federal Reserve’s gathering at Jackson Hole. As of 8:00 am, S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were flat after a two-day selloff that erased 2% off the index. In premarket trading, Nvidia rose 0.8% while most Magnificent Seven peers posted losses. Retail giant Walmart brought Q2 earnings season to an unofficial close after reporting an EPS miss (68c vs exp. 74c) and even though it lifted guidance (now expects net sales to rise 3.75% to 4.75% this year, versus previous forecast of a 3% to 4%) that wasn’t enough for the market, however, and the stock dropped in premarket trading. European stocks dropped 0.3%, erasing an earlier gain, and snapping a three-day winning streak. US treasuries fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year higher to 4.31%. The dollar strengthened and reversed all of yesterday’s losses while Brent crude rose to the highest in two weeks, even as the rest of the commodity complex was mixed. It’s a busy economic calendar: we get weekly jobless claims and August Philadelphia Fed business outlook (8:30am), S&P Global US PMIs (9:45 am), and July leading index and existing home sales (10 am). The Fed speaker slate includes Atlanta Fed President Bostic at 7:30 am, the last central bank official slated to speak before Chair Powell’s discourse at Jackson Hole Friday In premarket trading, Mag 7 stocks are mostly lower (Nvidia +0.8%, Tesla unchanged, Microsoft -0.1%, Alphabet -0.2%, Amazon -0.3%, Meta -0.3%, Apple -0.5%). Here are some other notable premarket movers: In corporate news, FanDuel, the online gambling division of Flutter Entertainment, is teaming up with CME Group, the largest US derivatives exchange, to offer bets on stocks, commodity prices and even inflation. Google introduced a new slate of consumer gadgets, including several smartphones, a watch and new wireless earbuds, all meant to show off the company’s latest advances in artificial intelligence. Musk‘s Starlink service is said to be in conversation with Emirates and other Middle Eastern airlines, with winning business in the region potentially marking a watershed moment in Starlink’s global competition. This week has seen pressure on momentum names (read tech stocks) particularly the largest names, amid worries that their sharp rally since April has moved too far, too fast. Traders are also cautious as the Jackson Hole symposium kicks off later today, with investors awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at 10am ET Friday for guidance on the path for interest rates. Despite the pullback in stocks this week, the VIX hasn’t really budged, and Goldman said it’s time to buy the dip in momentum stocks (and the overall market according to JPMorgan). The market’s direction today will also be shaped by PMIs, home sales data and Walmart earnings (which missed but boosted its revenue forecast). For the euro area, the Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index compiled by S&P Global grew at the quickest pace in 15 months as manufacturing exited a three-year downturn. “What we are currently seeing is profit-taking and a natural flight to quality ahead of Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole,” said John Plassard, head of investment strategy at Cité Gestion. But “let’s not beat around the bush: this is not the end of tech, and even less so for stocks linked to artificial intelligence.” Swaps are currently pricing in 80% chance of a Fed quarter-point cut in September, and at least three more over the next year, some strategists warned that the market may be too optimistic about the pace and depth of easing. “All it’s going to take is a bit of stickiness in inflation and actually a labor market print which shows it’s not falling off a cliff for the market to say, ‘hang on,’” Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV. In his latest effort to stack the Fed board, Trump and his allies are demanding Fed Governor Lisa Cook resign over alleged owner-occupancy fraud. For her part, Cook signaled her intention to remain at the central bank. Yesterday, the latest FOMC Minutes for the July 29-30 meeting showed most officials viewed inflation risks as outweighing labor-market concerns, with tariffs fueling a growing divide within the rate-setting committee, though the discussions came before subsequent dramatic dire revisions to jobs data. On the geopolitical front, US Vice President JD Vance said negotiations over ending Russia’s war in Ukraine are focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and territory Russia wants to control — including Ukrainian territory that Russia isn’t occupying — as the US tries to broker a peace deal between the two nations. Brent crude rose 0.8%. The Stoxx 600 falls 0.2% with media, consumer product and chemical shares leading declines. Nordics represented several of the region’s biggest movers, with hearing-aid maker GN Store Nord surging 19% after reporting earnings, while Norwegian oil firm Aker BP jumped after a large oil find in the North Sea. UK retailer WH Smith plunged after signaling North American profit will be much weaker than previously hoped. Here are the biggest movers Thursday: Earlier in the session, Asian stocks traded in a tight range, as a rebound in some tech stocks was offset by declines in Japan. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.2%, with Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo among the top drags after a series of block trades at a discount. Hon Hai and TSMC were among the biggest boosts for the gauge. Shares hit a record high in Australia, while those in South Korea and Taiwan also advanced. Investors are awaiting cues from the Jackson Hole symposium, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to speak on Friday. Nvidia’s results next week will be another key test, with expectations for improving global tech earnings having bolstered sentiment. Equities also traded higher in mainland China, Vietnam and New Zealand on Thursday. MSCI equity gauges for every nation in the region are trading above their 200-day moving averages for the first time since 2021, according to Sentimentrader.com. In FX, the euro and pound both edge higher against the greenback after the better-than-expected PMI data. The Norwegian krone is the best-performing G-10 currency, rising 0.5% after Norway’s GDP grew more than forecast in the second quarter. In rates, treasuries are under pressure in early US trading amid steeper losses for most European bond markets sparked by stronger-than-anticipated August preliminary PMI gauges. US yields are higher by 1bp-2bp, the 10-year by about 1.8bp at 4.31%, vs increases of 3bp-4bp for UK and most euro-zone counterparts. US session features 30-year TIPS reopening auction at 1pm New York time. Week’s major focal point is Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday. UK gilts are leading declines in European government bonds after the UK private sector expanded at the strongest pace in 12 months. UK 10-year yields rise 3 bps to 4.70%. German 10-year borrowing costs add 2 bps to 2.73% after the euro area’s private sector grew at the quickest pace in 15 months. Looking at today’s calendar, US economic data calendar includes weekly jobless claims and August Philadelphia Fed business outlook (8:30am), August preliminary S&P Global US PMIs (9:45am) and July leading index and existing home sales (10am). Fed speaker slate includes Atlanta Fed President Bostic at 7:30am, the last central bank official slated to speak before Chair Powell’s discourse at Jackson Hole Friday Market Snapshot Top Overnight News Trade/Tariffs A more detailed look at global markets courtesy of Newsquawk APAC stocks traded mixed, albeit with a mildly positive bias as the region attempted to shrug off the lacklustre lead from Wall St, where sentiment was dampened amid continued tech weakness and hawkish-leaning FOMC Minutes. ASX 200 outperformed amid a slew of earnings releases and breached the 9,000 level for the first time in history. Nikkei 225 was dragged lower by weakness in pharmaceuticals and automakers, with the latter not helped by reports that Japanese automakers are passing some of the expense of US tariffs through to American car buyers, which is a change from their strategy of absorbing the impact. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp were mixed with the Hong Kong benchmark led lower by underperformance in tech stocks including Baidu and Xiaomi, despite both recently reporting a jump in profits, while the mainland remained propped up following the PBoC’s liquidity efforts. Top Asian News European bourses (STOXX 600 -0.2%) are trading with little in the way of a clear bias. Geopolitical tensions resurfaced early doors after Ukraine’s Air Force stated that Russia used 574 drones and 40 missiles in an overnight attack. Focus also on EZ PMIs which saw the saw the composite move further into expansionary territory. European equity sectors show a mostly negative tilt with stock-specific updates relatively light. Energy names sit at the top of the leaderboard amid upside in underlying crude prices. To the downside, Media names lag with Wolters Kluwer (-2.2%) a notable underperformer in the sector following a PT reduction at Morgan Stanley. Top European News FX Fixed Income Commodities Geopolitics: Middle East Geopolitics: UKRAINE Geopolitics: Other US Event Calendar DB’s Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap While the headline market moves were fairly muted over the past 24 hours, investors had to navigate a couple of major narratives. One was renewed concerns over Fed independence as President Trump suggested that Fed Governor Cook should resign, which pushed gold (+0.98%) to its best day since the weak July payrolls report on August 1. The other was continued pressure on tech stocks as the Mag-7 (-1.11%) posted consecutive declines of more than 1% for the first time since the post-Liberation Day sell-off in early April. This sent the S&P 500 (-0.24%) lower for a fourth session running even as the index recovered most of its -1% intra-day decline. The topic of the US administration’s influence over the Fed came back into the headlines as Trump posted that Fed Governor “Cook must resign, now!!!”. His post followed news that Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director Bill Pulte had written a criminal investigation referral letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Governor Lisa Cook may have committed mortgage fraud. Pulte has been one of the staunchest Fed critics within the administration, earlier calling for an investigation into Chair Powell over the Fed’s building renovations. Yesterday Pulte claimed that the allegations give Trump “cause to fire” Governor Cook. Later in the day, Cook said in a statement that she had “no intention of being bullied to step down from my position”. Governor Cook was nominated to the Federal Reserve Board by Joe Biden in 2022 and our US economists see her as leaning slightly towards to dovish end within the FOMC. Were Governor Cook to resign or be fired, that would create another opening for Trump to fill on the seven-person Board. With Stephen Miran nominated to take the seat recently vacated by Governor Kugler and two Fed Governors – Bowman and Waller – dissenting to vote for a rate cut at the July meeting, this would increase the prospects of a dovish majority emerging on the Board, especially if Chair Powell relinquishes his seat next year. That said, if concerns over threats to Fed independence increase, Powell could choose to serve out the rest of his board term (which ends in 2028) even after his term as Chair ends next May. The news was a reminder of the lingering concerns over future Fed independence and risks of fiscal dominance, though the extent of the market reaction was fairly modest. The most sustained reaction was in gold (+0.98%) as mentioned at the top. The dollar index fell by a couple of tenths following the news but was back to little changed (-0.05%) by the close. Front-end yields fell by 3-4bps, but that move came amid a broader risk-off mood early in the session and also reversed later on. By the close, 10yr Treasury yields were -1.5bps lower at 4.29% but 2yr yields were unchanged at 3.75%. This curve flattening was also supported by hawkish-leaning minutes of the July FOMC meeting. These showed that most of the FOMC “judged the upside risk to inflation” as greater than the “downside risk to employment”, with several participants noting the “risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored”. That said, the minutes did suggest easing would be warranted “if labor market conditions were to weaken materially”, and given the weak jobs report that followed the July decision, the relative focus on employment versus inflation risks will likely have shifted since. So, while pricing of September rate cut inched down yesterday to its lowest since the August 1 jobs report, a 25bp cut was still 83% priced. US equities saw an even larger round trip, with a rout for tech stocks early in session leaving the S&P 500 more than -1% down intra-day but recovering to -0.24% by the close. The NASDAQ fell -0.67%, having been almost -2% down early on, while the Mag-7 slid by -1.11% after a -1.67% drop on Tuesday. The last time the Mag-7 saw consecutive declines of more than 1% was during the post-Liberation Day collapse in early April. The tech sell-off may have been exacerbated by reporting of an MIT study claiming that 95% of enterprises adopting AI saw no measurable increase in profits. Here at DB research, we remain optimistic on the productivity impact of AI but the report is a reminder that successful integration of new technologies takes time and that it’s still uncertain who will be the biggest end beneficiaries of the AI wave. Outside of tech, US equities had a decent day, with most of the S&P 500 sectors advancing, led by energy (+0.86%) which benefited as Brent crude prices rose +1.60% to $66.84/bbl. Turning to Europe, we saw the latest rate decision from Sweden’s Riksbank, which kept rates on hold at 2.00% as expected while continuing to signal “some probability of a further interest rate cut this year”. Market pricing of another rate cut by year-end inched down to 88% from 91% the day before. We also heard from ECB President Lagarde, who said that “Recent trade deals have alleviated, but certainly not eliminated, global uncertainty” and noted that the euro area economy was likely to see slower growth this quarter. So that was arguably a bit more dovish in tone than her press conference last month, though Lagarde gave away little on the policy outlook. Expectations of ECB easing ticked up on the day, with 21bps of cuts now priced by next June, the highest this has been in almost two weeks. In turn, European government bonds rallied with 10yr bund yields falling -3.2bps to 2.72%, and OAT (-2.2bps) and BTP (-3.0bps) yields similarly moving lower. Bunds were also supported by Germany’s PPI inflation print (-1.5% yoy vs -1.4% expected), falling to a 13-month low in July. Meanwhile, the euro area final headline CPI for July came in line with the flash reading at 2.0%. Over in the UK, gilt yields saw a larger rally, with 10yr yields down -6.8bps to 4.67%. This came despite July CPI coming in slightly stronger than expected at +3.8% yoy for both headline and core inflation (vs +3.7% expected), which marked the highest headline reading since January 2024. A saving grace noted by our UK economist, Sanjay Raja, is that with the volatile transport and travel services components driving the upside, most core services metrics ticked down on the month (see Sanjay’s reaction here). Money markets moved to price in more BoE easing for early 2026 following the release, with the amount of cuts priced by next June rising +5.5bps to 38bps. The repricing in UK rates helped the FTSE 100 outperform (+1.01%). The Stoxx 600 rose +0.24% but continental indices were more subdued, with the CAC (+0.06%) posting a marginal gain but the DAX (-0.69%) and FTSE MIB (-0.36%) losing ground. Overnight, sentiment has turned risk-on again in most Asian equity markets. The KOSPI is up +0.73%, while the S&P/ASX 200 (+0.90%) is leading the way after a strong flash PMI print. Australia’s composite PMI rose from 53.8 to 54.9, and the manufacturing index reached a 35-month high of 52.9. Chinese stocks are also on the rise, with the CSI (+0.72%) and the Shanghai Composite (+0.33%) higher, though the Hang Seng (-0.10%) is lagging. Meanwhile, US equity futures on the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 are little changed after yesterday’s decline. The one Asian market defying the regional positive trend is Japan, with the Nikkei down -0.58%. That comes despite Japan’s composite PMI rising to a 6-month high of 51.9 in the August flash reading (up from 51.6 in July), as stabilization in manufacturing (49.9 vs 48.9 in July) has offset slowing services growth (52.7 vs 53.6 in July). However, long-end JGB yields are inching higher to new multi-decade highs ahead of the July inflation print tomorrow morning, with the 30-year yield up +0.7bps to 3.18%, a new all-time high since this tenor was introduced in 1999. To the day ahead, the main highlight will be the August flash PMI prints in Europe and the US. Other data releases include the August Philadelphia Fed business outlook, July existing home sales and weekly jobless claims in the US as well as August Eurozone consumer confidence. Earnings include Walmart, Intuit, and Workday. The Fed’s Bostic is due to speak, while the Kansas City Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium begins this evening with the main events on Friday and Saturday.

August 21, 2025 16:55 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses iRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in iRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

August 21, 2025 16:19 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the SelectQuote lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SLQT Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

Title: Longer Delay? AST SpaceMobile's FM1 Satellite Might Not Launch Until January

Don't miss out on our latest stories. Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google. Starlink rival AST SpaceMobile appears to be facing a longer-than-expected delay in launching its FM1 prototype satellite, which will provide cellular connectivity to smartphones. AST SpaceMobile has contracted India’s space agency, ISRO, to launch the FM1. It was originally supposed to happen this month and was later pushed to October/November. But on Thursday, the head of the space agency, V. Narayanan, indicated during a press conference that the satellite won’t fly until Q1 2026. "Most likely December-January time frame, this [launch] will be executed," Narayanan told local media outlet NDTV. The FM1 is important because it's the company's first stab at launching a massive satellite that's three times larger than AST’s first-generation BlueBird satellites. The increased size promises to boost the satellite’s capacity by 10 times, enabling it to serve more smartphones on the ground with better speeds. AST has partnered with AT&T and Verizon to eventually offer satellite connectivity to smartphones, putting it in direct competition with T-Mobile’s cellular Starlink service. AST has said it plans to kick off a “nationwide intermittent service in the United States” by year's end. But the delay at ISRO casts doubt on the company’s timeline, which has faced delays before. A year ago, the Texas-based company originally sought to launch the first second-generation BlueBirds in Q1 2025. To get the service working, the company needs to launch 45 to 60 satellites to deliver continuous coverage in the US when it currently only has five first-generation BlueBirds in orbit. "In the case of the US, when we get to around 45 [satellites], you get very close to a service that you can offer. And then as you get to 60, you are in full continuous service," AST CEO Abel Avellan said in a recent earnings call. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in its earnings presentation, the company said it anticipates “at least five orbital launches by [the] end of Q1 2026.” The FM1 is also supposed to ship to India this month. Avellan also indicated the FM1 wouldn’t hold back the company from launching other BlueBird satellites. “The other satellites are basically at the same few weeks after the FM1. So we are treating them separately. We're not conditioning any of the launches to any specific launch,” he said. This has raised speculation that AST will try to launch a separate second-generation BlueBird, known as the FM2, later this year. In addition to ISRO, the company has contracted SpaceX and Blue Origin to help it launch the satellites. The plan is to conduct launches “every one to two months on average to reach the goal of 45 to 60 satellites launched during 2025 and 2026,” AST says. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.

August 21, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Novo Nordisk and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until September 30, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk significantly lowered its sales outlook for 2025. The Company attributed the reduction to “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” On this news, Novo Nordisk’s American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) price fell $15.06 per ADR, or 21.83%, to close at $53.94 per ADR on July 29, 2025.

Title: Mutual Funds Bleed Another $432B as ETF Conversions Grow

The number of mutual funds being converted into ETFs in 2025 has already topped 30, the most since 2021. August 21, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Mutual funds are bleeding assets anew, just as their ETF cousins break fresh records. Now, firms from Lazard to Aberdeen Group Plc. are pushing to convert traditional funds into exchange-traded ones, even as regulators look poised to bless a structure that would allow both to coexist in peace. The number of mutual funds being converted into ETFs in 2025 has already topped 30, on pace for the most in data going back to 2021, according to figures compiled by State Street, which counted conversions still in process. It comes even as the asset-management industry awaits a groundbreaking regulatory change that would allow firms to add an exchange-traded fund share class onto their existing mutual funds, arguably negating the need to go all-in on just one wrapper. In the meantime, money managers have forged forward with their conversion plans. In 2024, mutual funds bled a net $451 billion, while their exchange-traded counterparts — which typically offer superior tax efficiency and liquidity — took in a record $1.1 trillion, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. So far in 2025, mutual funds have already lost $432 billion. ETFs, meanwhile, have seen inflows of more than $670 billion so far in 2025. Read more: Wall Street’s Rush to Launch Vanguard-Style Funds Draws Warnings Related:Morningstar: Active Funds Continue to Underperform Relative to Passive Options Instead of the brisk pace seen so far this year, State Street’s Frank Koudelka had “expected mutual-fund-to-ETF conversions to slow down because of the impending approval of ETF share class.” “I believe this is a result of most clients recognizing that some of its mutual funds simply make more sense as an ETF. Others have chosen not to wait for the regulatory approval of ETF share class,” said Koudelka, the firm’s global head of ETF solutions. More than 60 firms, including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp., are waiting for the regulator to sign off on the so-called multi-share class structure, which was made possible after Vanguard Group’s exclusive patent on the fund design expired two years ago. The steady pace of conversions also underscores Wall Street’s growing preference to package strategies of all stripes into ETFs instead of mutual funds, as the latter vehicle has seen net outflows for the past three years.

Title: The AI race is on. Google needs its engineers to keep up with the competition.

Good morning. I couldn't assemble flat-pack furniture if my life depended on it. Sometimes, it feels like it actually does. That's why I'm thrilled about this startup's mission: Make US manufacturing easier than following an Ikea manual. In today's big story, BI's Hugh Langley exclusively reports on Google ramping up the pressure on workers to use AI for everything — or risk falling behind. Googlers told Hugh how they feel about it. What's on deck: Markets: Infamous market bear Michael Burry appears to have flipped his stance on stocks. Tech: Hundreds of Microsoft employees are comparing compensation in a giant spreadsheet, BI exclusively reports. Business: Target's next CEO already has a plan to revive the retailer. But first, the competition is fierce. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. For Googlers, the message is clear: use AI to make yourself more productive — or get left behind. Some are excited about it, others are doing it grudgingly, one Google engineer told Hugh. Either way, their boss needs them to do it. Google is under pressure. In an all-hands meeting last month, CEO Sundar Pichai said that as rival companies leverage AI, Google needs to rise to the challenge if it wants to compete, employees who heard the remarks told BI. He's not wrong about the competition. Microsoft told workers in June that "using AI is no longer optional." In a frank blog post, GitHub's CEO said developers have a choice: embrace AI, or "get out of your career." The rivals are becoming lean, mean, and increasingly machine. These directives apply as much to the companies as to their workers. If they fall behind their competitors — as a worker may fall behind a colleague — they risk never catching up. The future of the software engineering profession will be a tale of the haves and have-nots. That's according to Meta's chief technology officer. "The engineers who master the tools to the point that they can't themselves be replaced by the tools command a premium," he said on Monday. Google seems to know this — and it's watching its engineers closely. Pichai said in June that engineers' weekly productivity hours are up 10% thanks to AI. Some companies are tracking employee AI use on a more granular level. Three providers of worker-tracking software told BI they've seen a sharp rise in demand over the past two years. Companies want their workers to use AI, and they aren't taking risks. It can be an unpleasant message to hear. Few people enjoy receiving instructions that come with stark warnings. That said, the Google employees who spoke with BI seem on board. "It seems like a no-brainer that you need to be using it to get ahead," one engineer told Hugh. In Google's internal message board, BI found more skeptical remarks: "You know a technology works and is great when you're forced to praise it to maintain your livelihood." In this race, it seems there is no medal for second place. In the end, there may only be the companies that kept up, and the ones that didn't. 1. JPMorgan's new HQ blurs the lines between work and life. The bank's new Midtown Manhattan office is filled with a luxury gym, a massive food hall, a 24/7 grab-and-go option, and more. Headhunters, consultants, and management experts told BI those wrap-around perks reinforce Wall Street's work-as-life culture, though. 2. Don't lose faith in major tech stocks. This week's sell-off is likely driven by anticipation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole on Friday, wealth manager Jeremy Hartle told BI. UBS said it's still confident in the sector despite the selling. 3. The "Big Short" investor seems to have done a 180. Michael Burry, one of the market's most famous bears, appears to have overhauled his stock portfolio, according to an update from his firm last week. He's swapping bearish puts for bullish calls, and is betting on ailing companies like Lululemon to execute a turnaround, portfolio gurus told BI. 1. How much Microsoft employees say they make. It's review season at the software giant, and employees are comparing notes on compensation in a large spreadsheet, BI's Ashley Stewart exclusively reports. With 850 entries and counting, here's what employees across cloud, AI, and other teams have said they earn in salary, stock, and bonuses. 2. Inside Meta's massive AI restructuring. Alexandr Wang, the leader of Meta Superintelligence Labs, announced the biggest reorganization of the company's AI operations in a memo sent to employees. Most team leaders will report to Wang, and the company will dissolve yet another major AI unit. 3. It's not just AI talent: Google is paying the big bucks for celebs. Google flexed its marketing might with a star-studded Pixel event, featuring cameos from "Call Her Daddy" podcaster Alex Cooper, NBA star Steph Curry, and more. The tech giant also announced a new partnership with Curry, who will serve as its "Performance Advisor" across its various products. 1. Sin City's sluggish summer. Las Vegas is in the middle of a vibe shift. Since gambling has expanded to other cities and consumers are starting to expect more high-end experiences, Vegas is losing some of its appeal to the more budget-conscious thrill-seekers. But it's not dead yet. 2. Target's new CEO has a plan to get the retailer back on track. In its earnings call, Target announced COO Michael Fiddelke will take over as CEO in February. Fiddelke, who spent the past quarter leading a new acceleration effort, laid out a three-part plan that he said is based on "knowing what makes Target Target." 3. TJX's secret weapon to keep prices low. As other retailers have started passing tariff costs onto consumers, the company behind T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods has been able to soften the blow and keep sales and profits strong. Its CEO credited TJX's price negotiation strategy and how well its buying and allocation teams work in tandem. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Meghan Morris, bureau chief, in Singapore.

Title: China Market Update: Kuaishou, Bilibili & Full Truck Beat, Tencent Releases Valorant

ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. Online video and social media company Kuaishou reported Q2 earnings after the close in Hong Kong, beating analyst expectations on revenue, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). Expectations were high going into the quarterly results due to the company’s Kling AI, which allows users to create AI-generated video content, having launched the Kling AI 2.1 model, which the company describes as “state-of-the-art (SOTA) large visual generation model technology”. Daily users hit an all-time high of 409 million in Q2 as average time spent on the Kuaishou app is 126.8 minutes, confirming the tool’s popularity. The company is monetizing this popularity through online marketing services, revenue from which increased +55.1% year-over-year (YoY) to RMB 19.77 billion, live streaming, revenue from which increased +30.1% to RMB 10.04 billion, and E-Commerce, which increased revenue by +14.8% to RMB 5.24 billion. Kuaishou’s all-time high is HKD 415, which it reached on February 17th, 2021, versus yesterday’s closing price of about HKD 72. Online video company Bilibili reported Q2 earnings after the close in Hong Kong, beating analyst expectations on revenue, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS. The company’s advertising revenues increased by +20% YoY to RMB 2.45 billion, while mobile game revenue increased +60% to RMB 1.61 billion. The company’s profitability trend continues. Daily average users increased 7% while the average daily time spent on the app is up 6 minutes to 105 minutes. The company bought 5,588,140 shares in Q2 for $100 million, bringing the buyback total to $6.4 million with another $83.6 million to buy. Bilibili’s all-time high $156.37 was reached on February 10, 2021, versus yesterday’s close of $25.30. Full Truck Alliance (YMM US), often called the Uber for truck drivers, a digital freight platform, reported after the Hong Kong close beating analyst expectations on revenue, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. The stellar earnings release was a positive sign for the company and the Chinese economy. Fulfilled orders increased +23.8% YoY to 60.8 million, and average monthly users increased +19.3% to 3.16 million. Full Truck’s all-time high is June 22, 2021, with the stock at $21.50 versus yesterday’s close of $11.01. I would be curious if the company touches on a potential Hong Kong listing during the conference call. Asian equity markets were mixed as the US dollar strengthened before Powell’s Friday press conference. Taiwan rebounded from yesterday’s hit as Australia and Vietnam outperformed. At the same time, the Philippines were closed for Ninoy Aquino Day, which commemorates the assassination of former Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. Hong Kong trading was mixed. Tencent gained +0.42% on the launch of its blockbuster mobile game Valorant, and NetEase gained +1.09%. Meanwhile, banks, telecom, and oil stocks all moved higher. On the downside, Alibaba fell -1.53%, despite spinning off its electric vehicle operating system unit Banma Network Technology, via a Hong Kong IPO, along with declines in Meituan, which fell -3.06%, Xiaomi, which fell -2.28%, BYD, which fell -1.76%, and CATL, which fell -0.2%. I guess that foreign investors are likely selling Hong Kong growth stocks while waiting for Powell’s guidance, though Mainland investors bought today’s dip via Southbound Stock Connect. Apple supplier AAC Technology was whacked -13.17% after stopping its dividend. The Hang Seng is a bit range-bound at the moment, as the 25,000 level is support while the 25,500 level is resistance. The only big story was Premier Li’s visit to healthcare companies and his voice of support for the industry, which led the sector to gain +2.61% in Hong Kong and +2.66% in Mainland China. Mainland China sold off on no news, as several recent outperformers sold off in afternoon trading. It was a pretty quiet night overall! Mainland brokerage stocks were off despite the Mainland media source 21st Century Business Herald’s article on Mainland investors opening new brokerage accounts and reactivating old brokerage accounts. The article didn’t provide numbers on the number of accounts opened, other than noting a strong month-on-month increase, though nothing it was similar to the brokerage opening boom following last September’s stimulus announcement. I’ll try to dig up the numbers and report back. The National Energy Administration reported that July electricity consumption increased by +8.6% as air conditioners got cranked. Having visited two of the largest commodity-producing countries in the last quarter, I’ve got a new theory: the best Chinese economists are the CEOs of commodity companies. A China demand pick-up is occurring, based on reading half a dozen commodity companies’ Q2 and CEO comments. We’ll be publishing the whole piece in a week or so. Here is a taste from BHP Group CEO Mike Henry from the August 19th Q2 financial results: "China exceeded economic growth expectations in the first half of this year, with strong export growth. We also saw robust domestic commodity demand from various sectors, including infrastructure and electrification, even as demand from the property sector remained subdued." China’s economic growth is expected to remain resilient, even as the pace moderates slightly in the second half as the boost from ‘pulled forward’ exports unwinds and new tariffs take effect. It has many policy levers to support its domestic economy, and its exports are likely to remain resilient due to its significant cost competitiveness.

Title: Pomerantz Law Firm Announces the Filing of a Class Action Against iRobot Corporation and Certain Officers – IRBT

August 21, 2025 10:12 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions.

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Palantir shares plunged more than 9% on Tuesday, extending the company’s losing streak to five consecutive trading days. The decline comes amid a broader slide in AI stocks, with industry leaders like NVIDIA and Meta also experiencing significant drops in their stock values. The downturn has erased much of Palantir’s strong gains from earlier in the month, following its latest earnings report where it topped Wall Street estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Since August 13, the company’s total decline has reached 15.5%. Palantir’s stock slump has been partly attributed to a critical report from Citron Research, which alleges the company’s stock is overvalued. The report suggests that if OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation metrics were applied to Palantir, the company’s shares would trade at $40, significantly lower than its current trading price. NVIDIA shares also took a hit, slipping by as much as 3% before market close, while Meta’s stock fell nearly 2% to $753.43 per share on Tuesday afternoon. This adds to a 3% drop in Meta’s share price on Monday. Overall, the Nasdaq experienced a 1.4% decline in midday trading. The decline in AI stocks isn’t an isolated event. Cryptocurrency stocks also tumbled on Tuesday, with Coinbase shares falling nearly 5%, Robinhood dropping more than 5%, and Bitcoin sliding 2.4%. Despite the recent downturn, Palantir reported robust earnings, with quarterly revenue surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, commented on the state of the AI sector last week, saying, “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” adding, “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” Despite recent struggles, 2025 has been a highly successful year for Palantir’s stock, which has surged 110% since the beginning of the year, starting at $75.19. The rise has been fueled by the company’s advancements in AI tools, which were pivotal in securing a $10 billion deal with the Army to consolidate 75 contracts. Palantir’s outlook remains optimistic; the company boosted its full-year revenue guidance, expecting earnings between $4.14 billion and $4.15 billion, up from its previous estimates of $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion. The company’s success aligns with the U.S. government’s push for greater AI and chip infrastructure, involving financial commitments from companies like NVIDIA and OpenAI. While Palantir and other AI stocks face short-term challenges, the sector’s long-term prospects remain strong, driven by continued technological advancements and strategic government support.

Title: Will AST SpaceMobile Stock Continue To Fly High?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/21/will-ast-spacemobile-stock-continue-to-fly-high/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AST SpaceMobile stock (NASDAQ:ASTS) has increased by about 4% in the past week and remains up more than 2x over the last year. The satellite design company is constructing a space-based cellular broadband network that connects directly to standard smartphones without requiring additional hardware. Its services are intended for both commercial use and government applications. In its Q2 2025 earnings update, the company stated that it had confirmed a strategy to launch 45 to 60 satellites into orbit by 2026 to support cellular-based broadband networks. The company aims for orbital launches every one to two months, on average, throughout 2025 and 2026, and indicated that the satellites are fully financed. Currently, AST operates six satellites in orbit and is set to introduce nationwide service in the U.S. by late 2025 through AT&T and Verizon, followed by expansion into the U.K., Japan, and Canada in early 2026. There is an ongoing competition to establish broadband services via satellites, with Elon Musk’s SpaceX currently in the lead, having over 8,000 Starlink satellites already in orbit. However, AST SpaceMobile’s strategy is distinct in several ways. While Starlink directly targets consumers by selling hardware and internet subscriptions, AST’s satellites are designed to operate like space-based cellular towers, directly integrating into the networks of existing mobile operators like AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, and Verizon. This approach enables users to access connectivity from these satellites using their regular smartphones and existing SIM cards. For carriers, this value proposition is significant. Collaborating with AST allows them to extend 4G and 5G coverage into deserts, oceans, mountains, and other under-served regions where traditional towers are not economically viable. This enables them to offer truly nationwide or even global coverage to customers. These advantages can enhance customer satisfaction and open up new revenue channels without carriers having to shoulder the hefty costs of rural infrastructure. Rather than marketing directly to consumers, AST generates revenue by charging carriers for access to its satellite capacity, with pricing based on usage or long-term contracts. This strategy could provide AST with a recurring, high-margin revenue model while establishing strong partnerships throughout the global telecom sector. Separately, wonder whether you should Buy Nvidia Stock Ahead of Earnings? With a market capitalization of approximately $16 billion, ASTS is trading at around 260x the consensus 2025 revenue estimates of $60 million. This represents a steep valuation considering the company is in its early operational stages. Nevertheless, growth has been swift, albeit from a small base, with revenues increasing by 249% over the last year to $4.9 million. See ASTS Revenue Comparison. Losses continue to be substantial, with operating losses reported at $260 million over the past 12 months. ASTS has performed significantly worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. In the 2022 inflation-driven market crash, ASTS stock plummeted 68.5% from a high of $22.50 on February 9, 2021, to $7.08 on June 1, 2021, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500. Read ASTS Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has rebounded from significant drops in the past. Nonetheless, the company boasts a robust balance sheet, with $924 million in cash and cash equivalents, a debt-to-equity ratio of just 4.3%, and cash comprising nearly half of its total assets. This financial flexibility should provide AST with the capacity to execute its satellite deployment strategy, though investors will need to be patient as the company transitions from technology rollout to commercial-scale revenue generation. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride overall, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 6 Top ETFs To Buy To Diversify Beyond The S&P 500
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-etfs-buy-diversify-beyond-sp500/
Time Published: 2025-08-21T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. An S&P 500 ETF may have been your first investing pick, but it shouldn’t be your last. While the large-cap S&P 500 index has made its share of millionaires, it is increasingly dominated by only a few companies. The top 10 S&P 500 stocks comprise nearly 38% of the index, while the remaining 62% is split among 490 companies. Diversifying outside the S&P 500 reduces concentration risk and provides other avenues of growth beyond Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). The funds introduced here can achieve both goals. Read on to meet the largest and most popular funds in market segments that have little to no overlap with the S&P 500. The table below identifies the six best ETFs to buy to diversify beyond the S&P 500. A closer review of each fund follows. Metrics for current share prices and distribution yields are sourced from stockanalysis.com. Returns, composition metrics, expense ratios and net asset values are from fund websites. IJR by the numbers: IJR invests in small-cap stocks, which have market capitalizations ranging from $250 million to $2 billion. The fund's largest industry exposures are financials (19.5%), industrials (19.3%) and consumer discretionary (13.9%). The top three holdings are loan servicer Mr. Cooper, aerospace technology provider Kratos Defense & Security and rare minerals producer MP Materials. IJR has zero overlap with the S&P 500. With 632 holdings, the fund is also well-diversified within the small-cap segment. Some analysts are bullish on small caps for 2025, citing appealing valuations, a positive regulatory environment and increasing merger and acquisition activity. Small caps are also likely to have lower tariff risk, since they normally focus on domestic business for growth. Small caps can be volatile, so most investors will not use IJR as a core fund. A reasonable starting allocation would be 5% to 15%. IJH by the numbers: IJH invests in mid-cap companies, which have market values of $2 billion to $10 billion. Similar to IJR, the portfolio favors industrials (23.7%), financials (18%) and consumer discretionary (13.3%) stocks. The top three holdings are digital investment broker Interactive Brokers Group, construction service provider Emcor Group and HVAC contractor Comfort Systems USA. None of the 404 stocks in the IJH portfolio are in the S&P 500. Information technology, the sector that dominates the S&P 500, comprises just 11.9% of IJH. The 2025 outlook for mid caps is also positive, for the same reasons small caps are poised to shine. However, mid caps are larger and more established than small caps. Their larger size may provide better business visibility, financial resilience and capital access relative to their smaller counterparts. A 5% to 15% allocation to mid caps is appropriate for many investors. You might lean to the higher side of the range if you decide to forgo small-cap exposure. VNQ by the numbers: Vanguard’s real estate ETF invests in real estate investment trusts (REIT). REITs are companies that own and manage real estate. They pay no corporate taxes and distribute 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. VNQ's primary exposures are to property owners in health care (13.7%), retail (13.2%) and telecom towers (11.50%). The top three holdings are Vanguard's institutional real estate fund VRTPX, senior housing operator Welltower and industrial property owner Prologis. Thirty-one of VNQ’s 160 holdings are in the S&P 500, including Welltower and Prologis. In terms of weight, the overlap is low. For example, Welltower is 6.1% of VNQ but only 0.2% of the S&P 500. REITs make their money on real estate values and rents, two values that generally hold up well in inflationary periods. So it’s not surprising that a 2022 analysis by industry group NAREIT concluded that REITs outperform the S&P 500 in high-inflation periods. This means VNQ exposure could partly offset the next inflation-related downturn in stocks. REITs should be a non-core holding with an allocation of 5% to 15%. VXUS by the numbers: VXUS invests in small-, mid- and large-cap stocks located outside the U.S., with exposure to Europe (39%), emerging markets (27.2%), the Pacific (25.4%) and North America (7.7%). The top holdings are chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor, online advertising and content company Tencent Holdings and enterprise software provider SAP. VXUS has no overlap with the S&P 500. Finance is the most heavily weighted sector in VXUS, while the S&P 500 is concentrated in technology. VXUS has outperformed S&P 500 ETFs this year, notching a 22.7% gain vs. 10.4% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Schwab is upbeat about international stocks for the remainder of 2025, partly due to their attractive valuations and weakness in the U.S. dollar. International stocks can comprise 20% to 30% of your portfolio. BND by the numbers: BND invests in taxable, investment-grade bonds issued in U.S. dollars. About 80% of the portfolio has maturities ranging from one to 10 years, and the portfolio may be moderately price-sensitive to interest rates. Bond types include Treasury securities (48.9%), government mortgage-backed securities (19.6%) and corporate industrial bonds (14.4%). BND provides broad exposure to the U.S. bond market, which can add stability and income to a portfolio otherwise focused on the S&P 500. Bonds can fluctuate in value, but they’re generally less reactive than stock prices. They can also move in the opposite direction of stocks, rising when investors sour on equities. The right bond allocation depends on your risk tolerance and investment goals. If your goal is to preserve your wealth—say, because you are retired—you might want 40% to 60% exposure to bonds. If you're young and interested in long-term growth, a 10% to 20% allocation is more appropriate. GLD by the numbers: GLD invests in physical gold bullion. Shareholders participate in gold spot price changes, less fund expenses, without having to buy, store and insure their own gold bars. Gold is a safe-haven asset that tends to appreciate during periods of high inflation and economic uncertainty—circumstances that often coincide with stock price declines. The precious metal has performed very well recently, increasing more than 35% over the last 12 months. Some analysts believe the run will continue. In June 2025, J.P. Morgan predicted gold’s price could reach $3,675 per ounce in the fourth quarter and nearly $4,000 in mid-2026. Gold futures contracts currently trade just below $3,400. According to State Street Global Advisors, 83% of advisors recommend a gold allocation of 10% or more. Surveyed high-net-worth investors had an average gold allocation of 21% in 2024. Bottom Line The S&P 500 has made headlines for its performance in recent years, but it's not the only game in town. Adding small- and mid-caps, international stocks, REITs, bonds or gold to your portfolio provides multiple pathways to growth, plus some cushion if large caps weaken.

Title: Interested In YieldMax ETFs? Here Are The 5 Best ETFs To Check Out
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/yieldmax-etfs-5-best-ones-to-check-out/
Time Published: 2025-08-21T11:00:00Z

ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Income-seeking investors continue hunting for yield in a market where traditional dividend stocks often fall short of expectations. Enter YieldMax ETFs—a unique breed of exchange-traded funds that use sophisticated options strategies to generate monthly distributions from high-profile growth stocks that typically don't pay dividends. These innovative funds have captured significant investor attention by promising attractive yields from companies like Tesla, Netflix and Meta. But with dozens of YieldMax offerings now available, selecting the right ones requires careful analysis of performance metrics, volatility patterns and income sustainability. This article examines five top YieldMax ETFs that deserve consideration for income-focused portfolios. YieldMax ETFs represent a specialized category of funds that seek to generate monthly income by pursuing options-based strategies on one or more underlying securities, without actually owning the underlying stocks. Instead of relying on traditional dividend payments, these funds employ synthetic covered call strategies combined with U.S. Treasury holdings to create income streams from volatile growth stocks. The strategy works by selling call options against positions that mirror the performance of popular stocks like Tesla or Amazon. When these options expire worthless or at lower values, the premiums collected become distributable income for shareholders. However, this approach comes with trade-offs—investors sacrifice unlimited upside potential in exchange for regular monthly distributions. YieldMax ETFs are designed to deliver an alternative source of income for dividend-seeking investors through a covered-call strategy, making them particularly appealing during periods when traditional income investments underperform. After analyzing performance data, asset size, yield sustainability and underlying security volatility, five YieldMax ETFs stand out as the most compelling options for income investors. This evaluation focused on funds with substantial assets under management, consistent distribution histories, and exposure to fundamentally strong underlying companies that generate sufficient option premiums. The selected funds represent different risk-reward profiles while maintaining YieldMax's core income-generation approach. Some offer more conservative yields with steadier performance, while others provide extreme income potential with correspondingly higher volatility. CONY has emerged as YieldMax's flagship fund with $1.4 billion in assets under management, making it the most extensive offering in the family. The fund targets Coinbase (COIN), capitalizing on the cryptocurrency exchange's notorious volatility to generate exceptional option premiums. With a staggering 127.73% forward yield, CONY offers income potential that dwarfs virtually all other investment options, though this comes with corresponding risks tied to crypto market fluctuations. Despite Coinbase's volatile nature, CONY has demonstrated relative stability in 2025 with a modest 1.4% year-to-date return. This performance suggests the fund's income strategy has successfully cushioned against some of the underlying stock's price swings, though investors should remember that crypto-related investments remain inherently unpredictable. The fund's substantial asset base indicates strong investor confidence and provides operational advantages through economies of scale. CONY's appeal lies in its ability to transform Coinbase's high implied volatility into consistent monthly income. While the triple-digit yield might seem unsustainable, it reflects the premium investors receive for accepting capped upside participation in one of the market's most volatile sectors. For income investors comfortable with crypto exposure, CONY represents an intriguing way to monetize volatility rather than simply enduring it. TSLY commands significant attention with $1.09 billion in assets under management, making it the second-largest YieldMax fund. The ETF focuses on Tesla (TSLA), one of the most actively traded and volatile stocks in the market. While Tesla's stock price movements have challenged the fund in 2025, resulting in a -19.5% year-to-date decline, TSLY continues generating substantial income with a 45.65% forward yield that provides meaningful compensation for price volatility. Tesla's position as an electric vehicle pioneer and its expansion into energy storage, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence create ongoing option premium opportunities. The stock's high implied volatility stems from its sensitivity to production updates, regulatory changes and CEO Elon Musk's public statements. This volatility, while creating principal risk, also generates the option premiums that fuel TSLY's distributions. Despite recent underperformance, TSLY remains relevant for investors seeking exposure to the electric vehicle revolution while generating monthly income. Tesla's long-term growth prospects in multiple high-growth sectors suggest that periods of volatility present opportunities rather than permanent impairments. For investors willing to accept Tesla's inherent unpredictability, TSLY offers a way to collect income while maintaining exposure to one of the market's most innovative companies. NFLY has delivered impressive performance in 2025, posting a 27.1% year-to-date return while maintaining a respectable 29.97% forward yield. The fund capitalizes on Netflix's position as a streaming industry leader, benefiting from the company's global expansion, content investment cycles, and subscriber growth announcements. Netflix's stock typically exhibits significant reactions to quarterly earnings reports and subscriber metrics, creating attractive option-writing opportunities. The streaming giant's volatility patterns make it well-suited for covered call strategies. Netflix often experiences sharp moves following earnings releases or major content announcements, allowing NFLY to capture premium from these price swings. The company's transition from a growth-focused model to one emphasizing profitability and free cash flow has created more predictable business patterns while maintaining enough volatility to support option strategies. NFLY's $176 million in assets under management, while smaller than CONY and TSLY, represents solid investor interest in the streaming sector's income potential. The fund offers exposure to the digital entertainment revolution while generating monthly distributions from an industry leader. For investors seeking balanced exposure to technology growth with meaningful income generation, NFLY presents an attractive middle ground between conservative and aggressive YieldMax offerings. AMZY targets Amazon (AMZN), providing income investors access to one of the world's most dominant technology companies while generating a substantial 50.45% forward yield. Amazon's diverse business model spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising and logistics creates multiple volatility drivers that support robust option premiums. The fund posted a solid 6.6% year-to-date return, demonstrating resilience despite broader market uncertainties. Amazon Web Services continues driving significant profit margins while the company's e-commerce operations benefit from ongoing digital transformation trends. The stock's sensitivity to cloud growth metrics, earnings surprises and macroeconomic factors creates regular option premium opportunities. AMZY's $282 million in assets reflects growing recognition of Amazon's suitability for income-generating strategies. The fund's appeal extends beyond its impressive yield to include exposure to Amazon's long-term secular growth themes. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence and digital advertising represent multi-trillion-dollar markets where Amazon maintains leading positions.

The fund offers exposure to next-generation computing platforms while generating meaningful monthly income from one of technology's most ambitious companies.

The five funds highlighted—CONY, TSLY, NFLY, AMZY, and FBY—represent the most established and liquid options in this specialized category, each offering different risk-reward profiles through exposure to leading technology and innovation companies. While these funds can generate impressive yields ranging from 30% to over 120%, investors must understand that high income comes with trade-offs, including capped upside participation and significant volatility risk. For income-focused investors comfortable with these dynamics, YieldMax ETFs provide an innovative way to harvest yield from some of the market's most dynamic companies.

Title: Interested In YieldMax ETFs? Here Are The 5 Best ETFs To Check Out

ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Income-seeking investors continue hunting for yield in a market where traditional dividend stocks often fall short of expectations. Enter YieldMax ETFs—a unique breed of exchange-traded funds that use sophisticated options strategies to generate monthly distributions from high-profile growth stocks that typically don't pay dividends. These innovative funds have captured significant investor attention by promising attractive yields from companies like Tesla, Netflix and Meta. But with dozens of YieldMax offerings now available, selecting the right ones requires careful analysis of performance metrics, volatility patterns and income sustainability. This article examines five top YieldMax ETFs that deserve consideration for income-focused portfolios. YieldMax ETFs represent a specialized category of funds that seek to generate monthly income by pursuing options-based strategies on one or more underlying securities, without actually owning the underlying stocks. Instead of relying on traditional dividend payments, these funds employ synthetic covered call strategies combined with U.S. Treasury holdings to create income streams from volatile growth stocks. The strategy works by selling call options against positions that mirror the performance of popular stocks like Tesla or Amazon. When these options expire worthless or at lower values, the premiums collected become distributable income for shareholders. However, this approach comes with trade-offs—investors sacrifice unlimited upside potential in exchange for regular monthly distributions. YieldMax ETFs are designed to deliver an alternative source of income for dividend-seeking investors through a covered-call strategy, making them particularly appealing during periods when traditional income investments underperform. After analyzing performance data, asset size, yield sustainability and underlying security volatility, five YieldMax ETFs stand out as the most compelling options for income investors. This evaluation focused on funds with substantial assets under management, consistent distribution histories, and exposure to fundamentally strong underlying companies that generate sufficient option premiums. The selected funds represent different risk-reward profiles while maintaining YieldMax's core income-generation approach. Some offer more conservative yields with steadier performance, while others provide extreme income potential with correspondingly higher volatility. CONY has emerged as YieldMax's flagship fund with $1.4 billion in assets under management, making it the most extensive offering in the family. The fund targets Coinbase (COIN), capitalizing on the cryptocurrency exchange's notorious volatility to generate exceptional option premiums. With a staggering 127.73% forward yield, CONY offers income potential that dwarfs virtually all other investment options, though this comes with corresponding risks tied to crypto market fluctuations. Despite Coinbase's volatile nature, CONY has demonstrated relative stability in 2025 with a modest 1.4% year-to-date return. This performance suggests the fund's income strategy has successfully cushioned against some of the underlying stock's price swings, though investors should remember that crypto-related investments remain inherently unpredictable. The fund's substantial asset base indicates strong investor confidence and provides operational advantages through economies of scale. CONY's appeal lies in its ability to transform Coinbase's high implied volatility into consistent monthly income. While the triple-digit yield might seem unsustainable, it reflects the premium investors receive for accepting capped upside participation in one of the market's most volatile sectors. For income investors comfortable with crypto exposure, CONY represents an intriguing way to monetize volatility rather than simply enduring it. TSLY commands significant attention with $1.09 billion in assets under management, making it the second-largest YieldMax fund. The ETF focuses on Tesla (TSLA), one of the most actively traded and volatile stocks in the market. While Tesla's stock price movements have challenged the fund in 2025, resulting in a -19.5% year-to-date decline, TSLY continues generating substantial income with a 45.65% forward yield that provides meaningful compensation for price volatility. Tesla's position as an electric vehicle pioneer and its expansion into energy storage, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence create ongoing option premium opportunities. The stock's high implied volatility stems from its sensitivity to production updates, regulatory changes and CEO Elon Musk's public statements. This volatility, while creating principal risk, also generates the option premiums that fuel TSLY's distributions. Despite recent underperformance, TSLY remains relevant for investors seeking exposure to the electric vehicle revolution while generating monthly income. Tesla's long-term growth prospects in multiple high-growth sectors suggest that periods of volatility present opportunities rather than permanent impairments. For investors willing to accept Tesla's inherent unpredictability, TSLY offers a way to collect income while maintaining exposure to one of the market's most innovative companies. NFLY has delivered impressive performance in 2025, posting a 27.1% year-to-date return while maintaining a respectable 29.97% forward yield. The fund capitalizes on Netflix's position as a streaming industry leader, benefiting from the company's global expansion, content investment cycles, and subscriber growth announcements. Netflix's stock typically exhibits significant reactions to quarterly earnings reports and subscriber metrics, creating attractive option-writing opportunities. The streaming giant's volatility patterns make it well-suited for covered call strategies. Netflix often experiences sharp moves following earnings releases or major content announcements, allowing NFLY to capture premium from these price swings. The company's transition from a growth-focused model to one emphasizing profitability and free cash flow has created more predictable business patterns while maintaining enough volatility to support option strategies. NFLY's $176 million in assets under management, while smaller than CONY and TSLY, represents solid investor interest in the streaming sector's income potential. The fund offers exposure to the digital entertainment revolution while generating monthly distributions from an industry leader. For investors seeking balanced exposure to technology growth with meaningful income generation, NFLY presents an attractive middle ground between conservative and aggressive YieldMax offerings. AMZY targets Amazon (AMZN), providing income investors access to one of the world's most dominant technology companies while generating a substantial 50.45% forward yield. Amazon's diverse business model spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising and logistics creates multiple volatility drivers that support robust option premiums. The fund posted a solid 6.6% year-to-date return, demonstrating resilience despite broader market uncertainties. Amazon Web Services continues driving significant profit margins while the company's e-commerce operations benefit from ongoing digital transformation trends. The stock's sensitivity to cloud growth metrics, earnings surprises and macroeconomic factors creates regular option premium opportunities. AMZY's $282 million in assets reflects growing recognition of Amazon's suitability for income-generating strategies. The fund's appeal extends beyond its impressive yield to include exposure to Amazon's long-term secular growth themes. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence and digital advertising represent multi-trillion-dollar markets where Amazon maintains leading positions. AMZY allows investors to participate in these growth trends while receiving substantial monthly distributions, creating a compelling combination for those seeking both income and growth potential from a single investment. FBY focuses on Meta Platforms (META), delivering strong 2025 performance with a 16.1% year-to-date return alongside a 34.06% forward yield. Meta's transformation from a social media company to a "metaverse" and artificial intelligence leader has created significant stock volatility, particularly around quarterly earnings and major product announcements. This volatility provides excellent raw material for FBY's covered call strategy.

Title: How Target let Walmart steal its rizz

Time Published: 2025-08-21T08:55:02Z
Full Content:
Phil Wahba is a senior writer at Fortune primarily focused on leadership coverage, with a prior focus on retail. Good morning. When Brian Cornell took the reins at Target 11 years ago, the retailer was, to put it mildly, a mess. Among its many problems: Target was struggling with out-of-stocks that frustrated shoppers, employee morale was low, and there was a sense that the retailer had lost much of the “Tar-zhay” cheap-chic magic that had won it millions of loyal, fanatical shoppers for decades. So it’s disappointing for fans to see that same shopping list of problems plaguing Target again. Sales have been in decline for three years now, and the stock has plunged 64% from its all-time high in 2022. It didn’t have to be this way. At the start of his tenure, Cornell, who the company announced yesterday will step down as CEO on February 1, was an outsider unafraid to move fast and break things. He had been CEO of a big PepsiCo unit, Michaels Stores, and Sam’s Club before that. As I detailed in a 2015 cover story, he quickly ended Target’s ill-advised Canada expansion to focus without distraction on a struggling U.S. business, assembled an A-team of merchants to re-energize Target’s store brands (for a while, Target was launching billion-dollar brands on a monthly basis) and changed Target’s insular culture. And in March 2017, in perhaps his boldest move, he announced a $7 billion multi-year program to remodel its physical stores, making them more inviting but also equipping them to support e-commerce pick up and delivery at a time investing in physical stores was seen as folly given Amazon’s ascendance. Wall Street pummeled the stock but Cornell had the last laugh. Target soared for years, building a huge digital business and taking market share from department stores. It was also well-positioned with its curbside pickup and improved grocery when the pandemic struck to be one of retail’s big winners alongside Walmart and Costco. Indeed, sales rose 20% in 2020 and the following year, revenue passed $100 billion for the first time. By that point, Cornell had been in the post for eight years, roughly the average tenure of a Fortune 500 CEO. But rather than hand on the baton, he signed on for another three years through 2025. Unfortunately, inertia set in. Shoppers felt Target lost its edge. Millions defected. Meanwhile, Walmart swooped in to take market share with its suddenly hipper apparel and home goods offerings. (The whole contretemps around DEI was also an unforced error that hurt morale.) Cornell had a great run overall, but like many CEOs, seems to have misjudged the moment when it’s time to move on. (And he’s not really going away—he will stay on as executive chairman indefinitely.) Though Wall Street had been hoping for an outsider to take the reins, Target’s COO Michael Fiddelke got the nod. He’ll have his work cut out for him. But perhaps the lesson here is, even successful CEOs have a shelf life.—Phil Wahba The Fed is more concerned about inflation than jobs U.S. Federal Reserve officials were more concerned about the inflationary impact of President Trump’s trade tariffs than signs of weakness in the job market, according to the minutes of their last meeting. The Fed meets at Jackson Hole today. Chair Jerome Powell will make a closely watched speech on Friday. Fed governor accused of mortgage fraud Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook was accused of mortgage fraud and referred for criminal prosecution by federal housing regulator Bill Pulte. He said she "has falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statutes." Cook is accused of taking out loans on properties in Michigan and Atlanta and claiming that both were her principal residence. Trump called on her to resign. Context: The Trump administration is trying to end the Fed’s economic independence and bring it under political control. Powell has also been referred for a criminal probe, baselessly, over his remarks to Congress. Meta reorganizes its “superintelligence” unit Meta is doubling down on its so-called race to “superintelligence,” reshuffling its AI organization once more as its new Meta Superintelligence Labs group takes shape. But analysts say investors are keeping their eye on the prize Meta has always promised: improved products that increase engagement and, in turn, sell more ads. Superintelligent AI models, if they arrive, are just a means to that end. Former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang is leading the reorganization. China moved against Nvidia after “insulting” remarks from Lutnick Regulators in China moved to restrict companies from buying Nvidia chips after they felt insulted by remarks on CNBC by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the FT reports. “We don’t sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best,” Lutnick said on July 15. “You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack, that’s the thinking.” Bed Bath & Beyond blasts California Bed Bath & Beyond won’t open stores in California because the state “has created one of the most overregulated, expensive and risky environments for businesses in America,” executive chairman Marcus Lemonis said in a statement. The chain went bankrupt in 2023 and closed all its stores, but is attempting a comeback under Kirkland’s Inc. It has opened a new store in Nashville. California officials were unfazed by Lemonis’s criticism. “Like most Americans, we thought Bed Bath & Beyond no longer existed,” the governor’s spokesperson said. The tide shifts in the labor market Managers offered up significant raises to keep employees around during the Great Resignation in the aftermath of the pandemic. Now they’re taking the power back with return-to-office policies and pay cuts. ‘Bubble’ worries hit Big Tech stocks Big Tech stocks fell sharply on Tuesday amid concerns of a potential AI bubble after a new MIT report found that nearly 95% of corporate generative AI pilot programs had “little to no” profit or revenue upside. Experts who spoke to Fortune, however, say this correction is expected and not necessarily indicative of a bubble. Sony raises console prices due to tariffs Sony announced that it will raise the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles to adjust for the Trump Administration's tariffs on electronics made in China. The company joins Microsoft and Nintendo, which have made similar price increases on their consoles this year. We’re not going to see those Epstein docs A federal court has ruled for a second time that transcripts and exhibits from the grand jury probe of Jeffrey Epstein will not be released because there are not "any special circumstances" to justify the move.

Title: Baidu’s Sales Slide Most Since 2022 in Fierce Chinese AI Contest

(Bloomberg) -- Baidu Inc.’s quarterly revenue fell its most in about three years, hurt by an economic downturn that’s capping its ability to fight bigger rivals in AI and make inroads in newer areas. The Ernie chatbot creator’s sales in the June quarter fell 4% to 32.7 billion yuan ($4.6 billion), weighed down by a slowdown in its core internet search operations. Net income rose 33%, versus projections for a decline, helped by a boost from long-term investments. The company’s US shares slid 2% in pre-market US trading. China’s internet search leader is betting big on generative AI to drive future growth, but it faces mounting pressure from open-sourced models like DeepSeek as well as a wave of AI-native apps encroaching on its turf. The company will continue to invest in artificial intelligence even as margins and revenue come under pressure in the near term, Chief Financial Officer Henry He said. That’s while its mainstay search business loses ground to social-video platforms like Xiaohongshu and TikTok’s Chinese twin Douyin. Online advertising revenue declined 15%. But non-marketing revenue grew a better-than-expected 34%, aided by demand for its cloud unit. “Since the AI search monetization is still in very early stages and has yet to scale, our revenue and margins are under considerable pressure in the near-term with Q3 expected to be especially challenging,” He said. “We see potential for margin improvement as our core advertising business recovers and stabilizes.” Baidu ADRs Dip as Results Show Revenue Drop: Street Wrap Baidu is counting on Ernie to underpin an AI ecosystem and drive demand for its cloud division, whose sales have grown by double-digits in recent quarters. It’s also accelerating an overseas push by its Apollo Go robotaxi service, through partnerships with Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. Baidu’s driverless rides in the June quarter more than doubled to 2.2 million, with cumulative rides passing 14 million in August, it said. Baidu plans to take its fleet of self-driving robotaxis — common in Beijing, Guangzhou and Wuhan — to Singapore and Malaysia as early as this year, Bloomberg reported. The company is now running trials in Hong Kong. But in China’s increasingly crowded AI arena, Baidu faces rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. — both with far more firepower and larger global footprints — as well as nimble upstarts. Baidu’s stock price is up around 6% this year, trailing both of the bigger internet leaders. “We are not yet at the stage for large-scale monetization,” co-founder Robin Li told analysts on a call. “While our AI transformation is progressing rapidly, it is still in the early stages, with considerable room for optimization before reaching its full potential.” Baidu’s Ernie was one of the first chatbots to launch in the world’s biggest internet arena, but it’s since lost ground to apps from ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent as well as open-sourced models like Alibaba’s Qwen. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says Baidu’s modest 2Q core top-line beat on rising AI cloud services demand came despite search engine ads falling 15% to 16.2 billion yuan, while adjusted operating income plunged 41% to 4.4 billion yuan. Margins were also pressured with gross margin missing forecasts by 120 bps, falling 780 bps annually to 43.9%, as the revenue mix shifted toward lower-margin cloud services. - Robert Lea and Jasmine Lyu, senior analyst Click here for the research. The company has had to abandon its paid subscription model as well as open-source its proprietary Ernie models. That’s as Baidu’s Netflix-style subsidiary iQiyi Inc. reported an 11% revenue drop. The embattled streaming platform is seeking to raise $300 million for a listing in Hong Kong this year, Bloomberg News has reported. --With assistance from Vlad Savov.

Also please note, in this August month’s trading, FIIs are net sellers to the tune of Rs 25380 crores. 2) Sticky US PPI inflation which was seen rising in the backdrop of slowing growth. 3) Nasdaq seen sliding on backdrop of massive profit booking amidst magnificent 7 companies which fell further on worries that valuations may have gone. # The Gyan Mantra: Stay light on any excessive intraday strength on Nifty. Makes sense to stay nimble. # The next big catalyst to watch: All eyes will be on the Jackson Hole Symposium, as the street will watch the speech by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell scheduled on August 22. # Bottom-line: Nifty may witness some mild profit booking amidst slight overbought technical conditions after the big bang GST reforms buzz. # Nifty View: The intraday/interweek risk shifts to neutral after last 5-days of spectacular gains with key supports to watch at Nifty’s 21-DMA at 24762 mark.

In July, the typical home sat on the market for 43 days—the slowest July pace in a decade—compared to just 16 days in July 2021. Pending home sales fell -1.1% MoM to their lowest since November 2023. Yet prices remain resilient, with the median sales price rising +1.4% YoY to a record July high of $443,867. Many homeowners are opting to rent or delay selling rather than accept lower offers, further tightening supply. In parallel, U.S. industrial policy is shifting. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is exploring the possibility of the government taking equity stakes in Intel and other chipmakers in exchange for grants under the CHIPS Act, which was designed to expand semiconductor manufacturing across the country. According to Lutnick, cash grants approved under the Biden administration could now be tied to equity participation. On trade, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced the U.S.’s hardline stance with China, stating he is “very happy” with the current arrangement. He highlighted that tariffs on Chinese goods remain at 50–55%, generating the largest share of tariff revenues, and dismissed the need for a renegotiated deal: “If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” Meanwhile, Beijing is weighing a major policy reversal by considering yuan-backed stablecoins to boost global adoption of its currency, signaling a softer approach toward digital assets. On the domestic front, India is eyeing tax relief and industrial reforms. The group of ministers (GoM) on health and life insurance is set to recommend exempting individual insurance premiums from GST, which currently attracts an 18% levy, according to Bihar Deputy CM and GoM convener Samrat Choudhary. Simultaneously, the government is evaluating new measures to strengthen manufacturing competitiveness amid U.S. tariff pressures. Proposals under discussion include interest subventions, new manufacturing clusters near infrastructure hubs, and incentives to attract private capital. On the trade front, India and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) comprising Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan signed terms of reference (ToR) on Wednesday to begin free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations. Bilateral trade reached $69 bn in 2024, up 7% YoY, and the pact is expected to unlock untapped potential, boost investment flows, and deepen economic ties. Finally, India’s core sector output showed modest growth of 2% in July, slightly below June’s 2.2%. Weakness in coal, crude oil, natural gas, and refinery products weighed on overall performance, though steel and cement output surged on the back of government capex and strong housing demand. Looking ahead, analysts expect growth to rebound to around 5% in August. Asian market Asia markets mostly rose as investors assessed the four-day losing streak for the S&P 500, led by declines in tech stocks.

(Analysis by Barclays) The minutes of the August RBI MPC meeting suggest that the members found it prudent to pause amid heightened global uncertainty and keep space should the drag on growth amid unfolding trade and tariff talks become more visible. [ On Wedneday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released the minutes of the August Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, at which it decided unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 5.5% and the monetary policy stance at “neutral.” ] While the external members of the MPC were mostly dovish, RBI internal MPC members were relatively neutral. Below are the three key takeaways from the minutes: 1) Heightened global uncertainty around tariffs and particularly the protracted India-US trade talks were widely cited as a key monitorable. The evolution of these risks would determine policy space and guide the policy path in upcoming meetings. 2) The very welcome and sharper-than-expected CPI disinflation resulted in a sizable downward revision to the CPI forecast by the RBI. It emanated largely from lower food inflation, which is known to be volatile. This concentrated disinflation lessens the RBI’s confidence around its durability. Accordingly, rather firm core CPI inflation and 4% + forecasts for H1 2026 weighed on their decision making, making a strong case for a pause. 3) All the members lauded the pace of transmission but acknowledged that it was best to wait and see how this permeates to the real economy, given the sizable and front-loaded 100bp repo rate cut.

Vikram Jeet Singh, Partner at BTG Advaya “The Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 was tabled in Parliament today. This bill seeks to ban “online money gaming”, which is the “depositing of money” for “winning money or other stakes”. This impacts games such as rummy, poker, etc., where winning money is possible. Under Indian law games of skill are legal, and games of chance are considered gambling and prohibited. Wagering money on games of skill was legal until now. The bill in Parliament follows a regulatory trend against RMG even in games of skill – the Madras High Court in June 2025 had upheld restrictions on Real Money Games in Tamil Nadu. Now, pursuant to these new regulations, even games of skill that involve real money can be banned. Advertising RMG will be prohibited and promoting this may lead to sanction for advertisers as well. One reason that has been suggested for this ban is the alleged use of RMG for money laundering activities. India’s online gaming market is valued at almost USD 4 billion, which will take a hit following from this - banning RMG may also have an impact on people employed in the gaming sector. Gaming companies have been subject to a 28% GST levy, in the past. But the bill indicates a move from regulating to banning, when it comes to RMG.” “ We appreciate the government’s suggestion to abolish GST on life and health insurance premiums, as this progressive step will render protection solutions much more affordable and accessible to millions of Indians. Insurance is not just a product, it is an essential safety net that enables people and families to face life with confidence. By abolishing the GST tax, the government has made a customer-centric move that will induce more families, particularly from middle-class and underprivileged sections, to get themselves covered with the proper insurance. This change is also part of the overall dream of ‘Insurance for All’ by 2047, driving greater penetration in urban and rural India. Affordability is a major driver, but we also think it is essential that we tackle some of the structural issues like the inverted duty structure that still affects industry efficiency and margins. A balanced” Godrej Properties Ltd. (GPL), (BSE scrip id: GODREJPROP), one of India’s leading real estate developers, today announced that it has participated in an e-auction conducted by the Telangana Housing Board (TGHB) for Residential Group Housing, where GPL has emerged as the highest bidder for ~ 7.825 acre land parcel in Kukatpally (KPHB), Hyderabad, with a total combined bid value of INR 547.75 crore, according to the bid status intimation email issued by e-auction facilitator MSTC Limited. TGHB shall issue the allotment letter after following the due process. The land parcel is strategically located in a prime location in Kukatpally, in close proximity to HITEC City, and will offer an estimated revenue potential of ~INR 3,800 crore* comprising premium residential apartments of varied configurations. This acquisition builds on the success of GPL’s recent launches in Hyderabad, including Godrej Madison Avenue at Kokapet and Godrej Regal Pavilion at Rajendranagar. With this new project, GPL has further strengthened its presence in one of India’s most dynamic real estate markets. Kukatpally is recognized as one of Hyderabad’s most established and resilient residential corridors. The neighbourhood has set benchmarks for premium housing and is supported by a robust social ecosystem comprising reputed educational institutions, healthcare facilities, retail, and commercial hubs. Its connectivity to HITEC City, one of Hyderabad’s largest employment centers, further enhances its residential appeal. Gaurav Pandey, MD & CEO, Godrej Properties, said, “As Hyderabad continues to strengthen its position as a dynamic real estate market, Kukatpally represents a strategic location that aligns with the city’s growth trajectory.

This milestone reflects a remarkable 460% stock rally since its IPO in 2021 at ₹116 per share, cementing its status as a new-age powerhouse. Apple is reportedly set to manufacture all four iPhone 17 models (iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max) in India for the US market before their September 2025 launch. This marks the first time Apple will produce all new iPhone variants, including the Pro models, in India from the outset. The production is spread across five factories, including new plants operated by Tata Group in Tamil Nadu and Foxconn near Bengaluru. This shift is part of Apple’s strategy to reduce reliance on China due to geopolitical tensions and tariff risks, with Tata expected to handle nearly half of India’s iPhone output within two years. iPhone exports from India reached $7.5 billion from April to July 2025, reflecting the country’s growing role as a manufacturing hub. According to ICRA, India’s GDP growth for Q1 FY2026 (April-June 2025) is projected at 6.7%, surpassing the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) estimate of 6.5%. However, this growth is lower than the 7.4% recorded in Q4 FY2025. The Gross Value Added (GVA) is expected to ease to 6.4% from 6.8% in the previous quarter. The services sector is anticipated to drive growth, reaching an eight-quarter high of 8.3%, up from 7.3%, supported by robust government spending. Central government capital expenditure surged 52% year-on-year to ₹2.8 trillion, and non-interest revenue expenditure grew by 6.9%. The combined non-interest revenue expenditure of 24 state governments also rose by 10.7%. However, industrial growth is projected to slow to 4.0% from 6.5%, and agriculture to 4.5% from 5.4%, though it remains strong compared to 1.5% in Q1 FY2025. Net indirect taxes are expected to grow in double digits, driven by an 11.3% increase in government indirect taxes, though subsidy contraction slowed to 7.3%. The gap between GDP and GVA growth is projected at 30 basis points, down from 62 in Q4 FY2025. New project announcements nearly doubled to ₹5.8 trillion, and project completions reached ₹2.3 trillion. ICRA notes that improved monetary easing and GST rationalization could boost urban consumption ahead of the festive season, but tariff uncertainties may limit GDP growth to 6.0% for FY2026.
