Title: World of Warcraft's in-game anniversary event could've been a joyous celebration of the last 20 years, but instead it's a disappointing grind

The anniversary event is full of sound and fury, thus far signifying no thing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The 20th anniversary of World of Warcraft deserves an epic event: a celebration of the world's most successful MMO, one that has transcended generations. Instead, it's a jumbled mess of nostalgia with no clear throughline and a grind to earn anything fun. Let me start by announcing my bias: I adore Warcraft. I've been writing about it since six months before the game's release, and despite its many flaws, I've largely stuck with it nearly continuously since then. I was absolutely looking forward to the celebration of the anniversary, certain that truly legendary gameplay was in store. Instead, what I got was a mishmash of unrelated celebration, connected only by a grind that locks away any interesting items. Most of the rewards for the event—some really nice high-resolution retro cosmetic armor sets, toys, weapons, and pets—are earned by collecting frustratingly scarce Bronze Celebration Tokens, which are available to some degree by playing other activities in the game and partially from anniversary events themselves. We've had Timewalking dungeons and raids before, even without an anniversary event. Blizzard massively buffed the amount of tokens that drop after the celebration had been out only a week, but it still feels like it's not enough; particularly because the anniversary events themselves are a bit of a yawn. One of the easiest ways to complete a weekly quest for tokens, for example, involves turning yourself into your pet, jumping into a basket… and sitting there for a full minute while a counter slowly ticks up. Various iconic raid bosses are now dotted about the landscape, waiting patiently to be killed by groups that rarely come. You can show off your transmog armor sets or your mount collection, turn into your favorite raid boss or your favorite pet, and watch (and participate in) the reenactment of crucial events from the game. The biggest new offerings feel like an extension of previous Timewalking events: a new raid, based on the overly-long Blackrock Depths dungeon from vanilla WoW; and new scaled-up vanilla Timewalking dungeons, including Deadmines and Dire Maul. These are fun because they're new, if initially over-tuned. The raid in particular has required a series of nerfs to be playable by random groups. (A group from my Mythic raid-clearing guild struggled with the later bosses of Heroic difficulty BRD when it first launched.) But even those instances don't feel overly special, because we've had Timewalking dungeons and raids before, even without an anniversary event. The Korrak's Revenge PvP event is a returning feature, and the stalls and vendors at the anniversary area in Tanaris are fairly similar to the stalls and vendors from previous anniversary events—which weren't as dramatic as this one should be. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I love transmog. I love pets and mounts and toys. I ground through every level of the PvP Plunderstorm event last spring—even though I despise fighting other players—to get those cosmetic rewards. I played Pandaria Remix until I had fully leveled a dozen new alts just to buy every available mount, appearance, and toy. I should be all over this event trying to earn everything, and yet it's been a struggle just to play through it all to write this piece. It's not the rewards—they're lovely. Tier 2 was a glorious era for Warcraft raid armor, and the high resolution versions are very pretty. I want them all. The meta-achievement blue phoenix for the event, while nothing like the iconic Ashes of A'lar mount Blizzard shamelessly compares it to, is still beautiful. (It's not the skeleton, my artist friends, that makes players love the Ashes, it's those wildly over-the-top glittery streamers as you fly.) The new armor appearances modeled after Blizzard employee rewards are a nice touch, rewarding players in a similar way for loyalty, and they’re attractive to boot. Did it have to feel this way? Absolutely not. But every single one of them requires a grind. In previous anniversaries, I got something just for logging in. This year, there were no free items. Even the typical reputation and experience buff requires a quest to unlock every few days, albeit an easy one. Token rewards drop eight at a time from significant weekly activities, but you need 60 to buy your first armor set. The cost lowers over time, but you don't get any for free. It would be like telling a Blizzard employee they get that cool sword or shield as a loyalty reward—but only if they put in 60 hours of overtime. Will I grind all those nifty appearances and rewards at some point before the event expires on January 6? Yes, begrudingly. Partially by doing content I don't care for, and partially by picking my way through the jumbled smorgasbord of activities that are fun but meaningless in combination. Did it have to feel this way? Absolutely not. Mindlessly grinding for currency is one of the least enjoyable aspects of Warcraft, and it's part of what brings down these anniversary events. The lack of any real incentive to do any particular event, since they all offer largely interchangeable rewards of that currency, doesn't help. (I am not the only person to feel this way.) The meta-achievement that rewards the Coldflame Tempest phoenix mount is a step in the right direction. It at least asks you to try everything out, which is a good reason to do everything once. But what if the entire event had been structured that way? What if the event was just a series of 20 achievements (or 30, if you wanted to represent the 30-year anniversary of the Warcraft universe)? Each achievement could bestow one of the nifty rewards, and lead to the next. You could even take the additional step of adding story quests for each. If it were more linear, it could feel like a grand adventure, from start to finish, a combination of battle and exploration and dungeoneering and showing off, instead of all of those things thrown into a messy catch-all basket with a ‘for sale for 60 tokens’ sign thrown on top. I'm honestly fine with having to grind for the other armor sets for other classes, but the first one should be my reward for participating, not grinding.Perhaps the game could even give me a terrific, engrossing story to go with my achievements too. Clearly, there were writers involved in this project; getting them together as a team and making this a real questline would have gone a long way toward hyping up this event. What about an epic achievement-wrapping mini-film from Blizzard's terrific cinematics team? It's insulting when the trailer announcing the 30th anniversary Warcraft Direct broadcast or the announcement of the 15th anniversary and the release of Warcraft Classic feel more inspiring than your 20th anniversary celebration. The most promising part of the entire event is another not-new feature: a secret-finding exploration (similar to the Secrets of Azeroth event in Dragonflight), which is still underway. There are precious few new rewards from this series if you did the last one. But at least one heart-tugging appearance of an old character has occurred thus far, and I have hopes for more.The celebration is hardly over. But so far, the 20th anniversary event has sadly been reduced to just another grind. World of Warcraft might not have invented the wheel, but it certainly made it popular—and 20 years on, the MMO titan has fundamentally changed gaming's DNA After 'regrets and lessons learned,' and 2 months of tuning, Blizzard is 'happy' with Delves as WoW's newest endgame destination It's not quite the end-of-generation sale price I've been holding out for but an RTX 4070 for a penny under $500 isn't too bad PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.97%) hit a new 52-week low on Thursday morning as the AI-focused hardware company struggles with filing its quarterly report (Form 10-Q) for the period ending September 30. The San Jose-based company notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of the delay in a recent filing, saying it needs more time to select and engage a new accounting firm to review financial statements for fiscal 2024. Having already missed the deadline for its 2024 Form 10-K or annual report, Super Micro faces a potential Nasdaq delisting. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq (NDAQ+0.58%) to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. On Thursday morning, the company’s stock was trading at $18, down more than 7%. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 85%, erasing over $55 billion in value. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. The stock has thrived for much of this year and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA-4.19%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. More recently, the server company’s auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The departure follows months of disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. After these events, Super Micro’s stock price experienced a significant decline, dropping 33% so far in 2024 and 35% over the past 12 months.

In the wake of recent global market shifts, including a notable rally in U.S. stocks driven by expectations of economic growth and tax reforms, investors are keenly observing how these changes might influence their portfolios.

Title: New BusConnects routes pushed back until January due to risk of Christmas confusion

New BusConnects services which were due to come into effect in December have been deferred until January, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has announced. The NTA said introducing the changes in the run up to Christmas may have caused confusion among bus passengers. They were originally planned to be implemented on December 8th. The routes affected include two 24-hour, cross-city “spine” routes E1 and E2. These routes are to areas including Bray, Dublin city centre, Ballymun and Santry. Radial 19, a route running between Dublin Airport, DCU and Parnell Square is also affected, as are routes X1 and X2 from Kilcoole, Co Wicklow, to the city centre, and Newcastle, Co Wicklow, to the city centre respectively. A series of L routes serving Bray, north Wicklow and South Dublin are also affected: Together the routes form Phase 6A of the wider BusConnects project. The exact revised implementation date for Phase 6A in January has yet to be announced. A spokesman for the NTA said “we believe that the short-term disruption that the changes would involve for some customers would be an unwelcome complication in the run-up to Christmas”. “The rescheduling of Phase 6A will free up resources, allowing additional bus services, including additional night services, to operate over the Christmas period. “This will contribute to the city centre promotional campaign planned by Dublin City Council and businesses, and will support the retail and hospitality sector in the city and suburbs during the busy December period.” Tim O'Brien is an Irish Times journalist © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has seen over $3 billion of inflows over the past five days. According to data from Farside Investors, on November 7 BlackRock’s fund saw $1.119 billion inflows, while on the following day its inflows topped the $206 million mark. At the start of this week, the fund saw $756.5 million coming in, while on November 12 it brought in $778.3 million. On November 13, IBIT saw $230.8 million inflows. In total, the fund saw over $3 billion inflows, at a time in which cryptocurrency prices were surging. Over the past week, BTC’s rise rose 21.1% to now trade at $90,700, down from a new all-time high around $93,000. As CryptoGlobe reported, the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the United States earlier this year have seen their total assets cross the $90 billion mark after seeing a $6 billion ump in a single day, and are now over three-thirds of the way of surpassing gold ETFs in assets. That’s according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) pointed out that spot Bitcoin ETFs’ $6 billion jump in a day came with $1 billion of inflows, and $5 billion of market appreciation amid a significant BTC price rise. According to Farside Investors’ data, spot Bitcoin ETFs’ total cumulative flow is at $28.3 billion. Notably, cryptocurrency investment products have also been seeing significant inflows, bringing in $1.98 billion in the week after Republican candidate Donald Trump won the US presidential elections. According to CoinShares latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, the inflows couple with the cryptocurrency market rally have pushed the total assets under management of crypto investment products to a $116 billion high. The report details that Bitcoin-focused investment products saw $1.79 billion inflows over the past week, while Ethereum-focused products saw $157 million inflows. Featured image via Pexels.

Title: Trump’s Planned Immigrant Purge Sends Stagnant Private Prison Stocks Soaring
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/trump-immigration-purge-private-prison
Time Published: 2024-11-14T15:00:00Z

Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by Common Dreams. The chairperson of a leading U.S. private prison corporation last week gushed over the ​“unprecedented opportunity” presented by the prospect of Republican President-elect Donald Trump delivering on his campaign promise to begin the mass deportation of unauthorized immigrants on his first day in office. As Common Dreams reported, Trump’s campaign confirmed that ​“the largest mass deportation operation of illegal immigrants” ever is set to start immediately after the former president returns to the White House on January 20. GEO Group stock surged more than 56% from the close of trading on Tuesday, Election Day, to Friday’s closing bell. Competitor CoreCivic shares skyrocketed 57% over the same period. By contrast, GEO Group stock saw just a 21% rise in the three months preceding Election Day. CoreCivic inched up just 11% over the same period. “The GEO Group was built for this unique moment in our company’s [and] country’s history, and the opportunity that it will bring,” GEO Group founder and chairperson George Zoley said during an earnings call in which he hailed the ​“unprecedented opportunity” ahead, according to a company statement and coverage by HuffPost. 💰📈Trump’s mass deportation plan has private prison stocks skyrocketing on the prospect of highly profitable internment camps — including @GovBillLee’s pals over @CoreCivic 🫤 pic.twitter.com/nq6XKxwWcd “While our third-quarter results were below our expectations due to lower-than-expected revenues in our electronic monitoring and supervision services segment, we believe we have several potential sources of upside to our current quarterly run rate, with possible future growth opportunities across our diversified services platform,” Zoley continued. “We have 18,000 available beds across contracted and idle secure services facilities, which if fully activated, would provide significant potential upside to our financial performance,” he noted. ​“We also believe we have the necessary resources to materially scale up the service levels in our [Intensive Supervision Appearance Program] and air and ground transportation contracts.” Zoley added that ​“as we evaluate and pursue future growth opportunities, we remain focused on the disciplined allocation of capital to further reduce our debt, deleverage our balance sheet, and position our company to evaluate options to return capital to shareholders in the future.” According to a study published last month by the American Immigration Council, deporting the estimated 13.3 million people in the U.S. without authorization in one massive sweep would cost around $315 billion, while expelling 1 million undocumented immigrants per year would cost nearly $1 trillion cumulatively over a decade. Last Thursday, Trump insisted ​“there is no price tag” on his deportation plan. He dismissed concerns that such an operation would require the use of concentration camps like the mass detention centers — which one Trump official euphemistically compared with ​“summer camp” — of his first administration. The private prison industry has also thrived during the Biden administration, which is on pace to match the 1.5 million people deported during Trump’s previous presidency. Although President Joe Biden signed an executive order ​“on reforming our incarceration system to eliminate the use of privately operated criminal detention facilities” early during his tenure, the directive did not apply to detainees in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. The number of immigrants detained by the Biden administration doubled between 2021 and 2023. In July 2023, more than 90% of immigrants detained by ICE each day were locked up in private facilities. In January 2020, the last month of Trump’s first term, 81% of daily detainees were held in private lockups. In 2022 a bipartisan U.S. Senate probe corroborated allegations of staff abuse against migrants jailed at facilities owned by LaSalle, a private prison company that claims to be ​“run with family values.” Whistleblowers and others have also revealed abuses from torture and medical neglect to sexual assault of children and forced sterilizations at privately run immigration detention centers.

Title: The Apple deals you should grab this Black Friday are all right here

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, or anything else, there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—possibly the lowest ever. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). However, we’re already seeing fantastic deals, so you might not want to wait. We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in and as soon as Apple announces its own Black Friday 2024 shopping event. Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM even if it’s $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Grab money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are big savings are on the older models as well: U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds. Apple updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday. You may also see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is to spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models: Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. U.S. U.K. Foundry Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. U.S. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. U.K. David Price / Foundry In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks, but in 2023 the Apple Watch Series 9 was included. In 2023 you could get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals: If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops: Check out these Lightning tech deals before they go.

Title: 'Trees don’t grow to the sky': Nelson Peltz says the stock market's Trump 'euphoria' won't last

The stock market has been on a record-setting hot streak since Donald Trump won the White House last week. But billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz doesn’t think it will last. “No, trees don’t grow to the sky. Definitely not uninterrupted,” the Trian Partners founder said in an interview at CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference. “There will be something that might upset it. I think you’ve got euphoria from the election.” Major stock indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq, all hit record highs in the days following Trump’s election win. These gains slowed Wednesday, with the Dow ending the day up just 0.11%, or about 47 points, the S&P 500 closing up 0.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling roughly 0.26%. Beyond the election-driven excitement, Peltz pointed to the high concentration of companies that currently drive the market. “You’ve got the S&P 500, and then you’ve got the S&P 20-25,” he said. “You’ve got two different markets. It’s the wrong name. You’ve got these 20 companies that are swinging the cat around the room. And then you’ve got these other companies.” That echoed observations from researchers at Goldman Sachs (GS+0.39%), who have warned that the era of double-digit gains in the stock market may be coming to an end. The strategists estimate that the S&P 500 will deliver an annualized return of 3% over the next decade — well below the 13% returns of the last 10 years and the long-term average of 11%. While they attributed much of that downward revision to a higher starting point going into the next decade, another major factor fueling uncertainty is an “extremely high level of market concentration,” particularly when it comes to the 10 largest mega-cap tech stocks, the strategists said. These top 10 companies — which include Apple (AAPL-1.61%), Microsoft (MSFT-2.82%), Amazon (AMZN-5.22%), Nvidia (NVDA-4.19%), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL-2.45%), and Meta (META-4.22%) — account for 36% of the overall index and are driving much of the returns. So far this year, these leading firms have returned almost 43%, compared with 36% for the index as a whole. Goldman said its forecast would be roughly 4 percentage points higher (7% instead of 3%) if the market were not so concentrated, with a baseline range of 3% to 11% growth instead of a possible -1% to 7% over the next decade.

Title: Both men and women will switch jobs for higher pay—but what it takes to keep them is different for each group

Good morning! Employers right now may have the upper hand when it comes to hiring, but many employees are still eyeing the exit. That means that business leaders and HR managers still have to think hard about ways to engage their workforces—but not every group is motivated by the same perks. Overall, about 54% of employees have no plans to leave their current company or role in 2024—a slight uptick from 52% in 2023, according to a new report from Alight, a consulting technology company. But the top motivators to stay are different for men and women. Around 21% of women rank satisfaction with their work-life flexibility as the main reason they’re sticking around. Meanwhile, only 10% of men surveyed said the same. Yet 13% of both women and men listed job or company stability as their main motivator, signaling security is a priority all around. “It’s important to understand your retention and attraction efforts as an employer should be different. It’s not one-size-fits-all,” Laine Thomas Conway, VP of engagement services strategy at Alight, tells Fortune. When it comes to what would make a worker consider a new job with another company, women and men are generally in agreement: higher pay. But the topic is even more important for women, with around 46% ranking higher wages as the primary reason they would leave, compared to 39% of men, according to the report. “When we’re looking at job stability and jumping for pay, it’s really important to know that women feel much more challenged about their budgets and savings, and that they definitely need more help,” Thomas Conway says. “Employers [need to] make sure that they are promoting the tools that are going to make women feel more confident in their futures, in their day-to-day budgeting, and how they are navigating the world.” Emma Burleigh emma.burleigh@fortune.com Today’s edition was curated by Brit Morse.

Title: The Influencers Going Viral in Aisle 8
URL: https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a62671359/tiktok-trend-luxury-supermarket-hauls/
Time Published: 2024-11-14T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
With young people in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis, TikTok creators are turning grocery runs into rich-girl-coded productions—and followers are eating it up. I’m sitting in a Costco parking lot, staring at my Instacart app. It’s my ﬁrst week as a shopper, and all morning long, I’ve been at supermarkets in the sprawling, affluent community of Summerlin, Nevada, locations where the algorithm has detected a high likelihood that a customer will enlist my services. Except no one has, which means I’m currently making less than the $22 I spent on the insulated grocery bag Instacart recommended as part of its “best practices.” I have 18 miles of gas left. Anxiety is starting to kick in. I open TikTok and type “Instacart how to get orders”—and instead get my first taste of a genre that will ultimately suck me in for weeks. The initial video I stumble on shows a young woman named Shelly Kowatch in skintight workout gear surrounded by groceries in her kitchen. She and her husband “fucked up real bad,” she explains, holding up a large cardboard box of items, and blew $737.14 on a single Costco trip. With naughty delight, she displays the items one by one: frozen açaí packs, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, a whole watermelon, yogurt tubes, a jumbo pack of cream cheese, guacamole packs, and on and on. “There’s so much shit, I can’t even keep it organized right now,” she says. I’m at once mesmerized and unsettled, because what should be the blandest of content—a trip to Costco, the decidedly unglamorous warehouse club known for its discounted prices—is suddenly pinging my lifestyle envy. I skim the video’s 668 comments and see I’m not alone. “How do you afford thisss,” one viewer writes, adding two crying-face emojis. Another chimes in, “My broke ass couldn’t.” Says someone else, “I hope I can eventually be at the point where I accidentally spend $700 at Costco.” And that’s when I get it: It’s not the store itself that feels so seductive; it’s the idea of being able to stock up at all. In this economy? As a grad student in Las Vegas (and with Nevada having the country’s fourth-highest household grocery costs), I can attest it’s become very difficult to put food on the table with the $30,000 annual stipend I get for teaching and other academic duties. Hence my Instacart gig—and my insta-fascination with this budding corner of TikTok. Soon, through hashtags like #SupermarketHaul and #LuxuryGroceries, I’m scrolling through thousands of videos geared toward evoking a strange yearning. Some are like that first one, almost normcore in their casual redefinition of excess. Others catapult viewers across the ever-expanding wealth divide into an otherworldly domain where you can (vicariously) spend $88 on edible sea moss gel. But all these young female influencers cruising the aisles with nary a care underline a unifying truth: For a lot of us, the act of buying the exact foods we like, of nourishing ourselves on our own terms, now feels like an increasingly rarefied one. Back in that parking lot, my Instacart finally buzzes with an order. A customer has purchased a single rotisserie chicken…and nothing more. I’ll earn just $14 for delivering it, but I don’t feel I have much choice. I go inside, pick up the bird, and drive 40 minutes to a neighborhood almost 20 miles away. As instructed, I leave the bag outside a beautiful stucco house. I spend my $14 on gas, go home, lie on the floor, and watch more grocery content. People have always been obsessed with how the “haves” spend their money, a spectator sport driven by fascination, envy, sometimes bitterness. As a millennial raised on the internet, I’ve been watching luxury unboxings since the dawn of YouTube influencer culture: Sephora outings with unlimited budgets, ribbon-tied packages from Hermès—videos that served viewers like myself a thrilling peek at devil-may-care consumption. What kind of person spends such ridiculous sums on their face? I’d wonder. But also: How incredible would that be? Pummeled by an affordability crisis that has engulfed everything from housing to health care, young adults have only dialed up the digital window-shopping. A recent survey found that Gen Z now devotes over three hours a day, more than any other generation, to browsing fantasy purchases online. Think: historic homes that cost 200 times your annual rent, bucket-list vacations at 5-star resorts, Jil Sander boots. And now...ground beef? A pound of the stuff costs 43 percent more than it did four years ago. In fact, U.S. food prices have climbed so steeply—25 percent on average between 2019 and 2023—that in August, presidential nominee Kamala Harris announced an economic policy platform that would include the first-ever federal ban on grocery price gouging. Recent research suggests that young women struggle with food insecurity at higher rates than young men, meaning we’re less likely to get the basic nutrition we need for a healthy life. All of which makes what’s happening on TikTok feel even more dystopian. Brooke Baevsky, a 29-year-old private chef in Los Angeles catering to celebrities like Paris Hilton and Adam Sandler, has built a 732,000-strong social following with a stream of stridently aspirational supermarket content. She often records herself shopping for goods at the high-end grocer Erewhon, which has 10 locations across Los Angeles. In a video from March, Baevsky fills two carts, then holds a long scroll of a receipt in front of the camera. The total is over $2,900. A viral upload from last spring with more than 638,000 Likes shows Baevsky sourcing ingredients for a pizza appetizer a client requested. Into her cart go organic figs, adaptogenic mushroom powders, gluten-free flour, $35 balsamic vinegar, a $42 flask of olive oil, and two $26 bottles of purified water, all on top of the extra-extra-special ingredients Baevsky purchased elsewhere: $200 caviar, New Zealand manuka honey, edible 24-karat gold flakes. “Did I feel poor after watching this? Yes,” one commenter writes. “Did I enjoy watching it? Also yes.” Baevsky acknowledges her content acts like an irresistible lens into the country’s sharpening class disparities. “People will go to these stores as tourists just to see them, like a museum, and they’re like, Who buys this stuff? What is it used for? So I kind of answer that question,” she tells me. And she’s blunt about what makes a successful haul video: “showing the outlandish foods that most people in the country do not have.” On other TikTok accounts, creators make sticker shock into a game. A May video with 10,600 comments stars user Vanessa Nagel and a companion at an Erewhon location trying to estimate the price of a large container of prepared mixed berries. One guesses $19; the other guesses $24. Real price: $41.18. It’s a little rage-bait-y (“This is the Hunger Games,” one commenter declares), yet viewers can’t look away. During an anthropological visit to an Erewhon this summer, I myself witnessed multiple groups of young women filming their bewilderment over prices...and gawking at the “real” customers. “Are you from Pretty Little Liars?” a teen girl yelled at a handsome man perusing Wagyu beef with his Australian shepherd. In stark contrast to all this, Baevsky stresses to me that she teaches after-school cooking classes for families facing food insecurity, work that’s close to her heart. She grew up in a western Massachusetts county where nearly half of all households currently lack reliable access to nutritious food. On her social channels, she makes a point to integrate cooking tips for followers on any budget. But nothing does numbers quite like the fantasy excursions. A couple of summers ago, I spent my school hiatus in Los Angeles pretending to be someone with money. That wasn’t my intention—I was supposed to be living frugally while researching a novel—but soon after I arrived, I began living as a woman who takes hot yoga classes and scours flea markets for vintage denim. The bougie neighborhood supermarket was a constant lure, with its imported cheeses, cold-pressed juices, and fresh-cut flowers. I wanted so badly to be the kind of person who could buy these things that I found myself taking out my credit card again and again. TikTok has no shortage of grocery girlies engaged in similar games of economic make-believe, but today’s cohort comes with a twist of wry transparency and a (grim? refreshing?) recognition that sustaining this lifestyle would actually be impossible. One post filmed outside a Whole Foods shows creator Alina Ayoub pushing a cart of brown paper bags. White text across the screen reads, “Cosplaying a rich housewife who only eats organic and doesn’t care about the financial repercussions of an $8 cucumber.” “Cosplaying L.A. influencer is my new favorite hobby,” a user named Kayla Ronquillo captioned a March clip. The video shows her posted up in an outdoor seating area at Erewhon with some of the store’s buzziest items: buffalo cauliflower, gluten-free mac and cheese, the spicy tuna sushi sandwich (“of course”), and a Winnie Harlow x Steens Honey x Erewhon Island Glow Smoothie made with organic blue spirulina powder, red dragon fruit, and vanilla collagen peptides. “Don’t ask me how much I spent,” she says to the camera. To do so would disturb this open-source identity experiment. Some videos incorporate actual aspects of dress-up. At another Whole Foods, registered dietitian Taylor Grasso is seen costumed in a jean jacket and baseball cap, tousled waves spilling out as she saunters down an aisle. Her mission: “pretend you’re a hot, rich suburban mom who buys all her groceries from here.” A July TikTok from beauty influencer Anna Annora offers an aesthetic manual for this kind of consumer, what she calls “the Trader Joe’s girl phenomenon,” where women somehow appear glowy, gorgeous, and spiritually unbothered as they browse for yogurt and toilet paper. All it takes are 12 simple steps: a faint wash of stain dabbed on lips and cheekbones, a bit of spot concealer, strategic shimmery contour, filled-in brows, a smoky smudge of eyeliner, nose stippled with a ColourPop Freckle Pen in Soft Brown, setting powder, a second application of blush, a quick lash curl, mascara, buffed-out lip liner, and a swipe of gloss. Go even deeper into the valley of GroceryTok and you’ll find more echoes of OG beauty and style content. A July haul from creator Kiki Somers features a package of free-range organic chicken breasts presented for the camera like an eyeshadow palette. Other users hold up meatballs, milk, and ice pops in similar fashion. A January clip from user Danielle Demi captures an ironic “unboxing” in which she fawns over a few items from Whole Foods, like a $9 glass vessel of sesame-ginger salad dressing. Drumming her manicured hand on a metallic package of butter, she adds, “Oooh, gold.” Intentionally or not, these creators are performing a sort of reverse engineering, in which everyday fare attains divine status. Something must explain these ungodly prices, the videos seem to imply. Sometimes, like with that butter, it happens in passing. Other times, there’s an entire content universe devoted to a specific luxe item, like Oishii-brand Omakase strawberries, native to the Japanese Alps and known for their creamy sweetness. The Oishii company claims to have designed the optimal year-round growing climate at “the world’s largest indoor vertical strawberry farm”—in New Jersey—and delegates harvesting duties to state-of-the-art robots. For $11.99 to $19.99, you get a sleek container of 11 berries, each nestled in its own protective divot. “Worth it just for the packaging alone,” Meg Radice of @TheVIPList says in a TikTok review. In an April TikTok with 1.1 million Likes, creator Lizzie Dushaj conducts a taste test of Penny Pound Ice–brand cocktail ice from Erewhon. The bag contains eight 2.4-inch spheres of frozen water and costs $30. “Oh my god—this looks like a crystal ball,” she says, holding up a melting orb. “I can’t afford bread,” someone writes in the comments. Lifestyle creator Kayla Brown is done with freewheeling supermarket splurges, even though she once was somewhat known for them. Several years ago, the 29-year-old began sharing grocery hauls on TikTok and admits she used to shop with a money-is-no-object mentality. “I was just like, Oh, this color matches the fridge; this would be great in the TikTok where I do the restock,” she tells me. Then her followers started to push back. “The comments would be like, ‘Well, this is not realistic’; ‘It’s so expensive’; ‘How much did you spend on this?’” The discourse helped Brown rethink her habits—and content strategy. Lately, in an effort to be more relatable (and cut down on food waste), she’s been shopping with a list, and her posts offer a different kind of thrill: sensory delights minus existential stress. In a June video, you hear the pleasing clack of soft-drink cans being placed into a cart, the rattle of shelled pistachios, the soft thump of chicken cutlets hitting the heap, and the rustle of matching cream-colored shopping bags sliding perfectly into a car trunk, all with a soft overdub of Sabrina Carpenter’s “Please Please Please.” Here, the supermarket is not a seat of modern financial anxiety. Instead, viewers feel like they’re in a gentle cocoon, a dreamy realm where their debit card will never be declined. “So satisfying,” someone says in the comments. Brown, who is based in Salt Lake City, has a specific process for stirring such responses. After she puts together a video, she closes her eyes, takes in the audio element, and makes adjustments much like a music producer would. “It’s like a rhythm or a beat,” she says. “Is this clip too quiet? Was there a squeaky noise that wasn’t satisfying?” She also has certain visual trademarks, like showing a bright-red Target shopping cart at the outset, a cue that gets casual users to stop and watch, she theorizes. And she mostly keeps her face out of frame. “You scroll upon this video and it’s kind of a relief, like you’re not trying to connect with another human,” Brown explains. “You’re resetting your mindset. It’s a dopamine release.” Others are leveraging a similar approach, a tranquilizing take on grocery procurement that you don’t need a lot of money to experience IRL...or do you? I enjoy a similar flood of calm while watching an April grocery video from YouTuber Paige Turner, where I’m treated to a whispery voyage through a near-deserted Whole Foods. Turner taps her long silver fingernails against jars of organic fruit spread and packages of ancient grain crackers. She runs her fingers over inscribed bars of natural soap. The sense of tactile access, of actually holding items in hand, is very much part of the fantasy—at least for viewers like me. At the chain supermarket where I shop in Las Vegas, entire aisles of items are locked up behind anti-theft panels, which seems to be a growing norm in lower-income communities. No longer can you freely pick things up, read the labels, and decide if you want them. You have to ask permission, over and over again, from the employee with the key. After a supermarket haul comes the great kitchen restock. This is the genus of TikTok grocery content that delivers the intense payoff of watching an empty fridge suddenly fill with food. It represents a potent promise fulfilled: In this house, no one goes to bed hungry. For me, the queen of kitchen restocks is Summer Reign Henning, an Atlanta-based content creator and entrepreneur with 2 million TikTok followers. While home organizing is her broader specialty, kitchen restocks are her highest-performing fodder. Her most viral to date, a 2023 video with more than 40 million views, opens with her husband, Ryan, steam cleaning the family’s empty fridge in preparation for a $1,000 influx. From there, Henning removes each item from its original packaging and transfers it to one of many clear containers. There are carafes for milk and juice, a multi-tier egg tray, crisper bins for greens, pull-out bins for snacks, and a special hourglass-style pickle jar that allows you to separate spears from their brine. Some of Henning’s followers gravitate to the Pinterest-y appeal of her system—the creation of order in a chaotic world. And then there are viewers like me, who dream of opening their fridges to find tasty things in seemingly infinite supply. “It looks like a storefront,” Henning says. “Everything is easily accessible. The drink dispenser—when you take one can out, another comes behind it.” Pure magic. “I want my future like this low-key,” one viewer writes. “Literally the level of adulthood I’m trying to get to,” comments another. A number of fans beg Henning to just adopt them. After speaking with her, I reflect on the summer I’d had before I started the Instacart job. I was back in Los Angeles to revise that novel. I got a cat-sitting gig in a wealthy area near Griffith Park and arranged to stay in the stylish apartment of the owner—a retired set decorator—for free. She’d left a few items in her fridge for me: sliced turkey, Swiss cheese, sourdough. Should be enough for a sandwich, read a yellow Post-it note. It was a far cry from Henning’s epic restocks, but it was enough to make me feel cared for. That too was magic. So what if I was an interloper in that nice neighborhood? Maybe I wasn’t cosplaying anymore. My university operates a food pantry for students, staff, and faculty. I applaud its existence and yet have always stopped short of going in. Too embarrassed to admit I might need this kind of support, I’ve driven past, not slowing down, not wanting the shame of seeing my own car in the parking lot. Now I wonder if the real aspirational move might be pulling up. On a whim, I search “food pantry haul” on TikTok. I click on a July video from a creator named Alyshia Abbascia titled “Food Pantry Haul as a Single Mom.” The clip shows Abbascia arriving home with bags of groceries from a North Carolina food pantry. As she places them on the floor, she says, “This is something that I never thought I’d be sharing on the internet. It’s something I don’t even share with the people that I know.” Viewers, myself included, are glad she did. There are more than 1,800 comments. “I would love to be part of your village and place a grocery pickup order for you if you’d let me.” “I am so proud of you. You are doing the best that you can and you should be celebrated.” “No shame, Queen. You are not alone. It’s hard as hell out here, but we are all holding on!” I watch a few other food pantry hauls. Creators marvel over boxes of potatoes, spaghetti, lentils, and nuts, emphasizing how happy they are to have overcome the self-consciousness of seeking help. The videos contain zero fantasy: no talk of product aesthetics, no ASMR, no influencer vibes. Here, at the end of the scroll, I may have finally found my place, where all strawberries—any strawberries—taste amazing.

Title: BlackRock Expanding Tokenized Fund BUIDL to Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism’s OP Mainnet, and Polygon

BlackRock announced on Wednesday that it is expanding its tokenized liquidity fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), to operate on multiple blockchain platforms. According to the press release, the fund, originally launched on Ethereum in March 2024 and tokenized through Securitize, will now extend to new share classes on Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism’s OP Mainnet, and Polygon. This strategic expansion, as BlackRock and Securitize claim, is part of an ongoing push to enhance tokenization in the financial sector. By integrating with these blockchain networks, BUIDL reportedly aims to offer improved interoperability, enabling applications and users to interact with the fund more efficiently. The fund is expected to provide users with on-chain yield opportunities, real-time peer-to-peer transfers, flexible custody options, and the ability to accrue and distribute dividends on-chain. The firms involved highlight that BUIDL has already reached a significant milestone, becoming the largest tokenized fund by assets under management (AUM) within 40 days of its initial launch. BlackRock asserts that expanding the fund’s presence across multiple blockchains will offer increased flexibility and access for various market participants, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and firms native to the digital asset sector. The goal, according to the release, is to allow developers to leverage the fund within their preferred blockchain environments. Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, stated that this move aligns with the company’s vision of building a robust, blockchain-native financial ecosystem. He noted that real-world asset tokenization is scaling up and that the addition of new blockchains could potentially enhance the capabilities of the BUIDL ecosystem. Domingo believes this expansion could drive further interest from investors looking to utilize blockchain technology for increased efficiency. BNY Mellon is mentioned as playing a role in facilitating this cross-chain integration. Acting as the fund administrator and custodian, BNY reportedly helped BUIDL go live on these additional blockchain platforms. Each blockchain network will host a distinct share class of the BUIDL fund with specific management fees. For instance: The new blockchains are intended to enhance the interoperability of BUIDL, potentially opening up new avenues for integration with various decentralized applications. Investors are cautioned that the fund carries various risks associated with blockchain investments, including regulatory uncertainty and market volatility. BlackRock emphasizes that BUIDL is designed for qualified investors with a high tolerance for risk, given that it operates under exemptions from U.S. securities registration requirements. The minimum investment threshold for BUIDL is set at $5 million, targeting institutional clients rather than retail investors.

Crypto ETF issuer and asset manager BlackRock announced on Wednesday the expansion of its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to include five new blockchain ecosystems: Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon. Initially launched on the Ethereum network in March 2024, BUIDL rapidly gained traction among investors, becoming the largest tokenized fund globally regarding assets under management (AUM) within just 40 days. The expansion will allow BUIDL to interact with more blockchain-based financial products and infrastructures. BlackRock aims to enhance accessibility for investors, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and digital asset firms, enabling them to leverage BUIDL within the ecosystems of their choice. Carlos Domingo, CEO and co-founder of Securitize, the firm responsible for tokenizing BUIDL, emphasized the importance of this multi-chain approach in Wednesday’s press release by saying: Real-world asset tokenization is scaling, and we’re excited to have these blockchains added to increase the potential of the BUIDL ecosystem. With these new chains we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do. With the addition of these blockchains, BlackRock aims to provide increased options and access for investors, allowing developers to build applications that integrate seamlessly with the BUIDL fund. BNY Mellon, which recently received a Bitcoin and crypto custody license for institutional services, will play a key role in this initiative as the fund administrator and custodian for BUIDL. On the crypto ETF front, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has reached a remarkable milestone, surpassing the $40 billion mark in assets under management (AUM) just two weeks after hitting $30 billion. This achievement comes in a record 211 days, shattering the previous record of 1,253 days held by the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG). IBIT is now positioned in the top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at just 10 months old, it has outperformed all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past decade, according to ETF expert Eric Balchunas. Balchunas further highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs collectively have crossed the $90 billion asset threshold, following a significant $6 billion surge in the past few days. This increase comprises $1 billion in new inflows and $5 billion in market appreciation. The growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs indicates that they are now 72% of the way toward surpassing gold ETFs in total assets. The rise in Bitcoin ETF assets has coincided with a surge in investor confidence, particularly following Donald Trump’s recent victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential elections. This political shift has positively influenced market sentiment, contributing to a broader uptick in cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin, in particular, has experienced a substantial rally, climbing over 24% to reach a record high of $93,000 in the past week alone.

Title: Where Will the COP29 Money Come From?
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/where-will-the-cop29-money-come-from-11731551991475.html
Time Published: 2024-11-14T02:39:51Z

(Bloomberg) -- COP29 Daily Reports: Sign up for the Green Daily newsletter for comprehensive coverage of the climate summit right in your inbox. The COP29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, has been dubbed the “finance COP” because its primary objective is to come up with a new and ambitious agreement for climate-related transfers from rich countries to poor countries. But that moniker could have been given to almost any of the other recent United Nations gatherings of world leaders: the COP26 confab in Glasgow in 2021 focused on enlisting institutional investors in the fight against global warming; the crowning achievement of the gathering in Sharm El-Sheikh the following year was a fund to help developing nations face the devastation of climate change; and at last year’s COP28 event, the United Arab Emirates announced a $30 billion venture to fund emissions reductions projects in partnership with BlackRock Inc., TPG Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. Whether it’s Azerbaijan’s manat, or dirhams, pounds or dollars, every climate conversation circles back to how much it will cost — and who’s going to pay. In Baku, that means fighting over a so-called collective and quantified goal for climate finance. That’s the new post-2025 ambition that’s supposed to replace a target set in 2009 for developed countries to provide $100 billion annually by 2020. The earlier goal has proven controversial since it wasn’t met until 2022, and represents just a fraction of the money needed. Even if the new target were to be set at as much as $1 trillion a year, as some of the most climate-vulnerable states have proposed, that would barely scratch the surface. New research published this week by law firm A&O Shearman details an annual $6 trillion investment gap through 2030 to decarbonize the global economy at a pace required by the Paris climate agreement, to say nothing of the cost of adapting to a warmer, more volatile world. Moving from the billions to the trillions will only be possible by involving the private sector. Yet while COP28 in Dubai drew many of Wall Street’s top leaders, from hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio to BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink, COP29 is set to be a much more low-key affair. This year, banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc have sent delegations to Azerbaijan, though these typically include members of their sustainability teams as opposed to senior executives. And that might be the appropriate choice given the more technical nature of this year’s discussion, said Adair Turner, who previously ran Britain’s financial regulator and is now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission. Financiers in attendance “will be those who want to interface with people actually building the new energy system, rather than people making grand statements,” he said. The biggest opportunities for Baku may not be “on these grand political statements,” Turner said. “We’re not going to get a tightening of the ‘transitioning beyond fossil fuels’ statement, but what we could get is some very concrete things about technologies,” such as commitments to scale up battery storage and grid interconnections, he said. Daniel Hanna, group head of sustainable and transition finance at Barclays, who has traveled to Baku, said he was “looking forward to talking about the progress that’s been made on climate finance, while recognizing that we need to collaborate to move faster and smarter on scaling the next wave of climate technologies, investing in adaptation and finding new public-private models to scale capital into the Global South.” For Turner, who spoke with Bloomberg Green on the first day of COP29, “the single most important thing” to secure at Baku is “a bigger role for development banks.” And right on cue, on Tuesday, the world’s largest multilateral development banks (MDB) announced a new goal to raise $120 billion in annual climate finance for developing nations by the end of the decade, a significant increase on the $75 billion gathered in 2023. MDBs can use their balance sheets to reduce the risks for private investors from allocating funds to nascent technologies and countries, where high credit risks to corruption typically result in a punitive cost of capital. “Many institutional investors are fiduciaries of retirement assets with a duty to focus on returns, and a lot of climate projects just don’t fit that profile without some risk-sharing or guarantees,” said Cara Williams, global head of ESG, climate and sustainability at Mercer. “We hope to see agreements on more public private partnerships announced at COP29 to de-risk investments and make it easier for private capital to be allocated to sustainable-finance projects.” And with many developed governments “under pressure fiscally,”making a modest contribution toward beefing up the MDBs “ought to be the easy win,” Turner said.“The amount of money that’s required to increase the capital resources of the World Bank are really relatively small compared with other things, so it ought to be the win-win here,” he said. Of course, there are very few easy wins in climate. And that’s especially so with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly downplayed climate change while promoting fossil fuels, returning to the White House. Sustainable finance in brief Speaking of which, one of the main drivers behind the right-wing campaign against environmental, social and governance strategies — other than Big Oil and its lobbyists — has been Trump himself. Now that he’s on the way back to the White House, experts expect him to try and finish off ESG. That would mean blocking Securities and Exchange Commission rules for corporate and fund disclosures, and Labor Department requirements on pension funds, according to Rob Du Boff, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The new administration also is expected to put limits on ESG-related shareholder proposals filed during proxy season, he said. “The bottom line is the Trump administration is anxious to undermine these ESG-related initiatives,” Du Boff said.

Title: Bitcoin Price Could Peak In 200 Days, Before US Recession In Mid-2025, Report Says
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-peak-200-days-us-recession-2025-report/
Time Published: 2024-11-14T02:30:56Z
Full Content:
The current Bitcoin (BTC) rally could extend until mid-2025, with a potential price peak before a US recession. A recent Copper Research report, a recent crypto research firm, posits that the leading cryptocurrency by market cap could extend its bullish momentum until mid-2025. As of November 13, Bitcoin is on day 555 of its current market cycle, and a price peak for the digital asset could arrive within the next 200 days. Notably, this peak may coincide with a potential US recession forecasted for mid-2025. According to the report, Bitcoin’s market cycles average 756 days. The starting point of these cycles is when the annual average growth of Bitcoin’s market capitalization turns positive, while the endpoint is when it hits a price peak. The report marks the beginning of the current market cycle around mid-2023, just before asset manager BlackRock filed for a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF). Should Bitcoin stay true to its historical price patterns, the digital asset can hit its price peak for this cycle sometime around mid-2025. The report cites estimates by JPMorgan about the likelihood of a US recession in mid-2025. As a result, BTC’s price peak might align with a potential US economic downturn. Based on data from Treasury spreads, JPMorgan gives a 45% chance of a potential US recession by mid-2025. The report further highlights the gap between BTC’s price top and realized volatility. For the uninitiated, realized volatility measures BTC’s price fluctuations over a specific period, showing the standard deviation of the asset’s returns from the market’s mean return. BTC’s realized volatility currently stands at around 50%, indicating that its volatility is only halfway to previous bull market peaks. Another bullish technical indicator for the BTC price trajectory is its filtered relative strength index (RSI). The report reads: Currently, the RSI sits at 60 – well below previous bull market highs – indicating considerable room for Bitcoin to continue building momentum into the new year. The digital assets market has been on a strong upward trend since pro-crypto Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. Notably, the emerging industry has witnessed its total market cap surge beyond $3 trillion for the first time since November 2021. The rise in total crypto market cap – largely driven by BTC – is not surprising since the Trump administration is speculated to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve akin to that of El Salvador under Nayib Bukele. Bitcoin’s unprecedented price action has propelled the digital asset’s total market cap beyond that of silver, solidifying it as the 8th largest global asset by market cap in existence. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see how BTC dominance (BTC.D) behaves in the coming weeks, especially after facing rejection just below the $90,000 level. Currently hovering slightly above 60%, a fall in BTC.D could signal a capital rotation from BTC into altcoins, potentially benefiting smaller-cap digital assets. BTC trades at $87,767 at press time, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The asset’s total market cap sits at $1.738 trillion.

Title: Every Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct Announcement
URL: https://www.siliconera.com/every-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-announcement/
Time Published: 2024-11-14T00:15:00Z
Full Content:
Published: Nov 13, 2024 07:15 pm The Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct was full of incredible surprises from across every Warcraft title, including some we haven’t seen in generations. From player housing (yes!) to a Classic refresh and The War Within 11.1, here’s every announcement from the livestream. The Warcraft 30th Direct kicked off where it all began: the RTS series. Starting today, Warcraft III: Reforged will update to version 2.0, boasting customizable updated visuals, quality-of-life changes (like hotkey customization), a revamped ladder, and “much, much more.” That’s not all when it comes to Warcraft, though! Warcraft I and II are both receiving Remasters with hand-drawn graphics and much-needed QoL improvements, including health bars, tooltips, a fancy new mission select screen, faster speed, band-box select, and increased unit selection. Phew. Warcraft I Remastered and Warcraft II Remastered launch today (November 13th) alongside the new Warcraft Battle Chest, which includes both remasters and Warcraft III: Reforged — as well as the beautiful Meat Wagon mount in World of Warcraft. The first major patch for WoW: The War Within is Undermined, kicking off Season 2 with lots of goblin goodies, including: From 30th Anniversary Direct’s footage, Undermined looks absolutely phenomenal. The art team didn’t miss here, with Liberation of Undermine potentially shaping up to be one of the best-looking raids of all time. The previously-announced Siren Isle will be hit live servers next month, with epilogues and story content leading us toward Undermined and beyond. According to the 2025 Roadmap, Plunderstorm will return between 11.0.7 and 11.1 with its promised new rewards. That’s right, they’ve finally done it. Player housing is coming to World of Warcraft… In the next expansion. World of Warcraft Midnight will introduce player housing after two decades of fan requests, though we don’t know to what extent just yet. Blizzard will announce more about player housing and Midnight in late summer 2025. Speaking of upcoming content, the 2025 World of Warcraft roadmap details a basic content outline up to the beginning of winter: World of Warcraft: The War Within Heartlands, a 5-part audio novella available right now. Heartlands is written by Adam Christopher and narrated by the legendary Chris Metzen, exploring what happened to Jaina and Thrall while we were busy adventuring in Khaz Algar. Any World of Warcraft Classic player knows the fanbase has been begging for a Classic Era refresh, and I’m happy to say that it’s finally happening. The Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct announced fresh starts for World of Warcraft Classic begin on November 21 with WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition. World of Warcraft Classic 20th Anniversary features “very large” realms with PvE, PvP, and even Hardcore options. Additionally, QoL features like the Chronoboon Displacer and PvP Honor System will be available from the start. Like before, the experience will be split into phases over the course of around a year, before transitioning to… The Burning Crusade Classic returns in late 2025! WoW Classic 20th Anniversary characters will progress into TBC Classic after the conclusion of Phase 6, with the exception of Hardcore characters. It seems like Hardcore TBC isn’t quite on the table just yet. World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic will wrap up with The Hour of Twilight patch in December. The not-so-surprising announce Once Dragon Soul has been swept up, Mists of Pandaria Classic will replace Cataclysm in Autumn 2025. The pre-patch, which brings Pandaren, Monks, Pet Battles, and Theramore’s Fall will fly in Summer 2025. Last, but certainly not least in the 30th Anniversary Direct WoW Classic announcements, is Season of Discovery Phase 7. Late Winter 2024 will see the arrival of Naxxramas and brand-new endgame content starring the Scarlet Crusade and Deadwind Pass. 👀 pic.twitter.com/RzjIa1oe4t Additionally, new Qiraji battle tank mounts were briefly teased in the live stream, presumably for new Ahn’Qiraj content in Phase Six. Coming out of nowhere like a sudden swarm of Zerg was the reveal of Heroes of Starcraft, a mini-set for Hearthstone based on the iconic Blizzard series landing in January 2025. The Zerg, Terran, and Protoss are each represented as factions with their own hero card: Along with cards full of Starcraft characters and references (plus a certain Murloc), Heroes of Starcraft features new music and visuals in Hearthstone’s most extensive mini-set to date. Being almost entirely unchanged in the decade since its launch (ouch, my back), Arena is set to receive some significant updates early next year. Players can choose between two versions of Arena: standard Arena with shortened runs and Underground Arena, featuring longer runs and a new “Redraft on Loss” feature. Redraft on Loss allows you to redraw cards and tweak your deck after a loss in Underground Arena. Both Arena modes will feature separate Arena ratings, with regular Arena matching players with similar skill levels, while Underground features a wild mix of player abilities. The 30th Anniversary direct showcased the roadmap for Year of the Raptor in Hearthstone, featuring three new expansions: Into the Emerald Dream, The Shrouded City, and The Heroes of Time. Into the Emerald Dream features the Druids of the Emerald Dream in a face-off with The Old Gods, heating up mid-season with a Druids of the Flame mini-set. The Shrouded City is Hearthstone’s first sequel set, sending players back to Un’goro to explore and party in the Festival of the Dinosaur mini-set. Finally, The Heroes of Time is a time-travel set featuring alternate realities and an epic final battle with Murozond in the End Time mini-set. What happens at the end of the expansion is something “[we] won’t believe.” The heavens have heard my call, and the once-mobile exclusive Warcraft Rumble is launching on PC with a beta on December 10, 2024. Alongside the beta are three new “Split Leaders”, who belong to multiple families: In addition to these exciting new heroes, Sylvanas will also become a split leader, joining the Horde alongside the Undead. That wraps it up for every announcement from Warcraft’s 30th Anniversary Direct livestream! What are you most excited for? World of Warcraft and Warcraft Battle Chest are available now on PC. Hearthstone is available on PC and mobile devices. Warcraft Rumble is exclusive to mobile devices until it arrives on PC later this year.

Title: The 12 Executives Behind Nvidia’s Unprecedented A.I. Domination
URL: https://observer.com/2024/11/executives-behind-nvidia-ai-domination/
Time Published: 2024-11-13T23:06:27Z
Full Content:
Above a table in a San Jose, Calif., Denny’s hangs a plaque that reads: “The booth that launched a $1 trillion company.” The breakfast spot is where, in 1993, engineers Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem founded the technology company Nvidia (NVDA). As evidenced by the chain’s celebratory plaque, Nvidia surpassed the $1 trillion mark last year. Today, the company’s dominance in the A.I. revolution has boosted its market cap to nearly $3.6 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Despite its seemingly rapid rise, Nvidia’s trajectory has been in the making for some time. While the company started off with a vision to reimagine realistic 3D graphics with chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs), it faced several pitfalls along the way—including a graphics format issue in 1996 that forced Huang, the company’s CEO, to lay off more than half of its employees Three years later, Nvidia launched the industry’s first GPU, the GeForce 256, and became a major player in computer graphics and gaming. Despite its success in that industry, Huang decided to pivot toward A.I. more than a decade ago in the hopes that the nascent technology would take off. His bet has paid off handsomely, with Big Tech players like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) now spending billions of dollars on the Nvidia chips used to power their generative A.I. models. Besides a penchant for leather jackets, Huang is known for his unique leadership style—his executive team contains more than 60 people, all of whom report directly to the CEO. “It’s not conventional, but I’m certain that it’s the best practice,” Huang told Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, of the structure earlier this year. In addition to Nvidia’s innovation in A.I., data centers and gaming, the company is also a powerhouse in visualization and automotive technologies. Here’s a look at some of the top leaders helping Nvidia ride the A.I. wave to unprecedented heights: Huang has served as the CEO and president of Nvidia since its establishment. He owns around 3 percent of the company and has seen his personal net worth swell to an estimated $128 billion over the years, placing Huang among the ten wealthiest people in the world. Huang, who earned a Bachelor of Science from Oregon State University and a master’s in electrical engineering from Stanford, previously worked at companies like LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices. But his first-ever job was as a dishwasher at Denny’s—the very same restaurant that would later serve as the location for Nvidia’s inception. “I used to clean bathrooms, and now I’m CEO of a company… There are a lot of things in life I believe you can learn,” Huang told Collison when asked why he rarely fires employees. “People know that I’d rather torture them into greatness. ” Huang’s fellow co-founder Malachowsky has held several different positions at Nvidia, where he’s overseen areas like IT, operations and product engineering. The executive, who previously held engineering and technical leadership roles at HP and Sun Microsystems, currently focuses on growing the company’s core technologies as an “Nvidia fellow” and its senior technology executive. Malachowsky is also an expert on integrated circuit design and holds some 35 patents. In addition to his work at Silicon Valley-based Nvidia, he serves as an advisor to the Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of Florida. Kress, another member of Nvidia’s executive staff, was recruited by Huang in 2013. Her tenure at the company has included Nvidia’s entry into the $1 trillion club, and then the $3 trillion club, with Kress helping guide Nvidia’s soaring growth across its data center business. Her leadership “has been instrumental in Nvidia’s success with Wall Street and is key to Jensen’s vision,” Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, told Fortune in June. Before joining Nvidia, Kress was chief financial officer for Cisco’s business technology and operations finance division and spent more than a dozen years at Microsoft, where her roles included chief financial officer of its server and tools sector. As head of worldwide field operations, Puri oversees all things related to Nvidia’s global business. The executive’s responsibilities include areas like sales, partnerships, program management and organizing support services. Before joining Nvidia in 2005, Puri spent more than two decades in sales, marketing and management at Sun Microsystems, where his positions included a stint as senior vice president of its Asia-Pacific Group. Before that, Puri worked in roles at Hewlett-Packard, Booz Allen and Texas Instruments. After more than 20 years spent managing operations at companies like Quantum and Coherent, Shoquist joined Nvidia in 2007. As head of operations, she oversees Nvidia’s supply chain functions, logistics and quality management system. Shoquist’s role involves working closely with the company’s global suppliers, which notably includes the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). In what constitutes one of the most lucrative partnerships in A.I., Nvidia counts on TSCMC to manufacture chips such as those belonging to its next-generation Blackwell platform. As one of Nvidia’s longest-serving employees, Diercks has been with the technology company since he became its 22nd employee in 1994. Initially joining as a senior software engineer, he has acted as senior vice president of software engineering since 2008 and leads a team that builds the software underpinning its A.I. accelerators, autonomous vehicle technology and gaming products. Diercks, who previously worked as a software engineer at Pellucid, Inc. and Compaq Computer Group, has also demonstrated an interest in A.I. applications outside of work. Earlier this year, he donated $20 million to fund programs at the Mayo Clinic that will use the new technology for early detection and cancer treatment. Like Diercks, Fisher joined Nvidia three decades ago. During the company’s early days, its initial office was so small that Nvidia employees shared an office bathroom with another company and ate their meals around a ping pong table, he recalled in 2017. Starting as the company’s first salesman, Fisher worked his way up to become the head of its GeForce business unit, which produces the company’s line of GPUs for gaming and 3D rendering. Before joining Nvidia, he previously worked in sales at Adaptec and the Weitek Corporation. Alben, since 2008, has headed GPU engineering at Nvidia, where his team focuses on enhancing the capabilities of next-gen chips. Before joining the company in 1997, he briefly worked at Silicon Graphics. “We had a vision that when we put GPUs out in the world… that somewhere somebody out there in the world would find these GPUs and would use them for some new problem that we didn’t even know about,” said Alben during a 2020 podcast interview. Ian Buck oversees Nvidia’s vast data center business. Buck has been with Huang’s company for 20 years and started as a systems engineer and director. In charge of hardware and software for data centers and A.I. applications, Buck has testified on A.I. before the U.S. Congress and urged federal agencies to invest in and adopt the new technology to bolster the economy. While completing a Ph.D. at Stanford in the early 2000s, Buck helped develop the programming language Brook. At Nvidia, his team helped build CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model introduced in 2006 that built off Buck’s Stanford research and helps developers speed up applications through GPUs. Before embarking on a 22-year career at Nvidia, Lebaredian specialized in visual effects rendering at Warner Brothers Digital and Disney Dream Quest Images and even launched his own company, Steamboat Software, in 1999. Lebaredian joined Nvidia in 2002, where he now heads the company’s Omniverse system and simulation technology. Bringing together generative A.I. with renderings and physics simulations, Nvidia’s Omniverse allows for the creation of so-called “digital twins,” which virtually replicate environments and processes to help companies solve issues across areas like factory scale, robotics development or even climate research. Shapiro has been with Nvidia since 2009 and currently heads its automotive division. In addition to working on in-vehicle improvements and automobile design, Shapiro’s team is focused on enabling A.I. self-driving through the company’s Nvidia Drive platforms. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Shapiro drives an electric vehicle powered by his California home’s solar system. Before joining Nvidia, the executive held marketing, engineering and business development positions at Advanced Micro Devices, Silicon Graphics and Digital Equipment. Siddeek and Nvidia go way back. In the 1990s, he helped the company go public while working at Morgan Stanley (MS) and subsequently joined Nvidia as an investor relations manager in the 2000s before breaking away to work at SoftBank (SFTBF)’s Vision Fund. The executive returned to Nvidia three years ago to head up NVentures, its venture capital arm. As opposed to the larger investments made through Nvidia’s corporate development division, NVentures specializes in earlier-stage startups using A.I. to advance healthcare and manufacturing. The main criterion for investments is “relevancy,” Siddeek told the Financial Times in 2023, describing “companies that use our technology, who depend on our technology, who build their businesses on our technology” as prime targets.

Title: 15 Best-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In this article, we are going to discuss the 15 best-selling Irish whiskey brands in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis of the global whiskey market, the Irish whiskey renaissance, and sustainability in the Irish whiskey industry, and go directly to the 5 Best-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World. One of the oldest distilled spirits in the world, Irish whiskey is most often produced from a combination of malted and unmalted barley and is widely appreciated for its exceptionally smooth flavor and hints of vanilla. The use of unmalted grain began as a way to reduce the tax imposed on malted barley in the middle of the 19th century and is a key factor that distinguishes Irish whiskey from Scotch. Also, while most other whiskeys are twice distilled, Irish whiskeys are usually distilled three times in a column or pot still before they are matured in wooden casks for a minimum of three years. These intricate production steps combine to give the spirit its mellow and approachable character and turn it into a true gem of the Emerald Isle. READ ALSO: 25 Best-Selling Whiskey Brands in the US and 30 Best-Selling Scotch Whisky Brands in the World. Whiskey is one of the Most Consumed Alcohols in the World, with the global whiskey market valued at $64 billion in 2022 and expected to reach $91.3 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 6% during the forecast period. The consumption of alcohol is shifting away from beer and wine and millennials are more likely to experiment with other alcoholic beverages, resulting in the growth of a ‘cocktail culture’. As a result of this tendency, the use of whiskey as a premium ingredient has increased. Product innovations such as flavored whiskeys and organic and sustainable options are also some of the major factors propelling the market. Ireland, once the grand capital of whiskey, is now once again making a grand comeback. The Emerald Isle has gone from once having just two operating distilleries – Bushmills and Midleton – to around 45 currently in operation, and several more in the pipeline. The value of Ireland’s whiskey exports crossed the €1 billion ($1.1 billion) mark for the first time in 2022, with global sales of Irish whiskey growing by 10.3% that year to around 15.25 million cases. The United States continues to be the top market for the category, representing 57% of the total export value. The Irish distillers have been especially focused on premiumization and the strategy seems to be paying off, as more and more consumers across the pond are turning to the smooth spirit as their luxury dram of choice. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, high-end premium and super-premium Irish whiskey categories have grown by an eye-watering 1,053% and 2,769%, respectively, in the last 20 years. Today’s consumers are increasingly aware of the climate emergency and actively seek out sustainable brands, even if it means paying extra. Therefore, as whiskey makers find themselves in an increasingly competitive market, committing psychologically and economically to reducing their impact on the planet may also be the only means to make their businesses sustainable in the long run. In this regard, it was announced last year that Irish Distillers, the Pernod Ricard SA (OTC:PRNDY)-owned producer of some of the world’s most renowned and successful Irish whiskeys, would adopt packaging changes such as removing gift boxes from its Jameson range. The removal will result in four million units being eliminated by the end of 2025 and will also be applied to other brands such as Powers, Spot, and Knappogue Castle. Irish Distillers also revealed in 2022 that it would invest around $55 million to fund projects aimed at transforming Midleton – home of some of the most popular Irish whiskey brands like Jameson, Redbreast, Powers, and Spot – into the first carbon-neutral whiskey distillery in the country by the end of 2026. The project includes shifting the distillery to renewable energy, increasing the efficiency of operations, and recycling the heat that is created as a byproduct of distillation. The aforementioned moves are all part of Pernod Ricard SA (OTC:PRNDY)’s Sustainability and Responsibility 2030 roadmap, which addresses environmental issues, social responsibility, and combatting alcohol abuse. If it stays on this path of sustainability, Irish whiskey can be at the heart of the blueprint to protect Ireland’s unique environment, while also continuing to be a modern, competitive, and successful industry that produces some of the best whiskeys in the world. With a market cap of over $30 billion as of the writing of this article, Pernod Ricard SA (OTC:PRNDY) is included among the Most Valuable Alcohol Companies in the World. While we acknowledge the potential of PRNDY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PRNDY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. With that said, here are the Most Popular Irish Whiskey Brands in the World. Pixabay/Public Domain To collect data for this article, we have referred to The Brand Champions 2024 magazine by The Spirits Business, looking for the Top-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World. We found information for only the top 3 best-selling Irish whiskey brands in the magazine and so we ranked them by the sales volumes of their 9-liter cases in 2023. Due to the absence of reliable sales figures for the remaining brands, we resorted to using popularity as a proxy for sales. Therefore, we picked whiskeys that appeared multiple times on websites like VinePair, Liquor, Men’s Journal, Reddit, etc., assigned them a score of 1 each time they were recommended on these sources, and then summed up the scores and ranked our list accordingly. When two or more brands had the same score, we ranked them by the number of upvotes they received on Reddit. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Insider Monkey Score: 4 Glendalough is often billed as being ‘Ireland's First Craft Distillery’ and is known for creating some innovative world-firsts such as the first Irish single malt whiskey aged in rare Japanese Mizunara oak, or an Irish single malt aged in Wicklow Irish oak, etc. Glendalough also pays special attention to staying sustainable and was named Ireland’s 'Sustainable Distillery of the Year' by the Icons of Whisky Awards in 2021. Insider Monkey Score: 5 Here we have an extremely smooth and creamy single-malt whiskey made by the Cooley Distillery, now owned by the Japanese Suntory Holdings. The Tyrconnell was claimed to be the top-selling Irish whiskey before Prohibition and its success continues to this day, as it is currently one of the fastest-growing Irish single malts in the world. Insider Monkey Score: 5 Also produced by the famous Cooley Distillery in County Louth, Connemara’s complex peat flavors and smooth, sweet malt taste make it a truly unique offering. Connemara is regarded as one of the pioneers of smoky Irish whiskeys and has even been honored as the 'World's Best Irish Single Malt', among other accolades. Insider Monkey Score: 6 Founded by father and son Henry and Alex Conyngham in 2009, Slane uses quality ingredients and an innovative recipe to create an exceptionally complex and smooth whiskey. Slane was acquired by Brown-Forman in 2015, following which the Jack Daniel’s maker made a hefty investment of $50 million to build a new four-acre distilling site to produce the award-winning whiskey. Insider Monkey Score: 6 Owned by the Sazerac Company, Paddy’s is a premium, triple-distilled blend of grain, malt, and pot still whiskeys. Often described as unpretentious and friendly, this popular Irish whiskey is great for mixing and has some very loyal fans, particularly in the south of Ireland. Insider Monkey Score: 6 One of the most famous Irish whiskey brands in recent years is Conor McGregor’s Proper No. Twelve – a smooth blend of triple-distilled malt and grain whiskey aged for four years in bourbon barrels, delivering a delicious taste with hints of vanilla, honey-like sweetness, and toasted wood. A majority stake in the brand was acquired by Proximo Spirits for a reported $600 million in 2021. Insider Monkey Score: 7 A unique marriage of single pot still and single malt Irish whiskey, Walsh Whiskey’s Writers’ Tears is a critically acclaimed, award-winning recreation of the fabled 19th-century dram that was a favorite among the literary giants of the era. Insider Monkey Score: 8 Named after the castle in County Clare, Kannpogue Castle is a range of vintaged Irish whiskeys that was originally founded by American Mark Edwin Andrews in the 1960s. One of the Top 10 Best-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World, Knappogue Castle was acquired by Irish Distillers in 2021. Insider Monkey Score: 13 Dedicated to bringing new and innovative flavors to Irish whiskey, the Teeling Distillery opened its doors in 2015 as the first new distillery in Dublin in over 125 years. In less than a decade since its launch, the brand is already exported to over 80 markets worldwide and has won hundreds of international awards for its quality and depth of flavor. Insider Monkey Score: 14 With a history that spans over two centuries, Powers is the truest expression of Irish whiskey made at the Midleton distillery in County Cork. The brand has been part of Pernod Ricard since 1989. A three-time gold winner at the Irish Whiskey Masters in 2021, 2022, and 2023, the flagship Powers Gold is one of the Best-Selling Whiskeys in Ireland. Insider Monkey Score: 17 Distilled at Midleton for the family-owned Mitchell & Son Wine Merchants, the Spot series offers some of the finest examples of pot still whiskey available today. Produced in limited volumes, they are among the rare single pot still whiskeys still made today in a process that results in an intense, characterful aroma. With its fresh fruit and delicate spices, the iconic Green Spot whiskey was also included in our list of the Best Whiskeys in the World in 2024. Insider Monkey Score: 20 The most awarded single pot still Irish whiskey in the world, Redbreast is the definitive expression of this quintessential style of Irish whiskey making. Keeping up with its innovative spirit, the brand also introduced the Redbreast Tawny Port Cask Edition in September 2023, a limited-edition expression finished in tawny port casks from Portugal's breathtaking Douro Valley. With 56,000 9-liter cases sold in the US last year, Redbreast is one of the Best-Selling Irish Whiskeys in America. 9-Liter Cases Sold in 2023: 1.1 million Established in 1608, Bushmills is the oldest whiskey distillery in the world and is renowned for making exceptional triple-distilled single malt and blended Irish whiskeys. Proximo Spirits, owner of Bushmills, unveiled its new $48 million Causeway Distillery last year which has more than doubled its annual production from 5 million liters to 11 million. 9-Liter Cases Sold in 2023: 1.6 million Tullamore D.E.W. prides itself on its complex yet approachable flavors, which it credits to its use of three types of grain, a triple distillation, and the blending of three types of Irish whiskey – single malt, single grain, and pot still. Its sweet, soft, faint, and easy-to-drink character makes it one of the Best Whiskeys for Beginners in 2024. Set in the heart of Ireland, the Tullamore distillery spans a whopping 58 acres where 11 million liters of whiskey are produced each year, making Tullamore D.E.W. one of the finest examples of Ireland’s whiskey renaissance. 9-Liter Cases Sold in 2023: 10.2 million One of the Most Popular Whiskey Brands in the World, Jameson’s blended whiskeys are produced from malted and unmalted Irish barley before being triple-distilled, resulting in exceptional smoothness. Part of the Pernod Group since 1988, Jameson’s portfolio is led by its core offering of Jameson Original, with its super-premium expression, Jameson Black Barrel, also experiencing dynamic growth and offering a new taste experience. With a staggering 10.2 million 9-liter cases sold last year, Jameson is, by a margin, the #1 Selling Irish Whiskey in the World.

Asset management titan BlackRock is announcing the expansion of its proprietary BUIDL, the company’s on-chain money market fund, across five new blockchains. According to an announcement by real-world asset tokenizing firm Securitize, BlackRock’s brokerage partner, BUIDL will be expanding to layer-1 blockchains Aptos (APT) and Avalanche (AVAX) as well as layer-2 scaling solutions Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (POL). As stated by Securitize chief executive and co-founder Carlos Domingo, “We wanted to develop an ecosystem that was thoughtfully designed to be digital and take advantage of the advantages of tokenization. Real-world asset tokenization is scaling, and we’re excited to have these blockchains added to increase the potential of the BUIDL ecosystem. With these new chains we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do.” BUIDL, which launched in March and stands for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, is a tokenized money-market fund designed to offer a stable value of $1 per token while providing yield on US Treasuries. According to Securitize, the expansion will help developers, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and other crypto firms to build with BlackRock’s product on their blockchain of choice. Last month, it was reported that BlackRock was in talks with numerous crypto exchange platforms – such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit – about using BUIDL as collateral for derivatives contracts.

Title: Protesters Take to MoMA During World Jewish Congress Gala

Join Us One person was taken into police custody last night, November 12, at a protest outside the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) during the World Jewish Congress’s (WJC) 2024 Theodor Herzl Award Dinner taking place at the institution.Some 40 people gathered outside the museum’s 53rd Street entrance yesterday evening in response to a call shared by pro-Palestine advocacy groups, including Writers Against the War on Gaza (WAWOG) and Within Our Lifetime, to protest MoMA Honorary Board Chair Ronald Lauder. The billionaire heir to the Estée Lauder fortune is also the president of the WJC, a federation of Jewish communities and Israel advocates. Founded in 1936 to “support the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine,” among other aims, the organization regularly lobbies on behalf of Israel and has rejected reports presented to the United Nations alleging that Israel’s ongoing attacks on Gaza constitute genocide. Before the protest began at around 5:30pm, police had sectioned off the institution’s main entrance, where the group crowded around a sign that read “MoMA Trustees Fund Genocide Apartheid and Settler Colonialism.” Chanting “Free Palestine” and “No justice, no peace,” they called on MoMA to disaffiliate from “dirty money.” A woman wearing an Israeli flag draped around her shoulders made her way into the group of protesters around 6:30pm and was escorted out of the crowd by police seconds later without the flag. Hyperallergic also witnessed an altercation between a suited man and a protester wearing a keffiyeh; the protester, who declined to provide his name, alleged that the man yanked at the Palestinian headscarf on his neck. A police officer then ushered the suited man inside MoMA. Get the latest art news, reviews and opinions from Hyperallergic. Writer Sarah Nicole Prickett, a WAWOG organizer, was stopped by two police officers as she was crossing the street between two groups of protesters on both sides of the barricaded entrance. She was charged with disorderly conduct, according to a summons note reviewed by Hyperallergic. A New York Police Department spokesperson confirmed that one person was taken into custody and released with a summons to appear in criminal court next month. In an interview with Hyperallergic, Prickett said, “The least we can do is disorder things.” “We want these institutions to know that they can no longer silently, tacitly, and inconsequentially participate in the death-dealing activities of organizations like the World Jewish Congress,” she said. MoMA has not replied to Hyperallergic’s request for comment. The WJC’s Theodor Herzl Award, named after the man credited as the founder of Zionism, was given this year to former United States Ambassador to China and Russia Jon M. Huntsman Jr. as a “devoted friend of Israel and the Jewish people.” Tal Huber, the Israeli graphic designer behind the red, black, and white “Kidnapped” posters wheat-pasted globally in the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7 attack, was also honored at last night’s gala with an award for advancing Jewish culture. During his gala address, recorded in a video posted to the WJC’s YouTube channel and reviewed by Hyperallergic, Lauder mocked what he said was an effort to rename Thanksgiving to “Indigenous People’s Appreciation and Remembrance Day.” In 2019, Donald Trump claimed at a rally that liberals wanted to change the name of the holiday but did not specify to what. “Now Thanksgiving has turned into a day that sees the same pilgrims not as brave souls who risked everything to escape religious persecution in Europe, they are now seen as colonial occupiers,” Lauder said. Later in his remarks, Lauder added, “This is hardly an American phenomenon. The Jewish world has been watching this self-hatred throughout Europe in France and England … That is why the World Jewish Congress is now focusing all our efforts on education and fighting this Marxist indoctrination that has infiltrated our schools.” Bobuq Sayed, a New York City-based writer from the Afghan diaspora who participated in the action, told Hyperallergic that they were protesting because “cultural institutions like the MoMA have a responsibility to cultural workers and not to billionaire benefactors.” Graphic designer Liv Senghor also attended the protest as an organizer of the environmental action group Planet Over Profit. “We thought it was important for us to show up as climate protesters to show solidarity and that we understand that all our struggles are connected,” Senghor said. MoMA has been the target of several protest campaigns targeting trustees’ links to human rights violations, military violence, and environmental damage. In 2021, a 10-week action series known as Strike MoMA called on the museum to drop board members including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and financier Leon Black. In the wake of pressure over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including an open letter from artists published in Hyperallergic, Black stepped down from his role as board chairman but remains a museum trustee. The World Jewish Congress has not yet responded to a request for comment.

Title: What Nvidia wants (but may not get) from the Supreme Court

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) are fighting two Supreme Court cases this year that they claim will flood the legal system with investor lawsuits if not decided in their favor. So far, things aren't exactly going their way. Nvidia’s lawyers made their case before the high court on Wednesday and drew skepticism from justices across the ideological spectrum. The same happened to Meta’s lawyers last week. “It just seems to me that you're asking us to engage in a kind of analysis that we are not very good at,” Justice Elena Kagan, an appointee by Democratic President Barack Obama, told Nvidia’s lawyer Neal Kumar Katyal. The outcome of the cases could undermine or embolden future securities fraud litigants. Nvidia argues that investors who sued the company alleging that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made false statements should be required to present more particular information in their lawsuit about what Huang knew at the time of his statements. The investors claim that in 2017 and 2018, Huang knowingly departed from Nvidia’s internal company data by misattributing the company’s demand for chips to the video gaming market. Demand at the time, the investors hypothesized, was actually driven by the more volatile market of cryptocurrency mining. That hypothesis relied on the opinion of a financial analyst who based his conclusion on publicly available documents, rather than Nvidia’s company documents. “This is a highly technical subject, and I just don't understand how a court is opposed to be evaluating that at the pleading stage,” Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, told Nvidia’s lawyer. The justices pressed Nvidia to explain why they should reverse a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, repeating a point they made in the case against Meta's Facebook argued last week. In both cases, the appellate court allowed investors to proceed against the companies with proposed class-action securities fraud suits. Yale Law School professor Jonathan Macey said he was surprised by the justices’ questions in the Facebook case. “One thing that was amazing in the oral argument,” he said, “is you've got this kind of across-the-aisle alliance” with conservative Justice Clarence Thomas to liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressing concerns that were “very pro-plaintiff.” Facebook, for its part, said investors should not be able to allege that it misled its stockholders by omitting that its partnership with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users. At the core of both disputes are questions about what facts a plaintiff must include in a legal complaint to keep a case in court. Facebook argued that its disclosures were not false or misleading by failing to disclose that the Cambridge Analytica breach actually materialized in the past, especially because the so-called risk posed no known risk of ongoing or future business harm. According to Nvidia, investors should not be able to maintain a proposed class-action lawsuit against the company by relying on an expert’s opinion. “Congress … wanted to stop lawsuits like this, lawsuits that allowed for fraud by hindsight,” Katyal said on behalf of Nvidia during Wednesday’s arguments. “When a stock drops, all [plaintiffs] have to do is find an expert with numbers that contradict a company's public statements,” Katyal said. Katyal went on to say that a decision in favor of the shareholders created “an easy road map” for plaintiffs to evade a federal law that requires particular information to be included in a securities fraud complaint. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), which was in part created to prevent frivolous lawsuits, states that a plaintiff must show that a defendant company intended to make a false or misleading statement and that the statement was, in fact, false. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, also entertained the idea that the PSLRA may need refining. Gorsuch said “it beggars belief” to think that a CEO, such as Huang, would have been unaware of the source of such a large portion of the company's income. Jim Redwood, a securities law professor with Albany Law, doubted that Supreme Court would ultimately rule in favor of the investors, saying he expects both cases to be resolved in a manner that curbs future securities class action lawsuits. “The Facebook case is somewhat closer,” he said, explaining that the social media company’s case may be somewhat weaker than Nvidia’s. The Justice Department joined in the Nvidia case, siding with investors. “We think that the 9th Circuit correctly applied the standard here,” the DOJ’s lawyer said during arguments on Wednesday.

Title: OpenAI is launching an AI agent that can do work for people

OpenAI is on to the next wave of artificial intelligence with an autonomous agent it reportedly plans to launch in January. The AI agent, codenamed “Operator,” can do tasks on behalf of a person, including coding and booking travel, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The startup plans to release the AI agent as a research preview and through its application programming interface (API), OpenAI leaders reportedly told staff in a meeting Wednesday. OpenAI is working on other AI-agent-related projects, including a tool that can perform tasks in a web browser, people told Bloomberg. That tool is reportedly close to completion. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The startup’s investor and partner, Microsoft (MSFT-2.82%), announced in October that its Copilot AI users could build their own autonomous agents in Copilot Studio starting this month. The autonomous agents can “understand the nature of your work and act on your behalf,” Microsoft said. In July, Nvidia (NVDA-4.19%) CEO Jensen Huang and Meta (META-4.22%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed a future where everyone has an AI assistant. “Every single restaurant, every single website will probably, in the future, have these AIs,” Huang said about Meta’s AI Studio platform, which allows users and creators to generate AI characters of themselves that can assist with different tasks. Zuckerberg added, “Just like every business has an email address and a website and a social media account, I think, in the future, every business is going to have an AI.” Meanwhile, OpenAI launched ChatGPT’s ability to search the web in October. ChatGPT search provides links to relevant web sources in its responses, “which you would have previously needed to go to a search engine for,” OpenAI said. With web search on ChatGPT, users can ask questions “in a more natural, conversational way.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

By Blizzard Entertainment 1 day ago It’s a big year for the Warcraft universe, and whether you’re a Hearthstone fan, you’ve joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you’re a World of Warcraft player, there’s something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream. Join us for a celebration as we dip into the mana pool of nostalgia and cast far sight on the future of all things Warcraft. Viewers can watch on any Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Warcraft Rumble stream on Twitch or TikTok to earn rewards during the giveaway period from November 13 at 10:00 am PST through December 11 at 10:00 am PST. Learn more in our previously published article. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know from the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct here. Jump directly to each section to learn more: Warcraft RTS, Hearthstone, Warcraft Rumble, World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft Classic, World of Warcraft: The War Within. It’s been 30 years since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans made its debut, setting the path for so many stories and adventures that have come after. To continue these adventures in the Warcraft series, we’ve released Patch 2.0— now available for all Warcraft III: Reforged players. The patch overhauls environments, lighting, and the user interface. It also introduces uprezzed classic Warcraft III assets to HD, allowing players to choose and customize their graphical experience. Mix and match assets as you wish. There are also new quality-of-life improvements such as in-game hotkey customization, updated ladder, and much much more. Beyond the update for Warcraft III: Reforged, we’re happy to announce the release of fully remastered versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II, taking you beyond Orcs and Humans, the Tides of Darkness, and the Dark Portal for the first time, again. Players will be able to switch between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time. We’ve also added more modern controls to Warcraft I, such as right-click move, band box select, and faster game speed. Both Warcraft I and II also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and health bars, a mission select screen, and increased unit selection. Warcraft II will continue to have multiplayer functionality, and all legacy custom maps will remain fully compatible and playable. Travel back in time to experience each of these titles once more or— for the very first time— by visiting the shop: Warcraft I: Remastered, Warcraft II: Remastered, Warcraft III: Reforged. You’ll never forget the first time you hear “zug zug.” We’ve also brought back the Battle Chest, allowing players to purchase all three games in one bundle. For those who already purchased Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft®: II Battle.net® edition, or Warcraft III: Reforged from the Battle.net shop, the bundle will be available at a discount. Early next year, Hearthstone is going beyond Warcraft and into... Heroes of StarCraft! This special Mini-Set will have a whopping 49 new cards across three themed factions, which show what the StarCraft universe would look like in the Hearthstone Tavern. Each faction is made up of cards that can be used across multiple classes, including an iconic Hero card. Zerg Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Hunter, and Warlock have joined the Zerg! Led by the formidable Sarah Kerrigan, they will have aggressive cards that win the game by swarming the board. Protoss Druid, Mage, Priest, and Rogue fight for the Protoss Empire. Led by the High Templar Artanis, they will have powerful, high-cost cards that are made cheaper throughout the game. Terran Paladin, Shaman, and Warrior make up the Terran forces, lead by the one and only Jim Raynor. They will command Battlecruisers—a special take on the Starship mechanic from The Great Dark Beyond. The Mini-Set will feature a slew of StarCraft units which are sure to invoke nostalgia, as well as the Terran-armored Murloc, Grunty, and new, thematic music. You can chart a course for the Heroes of StarCraft Mini-Set, launching in January 2025! More announcements, details, and card reveals are coming closer to launch. Then, for the first time in 10 years, Arena Mode is getting a major overhaul. With that update, there will be two kinds of Arena to choose from. Normal Arena will be shorter form, allowing you to complete your runs more quickly. Competitive Arena players will be able to play in the higher-stakes Underground Arena, with longer runs and a new feature: Re-Draft on Loss. Re-Draft on Loss means that, after you lose, you’ll have the option to re-draft cards, edit your deck, and keep your run alive. Ratings will also be added to both Normal and Underground Arena. Normal, skill-based matchmaking will be used for Normal Arena. Underground Arena throws caution to the wind and lets you face off against opponents of all skill levels. This major Arena revamp is coming in the first half of next year. Look out for more details about this update closer to when it goes live. On top of those updates, Hearthstone has an exciting year of expansions ahead, with much-requested themes, locations, and familiar faces across Azeroth. In the first expansion of the year, enter the Emerald Dream and join the battle between the Old Gods and the Druids of the Emerald Dream for the fate of the World Tree. Things will heat up even more when the Druids of the Flame light up the Mini-Set (releasing earlier than normal this year, during the 32.2 Patch). The second expansion of the year will be Hearthstone’s first-ever sequel: the return to Un’Goro Crater! Join Elise on a hunt for a mythical, lost Tortollan city. When you find it, join the Tortollans in a festival to celebrate the mighty dinosaurs of the crater in the 33.4 Mini-Set. In the third expansion of the year, travel with Chromie through alternate realities to recruit Legendary Warcraft heroes like you’ve never seen them before. Leading to the 34.4 Mini-Set: an epic showdown against Murozond at the end of time! It’s been one year since Warcraft Rumble went live. To celebrate, players can log in to Warcraft Rumble today and join the one-year anniversary celebration in game. Players can collect daily rewards, including new avatars and cosmetics! The Warcraft universe is built on rich and diverse characters that may not fit into any singular family, and because of this, we’re introducing split Leaders! In Season 10, we reintroduce Sylvanas Windrunner as the first playable split Leader, honoring her allegiance to both the Horde and Undead families. Later, we will introduce Malfurion Stormrage as Alliance and Cenarion, Orgrim Doomhammer as Horde and Blackrock, and last but not least, Anub’arak as Undead and Beast. Warcraft Rumble is coming to PC! The PC beta will launch on December 10, 2024; stay tuned for more information! World of Warcraft celebrates 20 years of adventure in Azeroth, bringing together players of all ages and abilities from all over the world, making connections both in the game and out. Inspired by the incredible story captured in “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin” documentary about Mats “Ibelin” Steen—now live on Netflix— a Norwegian WoW® player who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, you can add the Reven Pack to your collection and support CureDuchenne, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and extending the lives of those affected by this disease. Live now in modern World of Warcraft, players can join the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration to collect updated Tier 2 armor appearance sets, undertake Classic Timewalking, engage with others to defeat iconic world bosses, head to the Trading post, and earn iconic new rewards, and more. The War Within has taken the leap into the first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga and adventures continue in WoW Classic, but this is only the beginning of what we have planned. Currently, in Season of Discovery, players are exploring new adventures with new class abilities, all-new level-up raids, finding secrets, and teaming up to defeat Ragnaros and Nefarian. It won’t be long until everyone can join the War Effort and open the gates to Ahn’Qiraj, where they’ll get to plunder the depths for new rewards and face new challenges. After Ahn’Qiraj, players in Season of Discovery can look forward to one more phase, in which they’ll face the dangers of Naxxramas, along with new instanced content featuring the Scarlet Crusade as well as adventures in Deadwind Pass! In Cataclysm Classic, Ragnaros has risen in the Firelands once more, and players are working toward adding the Dragonwrath Staff to their collection. In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year. And that’s not all we have in store for Classic World of Warcraft. We’re pleased to announce that Mists of Pandaria Classic will be arriving in the summer of 2025, taking players back to the shores of Pandaria and bringing its legendary class design, incredible raids and dungeons, stunning environments, and (of course) an unforgettable soundtrack. Relive the World of Warcraft Classic experience with all-new fresh realms in the WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition arriving November 21. Join players on a whole new journey to level 60, with the first raid dungeon, Molten Core, becoming available a few weeks after launch. Choose to play on a PvP realm, a Normal PvE realm, or (for the very first time) a Hardcore realm progressing through content with the other realms — all from the beginning, with fresh economies, on very large realms. These realms will launch with some of the quality-of-life features that came later in the WoW Classic cycle, such as the Chronoboon Displacer to save your world buffs and the improved PvP Honor Ranking system. The PvP and Normal PvE realms will also progress into Burning Crusade Classic! It's never too late to go back and re-experience World of Warcraft anew—just in time to celebrate 20 years of adventures in Azeroth! The first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga kicked off in August with the launch of The War Within, bringing with it myriad new experiences with a new raid, dungeons, delves, PvP, new appearances and rewards, pets, mounts and much more. On the horizon, our next content update, Siren Isle, is currently available on the Public Test Realms (PTR), and the update will go live next month with a little something for everyone. This update also includes the epilogue questline for Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. No spoilers, but the storyline will feature the mysterious haranir, who also starred in the expansion release cinematic. The Siren Isle introduces a new outdoor environment to explore, full of mysteries to uncover and rewards to help catch your alternate characters up and prepare for the next War Within season ahead. Plunderstorm is returning with a new Plunderstore to provide more flexibility for earning rewards instead of a linear Renown track. There are also some quality-of-life changes to spell interactions, the UI and more ahead. The Siren Isle content update also brings with it Turbulent Timeways once more and additional updates to the Feast of Winter Veil in-game holiday event. We’re introducing a new novella that explores more of the story behind the scenes. Find out what happened with Jaina and Thrall after the Fall of Dalaran as they seek out reinforcements in this five-chapter special— available today and as read by Chris Metzen! Listen and read here. Xal’atath’s trail leads adventurers to a location in our next major content update that has long been known about but, as yet, remained unexplored—the Undermine. Players will travel deep into the goblin city of Undermine, the capital of the goblin’s trade empire! It is a city like none other seen before in World of Warcraft and stands as a testament to goblin intelligence and creativity as experts in both technology and alchemy. As our adventures continue, we’ll learn more about goblin culture and society that we have never been able to see before. We’ll learn what’s important to them, the problems they are trying to solve —everything that makes them truly unique, and what they’re capable of as a society. We’ll dig a bit deeper beyond just their humor and explosions, though there will still be explosions and a LOT of mayhem to be found. You’ll arrive in an Undermine that’s in conflict between the four major goblin cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company. Each cartel is run by notorious goblins like Monte Gazlowe, Renzik “The Shiv,” Baron Revilgaz, Marin Noggenfogger, and more. Which one you align yourself with is up to you. You’ll want to make sure you have a sweet ride to roll around town in— players can earn a customizable vehicle early on that’s designed just for use in Undermine. You’ll push the boundaries of locomotion on the roads of Undermine and speed through its causeways and byways at a higher rate than a ground mount can. Players can adjust the car’s driving characteristics by adding a little extra grip to hug the roads or adjust to slide and glide as they drift around corners. Want to accelerate faster? Then, you may have to sacrifice a little speed. How you customize your car’s characteristics is up to you. The new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, builds on the narrative of Undermine as players race to stop a group of goblins from blowing a dam that will bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This new dungeon will be available immediately as a part of the new The War Within Season 2 dungeon pool on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+, alongside the four other launch dungeons and three legacy dungeons. We’ll share more information on the full slate of dungeons at a later point, but we would be remiss if we didn’t include MOTHERLODE from Battle for Azeroth in the rotation. Players will also experience two new Delves and variations of existing Delves in the content update. Seasonal updates are also being introduced to Brann Bronzebeard, a new adversary to follow, Zek’vir, and a new set of goblin-inspired Curios. Experience a new 8-boss raid dungeon that takes you through the city streets and into the magnificent Gallagio— brimming with color and extravagance, it houses the dark secrets of its owner— Gallywix. There’s more at play here than it first seems, and goblin politics are treacherous and fraught with the underpinnings of something more where Xal’atath is concerned. There’s even more ahead in 2025, and we have the roadmaps to help guide you on what you can look forward to in World of Warcraft and WoW Classic. Thank you for making Azeroth your home over these last two decades. Speaking of home, the World of Warcraft team has one last thing to share with you… And yes, in World of Warcraft: Midnight, your next adventure begins at home. A house to call your very own. Stay tuned! Wherever your gaming experience takes you, we can’t wait to continue on this journey with you all. Lok’tar ogar! We’ll see you at the Inn, in Azeroth, and wherever the road takes us all next!

This expansion is part of BlackRock’s strategy to strengthen its tokenization efforts, transforming BUIDL into a multi-chain asset. It enables users and applications within these blockchain ecosystems to access BUIDL more efficiently. The fund, which primarily invests in US Treasuries, cash, and other liquid assets, will offer new users across these blockchain networks features such as on-chain yield, flexible custody, real-time peer-to-peer transfers, and on-chain dividend accrual and distribution. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo emphasized that the expansion aligns with the company’s vision to build a tokenization-based ecosystem. He pointed out that these new blockchains would enhance BUIDL’s potential, especially as the tokenization of real-world assets continues to gain traction. He stated: “With these new chains we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do.” BNY Mellon, the fund’s administrator, is backing this expansion and will continue to act as its custodian across these additional blockchain networks. According to the press statement, BUIDL became the largest tokenized fund by assets under management (AUM) less than 40 days after its launch on the Ethereum blockchain. According to DeFillama data, BUIDL’s market capitalization stood at $518 million at the time of writing. The expansion to other blockchain networks opens up new investment opportunities for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), digital asset firms, and other market participants. Meanwhile, the expansion also brings new management fees for different networks. The fund’s users across Aptos, Avalanche, and Polygon PoS will be charged a fee of 20 basis points, while Arbitrum, Ethereum, and Optimism users will incur a 50-basis-point fee. Additionally, BlackRock will receive quarterly fees from Aptos, Avalanche, and Polygon based on the average value of the relevant share class each quarter. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

By Blizzard Entertainment 1 day ago It’s a big year for the Warcraft universe, and whether you’re a Hearthstone fan, you’ve joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you’re a World of Warcraft player, there’s something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream. Join us for a celebration as we dip into the mana pool of nostalgia and cast far sight on the future of all things Warcraft. Viewers can watch on any Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Warcraft Rumble stream on Twitch or TikTok to earn rewards during the giveaway period from November 13 at 18:00 GMT through December 11 at 18:00 GMT. Learn more in our previously published article. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know from the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct here. Jump directly to each section to learn more: Warcraft RTS, Hearthstone, Warcraft Rumble, World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft Classic, World of Warcraft: The War Within. It’s been 30 years since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans made its debut, setting the path for so many stories and adventures that have come after. To continue these adventures in the Warcraft series, we’ve released Patch 2.0— now available for all Warcraft III: Reforged players. The patch overhauls environments, lighting, and the user interface. It also introduces uprezzed classic Warcraft III assets to HD, allowing players to choose and customize their graphical experience. Mix and match assets as you wish. There are also new quality-of-life improvements such as in-game hotkey customization, updated ladder, and much much more. Beyond the update for Warcraft III: Reforged, we’re happy to announce the release of fully remastered versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II, taking you beyond Orcs and Humans, the Tides of Darkness, and the Dark Portal for the first time, again. Players will be able to switch between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time. We’ve also added more modern controls to Warcraft I, such as right-click move, band box select, and faster game speed. Both Warcraft I and II also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and health bars, a mission select screen, and increased unit selection. Warcraft II will continue to have multiplayer functionality, and all legacy custom maps will remain fully compatible and playable. Travel back in time to experience each of these titles once more or— for the very first time— by visiting the shop: Warcraft I: Remastered, Warcraft II: Remastered, Warcraft III: Reforged. You’ll never forget the first time you hear “zug zug.” We’ve also brought back the Battle Chest, allowing players to purchase all three games in one bundle. For those who already purchased Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft®: II Battle.net® edition, or Warcraft III: Reforged from the Battle.net shop, the bundle will be available at a discount. Early next year, Hearthstone is going beyond Warcraft and into... Heroes of StarCraft! This special Mini-Set will have a whopping 49 new cards across three themed factions, which show what the StarCraft universe would look like in the Hearthstone Tavern. Each faction is made up of cards that can be used across multiple classes, including an iconic Hero card. Zerg Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Hunter, and Warlock have joined the Zerg! Led by the formidable Sarah Kerrigan, they will have aggressive cards that win the game by swarming the board. Protoss Druid, Mage, Priest, and Rogue fight for the Protoss Empire. Led by the High Templar Artanis, they will have powerful, high-cost cards that are made cheaper throughout the game. Terran Paladin, Shaman, and Warrior make up the Terran forces, lead by the one and only Jim Raynor. They will command Battlecruisers—a special take on the Starship mechanic from The Great Dark Beyond. The Mini-Set will feature a slew of StarCraft units which are sure to invoke nostalgia, as well as the Terran-armored Murloc, Grunty, and new, thematic music. You can chart a course for the Heroes of StarCraft Mini-Set, launching in January 2025! More announcements, details, and card reveals are coming closer to launch. Then, for the first time in 10 years, Arena Mode is getting a major overhaul. With that update, there will be two kinds of Arena to choose from. Normal Arena will be shorter form, allowing you to complete your runs more quickly. Competitive Arena players will be able to play in the higher-stakes Underground Arena, with longer runs and a new feature: Re-Draft on Loss. Re-Draft on Loss means that, after you lose, you’ll have the option to re-draft cards, edit your deck, and keep your run alive. Ratings will also be added to both Normal and Underground Arena. Normal, skill-based matchmaking will be used for Normal Arena. Underground Arena throws caution to the wind and lets you face off against opponents of all skill levels. This major Arena revamp is coming in the first half of next year. Look out for more details about this update closer to when it goes live. On top of those updates, Hearthstone has an exciting year of expansions ahead, with much-requested themes, locations, and familiar faces across Azeroth. In the first expansion of the year, enter the Emerald Dream and join the battle between the Old Gods and the Druids of the Emerald Dream for the fate of the World Tree. Things will heat up even more when the Druids of the Flame light up the Mini-Set (releasing earlier than normal this year, during the 32.2 Patch). The second expansion of the year will be Hearthstone’s first-ever sequel: the return to Un’Goro Crater! Join Elise on a hunt for a mythical, lost Tortollan city. When you find it, join the Tortollans in a festival to celebrate the mighty dinosaurs of the crater in the 33.4 Mini-Set. In the third expansion of the year, travel with Chromie through alternate realities to recruit Legendary Warcraft heroes like you’ve never seen them before. Leading to the 34.4 Mini-Set: an epic showdown against Murozond at the end of time! It’s been one year since Warcraft Rumble went live. To celebrate, players can log in to Warcraft Rumble today and join the one-year anniversary celebration in game. Players can collect daily rewards, including new avatars and cosmetics! The Warcraft universe is built on rich and diverse characters that may not fit into any singular family, and because of this, we’re introducing split Leaders! In Season 10, we reintroduce Sylvanas Windrunner as the first playable split Leader, honoring her allegiance to both the Horde and Undead families. Later, we will introduce Malfurion Stormrage as Alliance and Cenarion, Orgrim Doomhammer as Horde and Blackrock, and last but not least, Anub’arak as Undead and Beast. Warcraft Rumble is coming to PC! The PC beta will launch on December 10, 2024; stay tuned for more information! World of Warcraft celebrates 20 years of adventure in Azeroth, bringing together players of all ages and abilities from all over the world, making connections both in the game and out. Inspired by the incredible story captured in “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin” documentary about Mats “Ibelin” Steen—now live on Netflix— a Norwegian WoW® player who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, you can add the Reven Pack to your collection and support CureDuchenne, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and extending the lives of those affected by this disease. Live now in modern World of Warcraft, players can join the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration to collect updated Tier 2 armor appearance sets, undertake Classic Timewalking, engage with others to defeat iconic world bosses, head to the Trading post, and earn iconic new rewards, and more. The War Within has taken the leap into the first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga and adventures continue in WoW Classic, but this is only the beginning of what we have planned. Currently, in Season of Discovery, players are exploring new adventures with new class abilities, all-new level-up raids, finding secrets, and teaming up to defeat Ragnaros and Nefarian. It won’t be long until everyone can join the War Effort and open the gates to Ahn’Qiraj, where they’ll get to plunder the depths for new rewards and face new challenges. After Ahn’Qiraj, players in Season of Discovery can look forward to one more phase, in which they’ll face the dangers of Naxxramas, along with new instanced content featuring the Scarlet Crusade as well as adventures in Deadwind Pass! In Cataclysm Classic, Ragnaros has risen in the Firelands once more, and players are working toward adding the Dragonwrath Staff to their collection. In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year. And that’s not all we have in store for Classic World of Warcraft. We’re pleased to announce that Mists of Pandaria Classic will be arriving in the summer of 2025, taking players back to the shores of Pandaria and bringing its legendary class design, incredible raids and dungeons, stunning environments, and (of course) an unforgettable soundtrack. Relive the World of Warcraft Classic experience with all-new fresh realms in the WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition arriving November 21. Join players on a whole new journey to level 60, with the first raid dungeon, Molten Core, becoming available a few weeks after launch. Choose to play on a PvP realm, a Normal PvE realm, or (for the very first time) a Hardcore realm progressing through content with the other realms — all from the beginning, with fresh economies, on very large realms. These realms will launch with some of the quality-of-life features that came later in the WoW Classic cycle, such as the Chronoboon Displacer to save your world buffs and the improved PvP Honor Ranking system. The PvP and Normal PvE realms will also progress into Burning Crusade Classic! It's never too late to go back and re-experience World of Warcraft anew—just in time to celebrate 20 years of adventures in Azeroth! The first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga kicked off in August with the launch of The War Within, bringing with it myriad new experiences with a new raid, dungeons, delves, PvP, new appearances and rewards, pets, mounts and much more. On the horizon, our next content update, Siren Isle, is currently available on the Public Test Realms (PTR), and the update will go live next month with a little something for everyone. This update also includes the epilogue questline for Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. No spoilers, but the storyline will feature the mysterious haranir, who also starred in the expansion release cinematic. The Siren Isle introduces a new outdoor environment to explore, full of mysteries to uncover and rewards to help catch your alternate characters up and prepare for the next War Within season ahead. Plunderstorm is returning with a new Plunderstore to provide more flexibility for earning rewards instead of a linear Renown track. There are also some quality-of-life changes to spell interactions, the UI and more ahead. The Siren Isle content update also brings with it Turbulent Timeways once more and additional updates to the Feast of Winter Veil in-game holiday event. We’re introducing a new novella that explores more of the story behind the scenes. Find out what happened with Jaina and Thrall after the Fall of Dalaran as they seek out reinforcements in this five-chapter special— available today and as read by Chris Metzen! Listen and read here. Xal’atath’s trail leads adventurers to a location in our next major content update that has long been known about but, as yet, remained unexplored—the Undermine. Players will travel deep into the goblin city of Undermine, the capital of the goblin’s trade empire! It is a city like none other seen before in World of Warcraft and stands as a testament to goblin intelligence and creativity as experts in both technology and alchemy. As our adventures continue, we’ll learn more about goblin culture and society that we have never been able to see before. We’ll learn what’s important to them, the problems they are trying to solve —everything that makes them truly unique, and what they’re capable of as a society. We’ll dig a bit deeper beyond just their humor and explosions, though there will still be explosions and a LOT of mayhem to be found. You’ll arrive in an Undermine that’s in conflict between the four major goblin cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company. Each cartel is run by notorious goblins like Monte Gazlowe, Renzik “The Shiv,” Baron Revilgaz, Marin Noggenfogger, and more. Which one you align yourself with is up to you. You’ll want to make sure you have a sweet ride to roll around town in— players can earn a customizable vehicle early on that’s designed just for use in Undermine. You’ll push the boundaries of locomotion on the roads of Undermine and speed through its causeways and byways at a higher rate than a ground mount can. Players can adjust the car’s driving characteristics by adding a little extra grip to hug the roads or adjust to slide and glide as they drift around corners. Want to accelerate faster? Then, you may have to sacrifice a little speed. How you customize your car’s characteristics is up to you. The new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, builds on the narrative of Undermine as players race to stop a group of goblins from blowing a dam that will bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This new dungeon will be available immediately as a part of the new The War Within Season 2 dungeon pool on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+, alongside the four other launch dungeons and three legacy dungeons. We’ll share more information on the full slate of dungeons at a later point, but we would be remiss if we didn’t include MOTHERLODE from Battle for Azeroth in the rotation. Players will also experience two new Delves and variations of existing Delves in the content update. Seasonal updates are also being introduced to Brann Bronzebeard, a new adversary to follow, Zek’vir, and a new set of goblin-inspired Curios. Experience a new 8-boss raid dungeon that takes you through the city streets and into the magnificent Gallagio— brimming with color and extravagance, it houses the dark secrets of its owner— Gallywix. There’s more at play here than it first seems, and goblin politics are treacherous and fraught with the underpinnings of something more where Xal’atath is concerned. There’s even more ahead in 2025, and we have the roadmaps to help guide you on what you can look forward to in World of Warcraft and WoW Classic. Thank you for making Azeroth your home over these last two decades. Speaking of home, the World of Warcraft team has one last thing to share with you… And yes, in World of Warcraft: Midnight, your next adventure begins at home. A house to call your very own. Stay tuned! Wherever your gaming experience takes you, we can’t wait to continue on this journey with you all. Lok’tar ogar! We’ll see you at the Inn, in Azeroth, and wherever the road takes us all next!

The company had been working to launch a fertility monitoring device and companion smartphone app for the past four years as part of a project codenamed "Encore," said the people, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak to the press. The team sat within Amazon's Grand Challenge, also known as its Special Projects division, the sources said. In October, Amazon told people working on the tracker that it was disbanding the team. Those being laid off will remain on Amazon's payroll until Dec. 27, but won't be expected to work during that time, according to documents reviewed by CNBC. If staffers don't secure another job by that date, Amazon will provide them with a "lump sum" severance payment equal to one week of salary for every six months of tenure at the company, the documents said. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been reeling in costs companywide since late 2022, when inflationary pressures and rising interest rates led to a slowdown across the tech and consumer markets. In addition to slashing more than 27,000 jobs, Jassy has shuttered several projects, ranging from a roving sidewalk robot to a telehealth offering and a rapid delivery service. The wave of frugality marks a distinct departure from the approach taken by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Jassy's predecessor, who was known for greenlighting experimental projects and giving employees extended runway to develop them, even if they burned cash along the way. Grand Challenge was one of the hallmarks of that era. Bezos launched Grand Challenge in 2014 as a way for Amazon to tinker with riskier projects that may or may not see the light of day. Grand Challenge was the brains behind a pair of connected eyeglasses equipped with Amazon's Alexa voice assistant and a machine learning tool for analyzing medical records. Other Grand Challenge projects, including the Amazon Care telehealth service, a video-calling device for kids, a virtual tours service, and an augmented reality headset for meetings, were discontinued. On the morning of Oct. 28, employees working on the fertility tracker were told to join a videoconference where a director of the team informed them that the project was ending. The call lasted about two minutes, one of the people said. A layoff notice viewed by CNBC was signed by Doug Weibel, who took over as the head of Grand Challenge after its founding leader, Babak Parviz, left in 2022 and joined Madrona Venture Group. Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, confirmed the layoffs and the existence of the project in a statement to CNBC. Roughly 100 employees will be laid off, Callahan confirmed. "We regularly review our businesses to ensure we focus on areas where we can make the biggest difference for customers," Callahan said. "Following a recent review, we've decided to discontinue this project within Grand Challenge, and we're working directly with employees whose roles are impacted to support them through the transition and help them find other opportunities within Amazon." The project was born out of the company's 2020 acquisition of Wisconsin-based startup bluDiagnostics, the sources said. BluDiagnostics was founded in 2015 by Weibel, Katie Brenner and Jodi Schroll, all of whom joined Grand Challenge. The startup had developed a thermometer-like device, called FertilityFinder, to help women track their fertility from home by testing their saliva and measuring two key hormones, estradiol and progesterone. The results of the test were viewable through a corresponding app. Business Insider reported on aspects of the fertility device in 2022, when its codename was Project Tiberius. The team was working to develop its own saliva collection device and mobile app, which could predict when a user might be in the fertile window. Users could also log their period symptoms, sexual activity and other data to assist with tracking their fertility. There are similar offerings on the market from companies including Inne, Oova, Ava and Mira, along with fertility and ovulation tracking apps such as Flo, Clue and Max Levchin's Glow. Amazon initially aimed to release the product this year, but the timing was pushed out after the team encountered technical issues with the device, one of the people said. It was a costly endeavor and required significant upfront investments for lab research and development, in addition to the high salaries for scientists and engineers, the sources said, adding that the team's weekly overhead was roughly $1.5 million. Amazon didn't comment on the figure. Only one project now remains active within Grand Challenge. Its focus is on health tech, the people said.

Title: AMD is laying off workers as it focuses on AI

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.87%) is cutting 4% of its global workforce as it focuses on competition in the artificial intelligence chips space. “As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” a spokesperson for AMD said in a statement shared with Quartz on Wednesday. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.” The cuts target sales and marketing roles in some divisions including consumer PC and gaming PC, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The company is reportedly still hiring. AMD shares fell by around 2.3% during mid-day trading on Wednesday. In October, AMD reported third-quarter revenues of $6.8 billion — slightly above Wall Street’s expectations. “Looking forward, we see significant growth opportunities across our data center, client and embedded businesses driven by the insatiable demand for more compute,” AMD chief executive Lisa Su said in a statement. Earlier that month, AMD launched its Instinct MI325X accelerators and Ryzen AI PRO 300 series processors, along with other leading-edge computing chips, at its Advancing AI conference. Like rival Nvidia (NVDA-4.19%), AMD is on “an annual cadence” with releasing new chips, Su said. “The data center and AI represent significant growth opportunities for AMD, and we are building strong momentum for our EPYC and AMD Instinct processors across a growing set of customers,” Su said. With its new chips, AMD is “delivering leadership compute to power our customers’ most important and demanding workloads,” she added. By 2028, AMD sees the market for data center AI accelerators reaching $500 billion, Su said, adding that the chipmaker is “committed to delivering open innovation at scale through our expanded silicon, software, network and cluster-level solutions.” This story has been updated to include a statement from AMD.

Title: How Vivek Ramaswamy Became A Billionaire
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2024/11/13/how-vivek-ramaswamy-became-a-billionaire/
Time Published: 2024-11-13T19:39:20Z
Full Content:
UPDATE, November 13, 2024: On November 12, a week after Donald Trump won the presidential election, he named billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy as co-heads of a new entity, the Department of Government Efficiency. Already nicknamed DOGE, it is tasked with cutting wasteful expenditures, slashing excessive regulations and restructuring federal agencies. “This is truly a once-in-a-century opportunity. We will be radically transparent about the government waste we uncover,” Ramaswamy posted on X on Thursday, November 13. Here’s the inside story—first published by Forbes in August 2023—on how Ramaswamy, the lesser known and less rich Musk counterpart, made his own billion-dollar fortune. Standing in a packed New Hampshire restaurant, Vivek Ramaswamy, the fresh-faced Republican shaking up the 2024 presidential race, is making a case for unifying a bitterly divided nation. The secret, he insists, is as American as apple pie: capitalism. “Democrats and Republicans alike, we tend to be more proud of a country when we’re all making more money in that country,” he tells 100 or so diners enjoying turkey sandwiches and diet Cokes. “We don’t have to flog ourselves for capitalism. Stop apologizing for capitalism. We should embrace capitalism.” Ramaswamy certainly has. At 38 years old, the biotech investor and “anti-woke” warrior is worth more than $950 million. His net worth was over $1 billion about a week ago, making him one of the 20 youngest billionaires in the country, before a downturn in the market pulled him just under the billion-dollar threshold, according to Forbes’ calculations. Still, he appears to be the second-wealthiest person competing in the Republican presidential primary, behind only Donald Trump (whose net worth Forbes last pegged at $2.5 billion). Ramawamy’s fortune stems from a drug-development company named Roivant Sciences, which went public in 2021. Its stock is up nearly 40% this year, boosting the value of Ramaswamy’s 10% stake to roughly $600 million. Since founding the company nine years ago, he has sucked over $260 million out of Roivant in the form of salary, bonuses and capital gains. He diversified those proceeds into a pretty standard investment portfolio, roughly 60% stocks and 40% bonds. But he also added some flavor, with a dash of Bitcoin and Ethereum, some shares of YouTube competitor Rumble and a stake in crypto payments firm MoonPay. Then there are his political interests. In 2021, Ramaswamy stepped down as CEO of Roivant and got into politics, authoring a book called “Woke, Inc.,” which criticized corporate America’s growing focus on social justice issues and the ESG (environmental, social and governance) movement taking over Wall Street. A year later, he founded an “anti-woke” index fund provider—think BlackRock, without all the talk about saving the world—named Strive Asset Management. Investors recently valued Strive at a lofty $300 million or so, according to two individuals familiar with the financing, implying that Ramaswamy’s stake is worth well over $100 million. It’s a lot of money to make in a little amount of time. The son of Indian immigrants—Ramaswamy’s father an engineer and patent attorney, his mother a psychiatrist—he attended Harvard, where he studied biology and cofounded StudentBusinesses.com, a website for student founders to pitch professional investors. A private charity reportedly bought the company in 2009 for an undisclosed sum. After graduating, Ramaswamy joined the hedge fund QVT, where he specialized in pharmaceutical investments. He earned $7 million in the first seven years of his career and made partner by 28. Around the same time, he met his now-wife, Apoorva, a throat surgeon. While continuing to work, he also managed to get a degree from America’s most prestigious law school, Yale. Ramaswamy left his job at QVT at 29 and, with the hedge fund backing him, started an investment holding company named Roivant Sciences. His thesis: Pharma giants had plenty of abandoned drugs that could be worth a fortune if someone focused on them. One year after founding the company, one of Roivant’s spinoffs, named Axovant, went public at a $2.2 billion valuation. Its prized asset: a much-hyped Alzheimer’s drug candidate, Intepirdine, which Ramaswamy had purchased for just $5 million. The year that Axovant joined the New York Stock Exchange, Ramaswamy reported more than $38 million of income, most of it from capital gains, on his tax return. Intepirdine turned out to be a disappointment, failing a clinical trial two years later. The company rebranded as Sio Gene Therapies in 2020 and is now worth about $30 million. But Ramaswamy had other drugs, too. In 2020, Japanese pharma giant Sumitomo Dainippon paid $3 billion to acquire five of them, as well as a 10% stake in Roivant. Ramaswamy got his second big windfall that year, reporting $176 million of income on his tax return, including $174.5 million in capital gains. Flush with cash, Ramaswamy stepped down from his company in January 2021, citing his “increasing public engagement” in a note to shareholders. He published his book seven months later and started the “anti-woke” asset management firm, Strive, around the same time. “We stand for this movement that we call ‘excellence capitalism,’ as a counterpart to stakeholder capitalism,” Ramaswamy explained on the Trillions podcast. “What excellence capitalism says is, focus exclusively on delivering excellent products and services to your customers, above all other agendas, including political and social agendas. And that’s different from stakeholder capitalism, which says you’re supposed to take into account 12 or 20 stakeholders at the same time.” A lineup of serious investors bankrolled Strive. Mega-donor Peter Thiel, who backed other “anti-woke” ventures like Rumble, put in some money. So did hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who has invested heavily in the pharmaceutical industry and connected with Ramaswamy playing tennis. Joe Lonsdale, the 40-year-old cofounder of Palantir, chipped in, too. Despite all his money and connections, Ramaswamy looks pretty comfortable doing meet-and-greet politicking in New Hampshire. It helps, he says, that he doesn’t live like a tycoon. “I don’t think we have lived a lifestyle that is radically removed from the one we grew up in.” He owns two Ohio homes worth a combined $2.5 million, less than the real estate portfolios of far-less-wealthy candidates, including Nikki Haley, Francis Suarez, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and President Joe Biden. “We don’t have giant vacation homes,” Ramaswamy says. “We see five of our neighbors’ backyards. We have good relationships with our neighbors.” The exception, he concedes, is private air travel. He owns stakes in three private jets, which allows him to hop-scotch across the country and still make it back home to spend time with his wife and two young children in Ohio. “If we could buy time, we would buy time,” he says. “And that’s the only thing private aviation buys us. Time with family.” Voters seem to recognize that Ramaswamy inhabits a different stratosphere. In Milford, an older woman thanked him for visiting “us cow-town people” in New Hampshire. “Oh c’mon,” the billionaire presidential candidate responded, looking a little embarrassed. “I’m one of you.” He’s not, of course. Which is part of the appeal.

Sign up for my newsletter to be among the first to learn of upcoming titles! by Andrew Dana Hudson EPUB MOBI Content warning: brief mention of suicide ideation There were skips and there were strats. Luckless didn’t have a head for strats, so he focused on finding skips. He found Ohio Truck Skip: an armored car left unlocked while the driver stopped for a pastry. Pull up, pop the back, grab a bag, peel off—easy $350K starter cash, accessible in the first days of the game. The RNG on that driver behavior was pretty good, and the pastry shop was in Zanesville, right off I-70, which made Ohio Truck Skip a favorite stop for midwest-spawned players headed east to run Wall Street strats. Sometimes those players sent him tips, and Luckless could splurge on malt liquor from the corner bodega or a sushi-burrito delivered from across town. Not exactly five-star filet mignon, like he ate late in his runs, but a nice change from ramen packets and chocolate protein powder, a nice bit of income his student loan creditors hadn’t yet figured out how to garnish. A lot of skips were like Truck Skip: money you could grab quick and get away with. On Economic Victory runs, the quicker you got out of the prole stage, got some real investment capital, the quicker you could start amassing actual wealth, work your way up to being the richest person in the world. Most of the best EV Any% players didn’t bother to start with wage jobs or uni at all. They just strung together a bunch of early skips, laundered the cash, bought a fully credentialed identity, and then got on with the real game. That’s where the timesave was—when you made more money in a day than proles made in a year or a lifetime. Skips also helped players make real runs out of more of their spawns. Luckless got a lot of cred for finding skips that helped you get-rich-quick even if you started the game way off the beaten path. He found Kawaihae Timeshare Skip: a remote Hawaiian beach house that could be looted in the off-season for $170K worth of paintings and rugs. He found Chihuahua Tell Skip: a drunk drug lord who would give $100K to a tourist willing to balance a melon on their head for shooting practice; risky, but Luckless only died a third of the time. He even found Lonely Lubbock Lady Skip: a dying spinster in a Texas hospice who would make you heir to her $50mil wind farm business if you read 1980s erotica to her during her final ten days—though naysayers on the forums argued that liquidating the farm was onerous enough that this should really be considered more of a starter play for a clean energy strat. “You find the best, most boring-ass shit, my dude,” his friend Articumyo35 said after Luckless logged Toronto Tree Skip. “Let’s goooo,” Luckless said in thanks, and he spammed RetroKappa faces into their chat. Privately, Luckless disagreed with Articumyo’s characterization. He didn’t think his skips were boring. After all, wandering the world freely, finding pockets of easy money—that was exactly the kind of thing he didn’t get to do IRL. In real life, his on-shift movements through the warehouse were so closely monitored that he’d be docked for taking more than two steps off the optimal path. In real life, he got off shift too deep-bone tired to go out with his coworker Hector—always sounding him out, trying to see how he felt about their algo bosses—too fried to do anything but trudge home and live a half dozen runs before sleep. That was boring-ass shit. The secrets he found in AnyLife were magic. Take Toronto Tree Skip: a tin of rare coins found nestled under knotted maple roots in Ontario’s Goodwood Conservation Area. Hawked to the right local collector, they seeded Toronto-spawns with a guaranteed $87K. But the find was so random, Luckless half-suspected he’d stumbled on a dev box, hidden by AnyLife‘s developers to help playtesters jump ahead to later stages of the game. Maybe if you took the coins to some unmarked side door in the Swiss banking district, the Illuminati would give you $20 billion, no questions asked. Used to be lots of rumors like that on the forums—trillion-dollar poker games, a gas station that on Leap Day only sold winning lotto tickets. Dev skips were rare, though, and they always got patched out as soon as they were logged. Luckless dreamed of one day finding such a single-use skip that would catapult him onto the Any% leaderboard. Some secret shortcut to Economic Victory. But if the coin collection held such game-breaking potential, he’d yet to figure it out. Toronto Tree Skip sat quietly on Luckless’s community contributions page, ticking up stars from players trying Canadian fracking strats. When he wasn’t scouting, Luckless was running. Here’s what that looked like: you slather on the electroconductive gel, hook up the halo that reroutes your nervous system, press and hold START, and boom—it’s midnight on your 18th birthday, in a different body, a different identity, a new clutch of memories swirling in your simulated hippocampus. If you’re a roleplayer or a 100%er, maybe you’d go along with whatever motivations came with that life. But if you’re a speedrunner like Luckless, you’d forget all that and head for a skip. Long days on the road bouncing from secret cache to fence to easy score to money laundry, until you have enough cash to buy and borrow and bribe your way into real capital. Then long years playing the markets or playing the board rooms, running pump-and-dumps or bear hugs or asset strips until, for at least a second, no one on the planet had more than you. After that, you lived out your years in luxury, or else you suicided out to get on with the next run. The current Economic Victory Any% record was held by JammyDeeBasterd, the best EV speedrunner in the world. Luckless’s best time didn’t even crack the top thousand. One night Luckless was watching Jammy do replay commentary on stream, and Jammy flipped to a DroPro and gave a tour of his ‘crib.’ He led the hovering camera through a mansion maze of candy kitchens, home theaters, and mini-finity pools. “Main advice I have for speedrunners is, get your IRL life just like what you wanna achieve in-game. You can’t just want the EV, you gotta know you deserve the EV. Gotta feel that blue in your blood. Gotta spend your time out the halo with people who are grinding to be the top of their industries, top of the world. I learned half my secret strats from my dad and his business partners. You gotta grind to get your company correct if you’re gonna play your runs correctly.” Bile ran slick and acid up Luckless’s throat. “Fuck this guy,” he spat. All of a sudden he wanted to stomp on Jammy’s pale, thin throat, burn his massive house down. He wanted to take everything from this rich twerp who had it so easy in this world that he sought out whole other lives to win in. Of course, Jammy lived a thousand miles away, no doubt with security that would treat Luckless just like an invasive NPC. Luckless had been rich enough times to know how impossible it was to meaningfully hurt someone with as much money as Jammy. But there was one thing Luckless could take: Jammy’s spot on the leaderboard. He didn’t know how—Luckless’s times had never come close—but he decided then and there to quit dabbling and focus up. In his best run, Jammy had become the richest person in the world in eleven years, three months, eleven days, and twenty-three hours (in-game timer)—a bizarre wunderkind story in the game. No one had ever done it faster. That night, grinding his cavities, staring in the dark at the blue-light portal of his phone screen, Luckless swore that one day soon he’d get on the leaderboard with sub-ten. Articumyo was on the leaderboard. So were Hexian and Noodle, who also frequented the Powercord server Luckless was on. “You wanna post a real run, stop dinking around in the woods and focus on your fundamentals—mergers, takeovers, and takedowns,” Noodle said. “Read real life biz books,” Articumyo agreed. “Not just run write-ups. It’s different, hearing strats from people who don’t just do this as a game.” “Like who?” Luckless asked. “Bez, Buff, Walton, Saud, Zuck, Ma. Or, I dunno, whoever you work for, right? They gotta know more than you, to be at exec-plus.” “Shit, I tried to read Lenin once,” Hexian said. “Wanted to get into the proles’ heads for better Tower Defense.” “Who’s Lenin?” Luckless flashed a stub-armed thinky-rex emoji. “Ancient Russian folk hero,” Noodle said. Tower Defense was a minigame that sometimes happened late in the exec stage or early in the plute. Prole NPCs surrounded your HQ to protest your strats. Depending on world metrics, they might even besiege the building, try to force their way up to your C Suite, and you’d have to either mobilize your guards effectively or call in mercs or cops to mow the proles down. Unlike a lot of players—including Noodle, Hexian, and Articumyo—Luckless didn’t really enjoy this minigame. But he also didn’t do so many deep EV runs that it came up that often. Which, his friends always pointed out, was why he’d never posted a sub-40 year time. Occasionally he did go drink forties with Hector, out on the old train tracks after shift, and once he told Hector about a Tower Defense run he’d done the previous night. “So in this life I had a head of security named Vincey, who had been like a badass DroneSOC guy in Guat.” “I know the type,” Hector said, and squirted a quarter-mouthful of booze out the gap of a missing front tooth. “Right? Weird hire. But I delegate to him, figure he’d task some of those police-style dogbots, the K-99s. But Vincey, I remember, he gets this crazy look in his eyes, and then out come like two hundred forklifts, just like we use on the floor. They walk out of the loading dock and just stomp all over the proles, scatter them. Wild to see, you know, the junk we work on every day out smashing skulls.” “That’s fucked up, man,” Hector said. “They’re just NPCs.” Luckless shrugged. “What, you play pacifist runs or something?” “Don’t play much at all. But nah, not a pacifist. Just couldn’t bring myself to violate a picket line, even in a fake life.” “It’s not fake,” Luckless bristled. “It’s a game. There’s a difference.” Luckless didn’t get defensive because he was particularly good at AnyLife. He knew he wasn’t, yet. He wasn’t even some genius at finding skips; he just played more scout runs than most. It was a coping mechanism. When Luckless was feeling anxious, or bored, when his mom asked him for drinking money or his landlord nosed around or the companies he did deliveries for on weekends ratcheted down his tip share another notch—well, he’d hole up in his microstudio and drop an evening on four or five lazy, no-goal lives. Cheaper than self-medicating with weed or over-the-counter antidepressants. He’d grab an easy skip, invest the money conservatively, and just while away the years hiking remote forests with a metal detector or observing NPC behavior from some café window. That’s how he found Toronto Tree Skip. Ohio Truck Skip too. And there was a lot to those lives, Luckless thought sometimes. Exploring the world, finding little secrets. The relationships he built with neighbors, his spawn-family. Not having to work. The quiet moments he found in the woods. That’s why most people played AnyLife, the most comprehensive neurodigital simulated reality game ever made. Halo up and a whole human lifetime whooshes through your brain in twenty-five minutes. Spawn at 18 to live new glory years, go to college if you want, sleep around if you want, travel, try things you were too afraid or too poor to do IRL, make art, start a family, grow old. They had the whole world in there, kind of. AnyLife‘s version of Earth was patched together from satellite photos, architectural models, all the video footage and Internet data AnyCorp devs could get their hands on. They ran this sketch of the planet through a quantum computer, which worked with your brain to fill in the details, playing off each other until it all made sense. Luckless figured there was probably a lot more to it, but he was a gamer, not a techie. All he knew was that when the credits rolled at the end of a life, and he unhooked the halo, wiped off the gel, it all still felt as real as anything. The triumphs and hardships, the pain, the wonder, the monotony, the fear, the love, even, he presumed, the death. Not that he could remember all of it. The brain can’t even keep track of one life, let alone the hundreds or thousands that dedicated AnyLife players went through. But with a little practice he could memorize the highlights, the strats that worked, the skips he found, then look them up on the replay, log his time, and post on the forums. The tricky part for Luckless was finding the time. Nine and a half hours on the clock at the warehouse, four days a week, plus unpaid breaks. An hour commute each way, ninety minutes if traffic snarled nasty. He used to carpool with his aunt’s friend Lenore, and four others, but Lenore quit the warehouse. The bus was two and a half hours each way, so Luckless got a car to save time, give him enough hours at home to do more than just a couple warm-up runs. To afford the car, he started driving deliveries and rideshares on weekends. This cut a lot into his gaming time, but he justified it by getting his friends on Powercord to tell him it was better to play some every day than long stretches just on weekends. “It’s like yoga,” Noodle confirmed. “You go once a week, you get a once-a-week practice. You go every day, that’s when you start doing upside down splits and shit.” The thing about AnyLife was—even though Luckless sometimes played it to escape—it wasn’t really escapist. It still felt like, well, life. You still had to pay your bills. You still had to get eight in-game hours of sleep a night if you didn’t want to feel like shit. You still had to shower every day if you didn’t want to smell, figure out breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, take a dump every day. Sure, you could technically do things without facing the consequences in your ‘real life,’ but the consequences in the game felt real enough while you were playing to usually act as a deterrent. There were other simulated reality games with lower fidelity that let you be an action hero or go on a rampage, turn into a tiger or a bacterium or a god. AnyLife was for gamers who wanted the unparalleled, solitary challenge of successfully navigating life as a mortal human being. This challenge got old after the first dozen lives, so hardcore gamers set themselves additional goals beyond just getting through the years and competed to see how quick they could achieve them. AnyLife developers, in their infinite marketing wisdom, had made this easy to track. For instance, becoming the world’s richest person in a life put a gold-and-diamond EV achievement badge on your player profile, along with your time: how many in-game years it took you to build a fortune, play the markets, buy an empire, grow your profits, outcompete your rivals, claw to the top of the fucking ladder. There were a few different victory condition achievements—Presidential Victory, Nobel Victory, EGOT Victory, Pope Victory—but Economic Victory was the most popular to speedrun. Within the EV community, there were a couple different philosophies. 100%ers thought the real challenge was working your way up from nothing, role-playing the whole journey from prole or petty rank up to exec, titan and plute. They had rules about how long you had to stay in the top spot and how much damage you could do to the planet and the NPC populations as you rose to power. 100%-complete EV runs were rare, and forums were full of litigation about whether run submissions had used out-of-character knowledge to cheat. Any%ers didn’t give a shit about all that. Use whatever glitchy skips you found, whatever broken strats you memorized, just get that achievement unlock fast enough and you too could be an AnyLife legend. Luckless was going to be such a legend, he’d decided, so he started gaming for real. He stopped hanging out with Hector and the other warehouse workers, stopped swiping listlessly through dating apps, stopped taking calls from his mom. He listened to strategy podcasts on his commute home, played AnyLife all evening, went to bed watching speedrun streams. He dreamed of other lives, lived and unlived, which he supposed was what all dreams were, but these were different, full of aching-yearning-taking moments in the dark, and of standing on the mountain surveying the world, a devil whispering offerings in his ear. He’d wake up sore and sweating, but he always put the halo back on for a few practice lives before work. “Damn our boy’s got a firecracker up his ass now,” Hexian said, after Luckless posted his third new personal best in a row. “Let’s goooo!” Luckless replied, with a flex gif that stacked up poggy-reacts. “Gunning for that throne.” “Gotta put in more centuries if you want a shot of that,” Noodle said. “How I do that? Don’t have the tips to quit my job.” “Fuck you think how?” Articumyo said. “Drugs.” So Luckless stopped splurging on booze and burritos, saved up for an order of the neuronutriceutical supplements that let simulated reality gamers run ten lives in an hour instead of two. The pills left him blinky, shaky, brain overclocked beyond IRL usefulness. They kept him up at night so he got less sleep and did more runs. At work, he started making mistakes, missing task cues and tripping over bots. So he got some other pills to keep him awake and steady on the job. He felt himself fraying, but his PB was steadily creeping down. Every few days, Luckless checked in on JammyDeeBasterd. Jammy always looked rested and spa-fresh. He pushed the luxurious gear his sponsors gave him: the best halo and gel, a meal-prep subscription service, a plush, sensor-laden body-care recliner. Luckless could afford exactly none of that stuff, but seeing it, seeing Jammy’s smug perfect teeth and zebra hair, it kept Luckless motivated. It hurt, but just enough to wake him up, like little hooks of jealousy dragging him out of thick fog. The rules of an official EV Any% speedrun were simple: These rules were as close as Luckless could imagine to the world being fair. The fourth rule was the roughest. You never knew where in the world you’d begin your run. You might be a Parisian socialite or a Mongolian reindeer herder, an Israeli settler or an Amazonian hunter-gatherer, a Sudanese refugee or a Chinese princeling. As long as you spawned more or less middle class in a wealthy, industrialized country, you could make a run at it. With the right skips, it didn’t make much difference if you were from Akron, Ohio or Noe Valley, San Francisco. There was always a small timesave being born to the upper class, but a middling birth needn’t make or break a run. Even with skips, however, rule four meant you played a lot of runs that really had no chance of ever getting rich. Used to be Luckless would play these lives out, just vibing, living, keeping an eye out for skips. Now if a run wasn’t working out, spawned in the wrong place or with the wrong demographics, he’d rip it. Sometimes that meant trying to grab a risky but profitable skip: a coyote crossing or a bank robbery or both. When he was spawned too remote to have a shot at some free money, ripping meant a quick jump off a cliff, if one was available. Or a bottle of pesticide, a slit wrist, a wild charge at soldiers or police. Luckless got really good at killing himself. More than once he woke up in the morning, or in the night, with a disorienting impulse to rip his own life. Everything around him screamed “spawned all wrong,” this wasn’t going anywhere, he’d be better off logging out and running it back. In a kind of digital-mental-muscle-memory-twitch, he’d start thinking about if there was drain cleaner under his sink or if he could steal painkillers from his mom, how hard it would be to get ahold of a gun. “Lmao yeah I’ve had that,” Noodle said, when Luckless jokingly mentioned his suicidal ideation. “IRL sucks hard. But then I remember, I can live whatever lives I want.” “Maybe you wanna take a break, though,” Articumyo said. “Get some brain rest or at least take some chiller runs. Scout out some skips in the woods like you used to.” “Jammy doesn’t take breaks,” Luckless objected. “Jammy doesn’t scout skips in the woods.” “Yeah, but Jammy wakes up next to, like, models and shit,” Hexian said. “Has a personal trainer to keep his stamina up and neurochemistry right. You gotta play your real life to win, too.” But in real life, the warehouse algo had started docking mistakes from Luckless’s pay, and between that and the expensive supplements, he overdrafted his bank account and got behind on rent. Pretty soon he came home to eviction papers stapled to his door. “Just vanlife it, dude,” Noodle advised. “You could be like the wardrivers of old, gaming on the open road.” “I don’t have a van, though,” Luckless said. “Carlife doesn’t sound so glam.” Hector was more sympathetic. “Brother, we’re trying to fight the algo, but it’s like organizing in quicksand,” Hector said. “Retention is too low, intershop churn is too high. Policies adapt too fast to get a group grievance going, and the Feds are totally hostile to us right now. But, come to a meeting. We can pass the hat around, maybe help you make rent somewhere.” Luckless was tempted and torn. He knew he needed help, but he felt a huge whelm of shame and anger at the idea of taking charity from strangers—not when he spent most every night as a tycoon, a mogul, a jetsetting titan. He told Hector yes, but then didn’t show. Instead, Luckless tried staying at his mom’s place. After a few days, though, he caught her walking out with his AnyLife halo tucked under her arm, a CraigsPawn buyer already on the phone. In the scramble to get his gear back from her, she started screaming, “you didn’t wanna be born so bad, fine, disappear, get your fuck-fantasy-suicide-game shit out my house!” So carlife it was. Luckless had a hope that living in his car would be simpler. He’d sleep in the warehouse parking lot, wake up and walk right into work. After, he could skip the commute and do AnyLife runs in his car, tapped into the very edge of the facility’s wifi. Technically he could get fired for stealing bandwidth like this. He wasn’t the only one who camped out in the parking lot, however, so he figured the company lowkey didn’t care. With no rent to pay, he’d have more money and could stop driving on weekends, get more runs in, grind his way to the top. Reality proved more complicated. The extra money he thought he’d have evaporated into fast food and gym passes to take the occasional shower. His back started to ache from the awkward way he slept half-curled in his backseat. He thought about buying a tent to lay out long, but one evening he came out of AnyLife to find a pair of homeless guys tugging at his car’s door handles. Though they wandered off when he laid on the horn, he felt glad for the metal and glass that had protected him, and he scrapped the tent idea. In many ways this was the worst time of his life, but it was hard to feel too sorry for himself when he’d finally cracked the top100 leaderboard. “Inspired!” Articumyo called it, after Luckless gave the chat his recap. “Fuckin’ gottem,” Noodle agreed. “Our little pogbaby is all grown up into a big strong chaddaddy,” Hexian pronounced. The run had been mostly luck: born into a wealthy Italian aluminum mining family, he (though, in this life, she) had gotten in early on the third-gen vehicular battery boom, parlayed that into successful concerns in diverse energy storage. From there she bet big and hit on algae-based jet fuels, plus a risky portfolio of cryptocompanies that she hyped up on social media. It was a dangerous, aggressive strat, but she bribed off the SEC and ESMA attack dogs just long enough for her net worth to top US$4 trillion—bigger than any other plute NPC in the game at that time. The rest of that life was full of scandal and ruin, seasick fugitive years avoiding wire fraud prosecution on a yacht, three months of prison time, then decades begging for loans from old money friends, dying alone in a crumbling beach house in Naples. But AnyLife logged that twirling EV achievement icon at 18 years, 11 months, and 15 days. Worth it. Luckless was sure this represented a big level up for him. He’d hit EV plenty of times before, but mostly through long years of painstaking investment, cultivating a profitable conglomerate, followed by a few targeted assassinations of rivals. Now he realized that those conservative strats would never get him close to JammyDeeBasterd’s time, or sub-ten. So he cranked it up a notch. He stopped caring about the stability of his brief, imaginary finances—that was tedious 100%er shit. Stopped having relationships or children, unless they upped his fortune. Stopped splurging on food or vacations or any luxuries that didn’t appreciate in value. His average times got better, but he struggled to top that wondrous, manic, Italian PB. He stopped caring about laws, except to the extent that he could change them to favor his business, get regulations out of the way of his accumulation. As a plute, he could buy out the mercs of most any enemy. Governments, however, with their nationalism and monopoly on violence, still had loyal enforcers who could arrest him or haul him off to testify before Congress or Parliament, which was a real drag. So he did everything he could to undermine and destroy nationstates and the middle classes that gave them power. He PBed again, by about seven months, this time as a prodigious Qatari oil baron, whose spies and botnets suppressed global climate talks just long enough for his toxic fossil assets to spike on skittish markets. He stopped paying taxes. He nearly stopped paying his employees. Jammy might have IRL experience with the upper crust, but Luckless knew all about how bosses and algos could control workers, manipulate workers, overclock workers, steal from workers. He got really good at Tower Defense, crushing strikers with drones and mercs, sending infiltrating agents to sow discord. Still, even though he sometimes inched up the leaderboard, he never got close to Jammy’s miraculous 11 year time. For that he didn’t just have to be ruthless and reckless and play his strats perfectly, he had to be insanely lucky too—and luck, of course, was never something he’d been able to count on. It took something out of Luckless, going to work every day and being that cruel every night. He knew it was just a game, but a part of him felt like he was betraying some bond with his coworkers. Not quite the in-joke-filled friendship with his Powercord buddies, nor the bad-but-thick blood with his mom—but rather a sense that, no matter how many lives he lived off the clock, on the clock he and they shared a common fate. Sometimes he would stand atop his HQ tower, watching the proles clash with his security, and he would see his coworkers’ faces in the mob. Jennette, shaking her hand-scrawled protest sign. Bix, their eyes red with tear gas. Lenore, kettled by the cops. Hector, his ribs crushed by a headless dogbot. “You okay, brother?” Hector asked. Luckless found himself lying on his back in the middle of the warehouse floor. No halo was on his head, but somehow he felt like he’d been someone else, living some other life. He desperately wished he still was. Hector’s rough hand gripped his arm, hauled him up. For a second Luckless wanted to tell Hector everything, but what was there to tell? That no matter how he tried, he couldn’t get rich enough fast enough? Join the fuckin’ club, Hector would probably say. That he could dominate the whole world, just not quite as quick as this other guy? All that was just a game. The display of his work goggles flashed with insistent tasks, the algo ticking down the seconds until it docked his pay. Luckless shook off Hector’s hand and stumbled back to work. The next morning, a manager he’d never seen before, perhaps some agent contracted by the algo, called him off the floor. “Funny, I never thought someone who lived in the parking lot could be late for work so often. Yet here we are.” The manager smiled through big, perfect teeth. Teeth like Jammy’s, Luckless thought, or almost. Teeth that wanted to be like Jammy’s. “We understand that our associates will occasionally go through personal difficulties, especially in uncertain times. But when those difficulties impact floor performance and safety, they become bigger than one person.” Luckless wondered what it was like to be middle management. With skips, he’d rarely had to spend much time there. A demoralizing station, he thought, helping control the proles on behalf of execs, yet getting mere crumbs of capital in return. “Your metrics are in bad shape. You are very close to losing your hours and getting put on a no-renew list. Understand?” Luckless nodded, disassociating hard. A corner of his mind churned through the impacts losing the warehouse job would have on his speedrunning. He could drive deliveries again to pay for food, but for that he’d have to clean his car, rent a storage locker for the suitcases that contained the possessions his mother hadn’t managed to pawn. And he’d need to find bandwidth powerful enough to handle simulated reality. “But there’s a way you can help yourself. We’re willing to give you another chance and a clean slate, reset your metrics. Interested?” “Okay,” Luckless said. Anything to get him out of this little room, back to the safety and sanctuary of AnyLife. “We know you’ve been approached by Hector Lopez,” the manager said, still smiling, teeth unblinking. “Next time he offers, we’d like you to take him up on the meeting.” A shiver of warning began to tug Luckless’s attention back to reality. “Just go and listen. Try to take note of who attends. Then you and I will have a conversation after about how it went. Could you do that?” Luckless didn’t answer. The company wanted him to be a spy. He’d done plenty of corporate espionage in his runs, but this was different. The request sank like a stone to the bottom of his gut, pulling him down. “It’s important for us to be able to understand and anticipate anything that might impact future workflows. Like if associates have grievances they aren’t taking through the proper channels, or if they are trying to involve outside actors in company business. You can understand how disruptive that would be, for everyone, right?” Luckless nodded. He knew he needed to nod to keep his job, his life, afloat. “So what do you say? Can you be a team player?” Luckless hesitated, then nodded a third time. “Okay.” The rest of the day ticked by slow, the hours on the clock feeling longer than any simulated life he’d ever lived. He moved boxes from bot to shelf and shelf to bot. He sat, ass-numb, in the forklift, carrying pallets with shuddering steps. He kept his head down, avoiding Hector’s eye, and the worried gazes of his coworkers. After his shift was done, he crawled into his car and chewed a protein bar. He couldn’t think what he’d do with his life if he didn’t play turncoat and lost his job. But he didn’t know if he could live with himself if he did. Mechanically, the way he did whenever he needed to escape the bleakness of IRL, Luckless daubed gel onto his temples, closed his eyes, and held START. When he opened them, her small, brown hands were stocking cans on grocery shelves. It was her birthday, of course, but she was mostly worried about when she’d find time to study for her GED, how late the buses were running after midnight, whether her mother had been sober enough to feed baby Diwa before bed. The algo in her earbuds beeped at her to pick up the pace. Normally, Luckless would drop the can, shed the earbuds, steal a car, and head to the nearest skip he could remember. Tonight she was in Columbus, so Ohio Truck Skip wasn’t far. From there it would be routine to buy her way into the underworld, get a new identity that could make money moves, never have to do manual labor or think about where she came from ever again. In her back, her feet, her arms, she felt that deep-bone tired. The same tired Luckless felt every day of that one, unskippable life. She finished work and rode the bus home, nursed her baby, and slept. The next morning she got out early, went to the diner across from the grocery, where a few of her coworkers were gathering to talk about organizing a union. Years passed for Luckless in a different kind of power struggle. Instead of stealing, trading, gambling, and killing to get to the top, she spent a lot of time in meetings. She dissected how the boss’s algos stole their time and made them unsafe, and she discussed what they’d want to change. She learned the rules and rigors of workplace democracy—all while stocking shelves every night, raising little Diwa every day. She signed an authorization card, got a few others to do the same. She voted yes in the shop election. They lost. The company had flooded workers’ earbuds with anti-union threats and propaganda. She was fired. She got another job, another grocery, found others to organize with, started over again. This time they moved faster, more carefully. They won. They demanded a contract. The bosses ignored them, set the algos to be more cruel. They voted to strike. She brought Diwa to the picket line, held her and two other babies, chanted and sang in the blazing sun, ate pizza sent by Teamsters, caught a black eye from a scab and gave one in return. But she didn’t have the money to not work forever—none of them did. Like a sagging mattress, their strike collapsed. She went back to work, then was laid off. She found new, worse work. She tried again, failed again. She grew old, had a heart attack, survived, stopped working, moved into Diwa’s tiny apartment. She taught her grandchildren Tagalog and told them to respect a picket line. She had another heart attack and died in her bed. Luckless came out of the game flushed and out of breath. It had been an exhausting life, no spa days or yacht dives or cocaine. But then, he’d done no nihilistic economic violence, no murder, he’d barely even lied. He didn’t bother to take the halo off and regel. He just popped a nutraceutical and jammed START again. This time Luckless was white and almost middle class. He went to college, became a teacher, paid out of pocket to ship his students art supplies. His union was strong, but the plutes were swiftly dismantling public education. He marched on Washington, but the bill they demanded never passed. He quit teaching and went to grad school, joined a nonprofit, spent a decade chasing grants and reporting pyrrhic progress. In many ways this felt worse than being the grocery worker. He drove home drunk and wrapped his car around a telephone pole. Next he was a Spanish dockworker, next a Nigerian miner. He led strikes and caught a merc’s bullet to the head. He was a Louisianan postal worker, a Canadian nurse, a Brazilian farm laborer. He ran for office, lost, ran again, lost, ran again, won, was arrested by the junta and died in prison. He was a Korean programmer, a Swedish lawyer, a Caribbean bank teller. He leaked data about the plutes’ tax avoidance, then was taken out by balaclava-clad men waiting in the dark of his flat. Each time he came to in his car, it was a little later, his body and brain a little more tired and wired. He was taking twice as many pills as normal, and the hours were draining away toward dawn. But he kept going back in, living out every life he was given, never taking a skip or a shortcut. He wasn’t trying to get rich—he was trying to change things. Sometimes he succeeded, in small but meaningful ways. Most of the time he didn’t, he lost hard, or he simply surfed the churn of class war, giving and receiving solidarity, serving and toiling, filling his lives with a kind of meaning that came not from triumph in competition but from being one with a great mass of people all struggling for a better day. When it happened, Luckless never knew if it was something he did, or some quirk of RNG. There was just something in the air this time around, the world on a precipice. He was still so young when the general strike was called—an organizing feat so massive and dangerous that in most lives it had seemed impossible. He hopped a turnstile and rode the train to Manhattan, met with his union brothers and sisters, and other comrades, thousands and thousands of them. Among them were NPCs of all ages, many of whom had never walked a picket before but nonetheless knew, from instinct or experience, that the rich kept getting richer by immiserating the poor. It was an incredible crowd, all of whom, to one degree or another, through work or talk or books or social media, had come to something resembling class consciousness. They surrounded the towers where the plutes ran the world, and Luckless looked up at the high windows and knew what was coming. Cops in black and blue marched up the avenues—class traitors all fearful and ashamed and hungry for blood. Mercs guarded the tower doors. Drones swarmed overhead. Bestial bots massed in uncanny stillness. Everything was against them, Luckless knew: all the money and all the violence it could buy. Standing against that was so much harder than making the money or ordering the violence or becoming the richest, cruelest plute in the world. But just this once, the proles had the numbers. There were so many of them. Some proles fought the cops and bots and fell. Some sat in peaceful resistance and were struck down too. More proles saw this and joined them, more workers shed their earbuds and goggles and added their bodies to the crowd. They deployed shifting tactics, improvised weapons: lasers, umbrellas, signal jammers, hashtags, live streams, molotovs, bricks and phalanxes. They held back the cops and broke through the mercs, entered the tower and occupied it floor by floor. Luckless felt an ecstasy like he’d never experienced before, in all his lives, felt freshly born, felt a kind of high communion, a great throbbing kinship with all those who produced and harvested, who delivered and maintained, who taught and cared and made the world prosper, and who were now striking all at once in their billions. Of course, that was not the end of it. There were weeks of occupation, months of struggle, all of which seemed so much longer and richer than a dozen centuries of shallow, speedrun lives. Luckless was not special in this life, not a leader. He didn’t try to be. But he was elected, nonetheless, to attend the New International, to draw up treaties and wipe away borders, to figure out how they could take the great wealth of the world and give it to all people, all at once. He lived a long life as a worker and a politician, both at the same time, as an artist and a scholar and a teacher and a parent. He died surrounded by family and comrades, old and satisfied but still wishing he could have more, for his life had been dignified and full. The sun was shining when he took off the halo. He stared out his car window, sore and empty. Out of habit, he checked his run stats. There in the achievements, a spinning diamond on his phone screen, was the Economic Victory emblem, and a log time: nine years, five months, and one day. In a daze, Luckless posted the run, saw his name jump to the top of the EV Any% leaderboard. Ahead of Noodle and Hexian and Articumyo. Ahead of JammyDeeBasterd, and everyone else who had ever played the game. He didn’t know if this was an easter egg put in by seditious game devs, some quirk or glitch of AnyLife‘s scoring, or something else, something transcendent. But it felt true. With no skips, no shortcuts, he had been, in that one revolutionary life, along with every other prole and peasant, the richest person in the world. Someone rapped on his passenger-side window. Luckless rolled it down, too tired to be embarrassed at the mess of wires and bedsheets, the stink of food wrappers and dirty clothes. Hector looked him over, concern filling his face. “You okay, brother? Bad night on your game?” “I dunno,” Luckless said. “No. It’s just a game.” Hector nodded, unconvinced. “You look rough, though. I know meetings aren’t your thing, but I’m getting together with some people before shift starts. A couple nurses will be there. One of them could look you over.” Luckless rubbed his sleepless, tired eyes. He remembered the manager’s directive. He looked at Hector’s hands, calloused like his own and like so many hands he’d worn before. “Okay,” Luckless said. “Let’s go.” _ Copyright 2023 Andrew Dana Hudson Andrew Dana Hudson is the author of Our Shared Storm: A Novel of Five Climate Futures, as well as numerous stories appearing in Slate Future Tense, Lightspeed, Terraform, and many more.

Shares of SpaceX competitor Rocket Lab USA (RKLB) soared over 40% to an all-time high in intraday trading Wednesday after the company reported results that topped estimates and announced a deal with a commercial satellite constellation operator, with the first launch of its reusable Neutron rocket slated for next year. The new contract will see Rocket Lab launch two Neutron satellite deployment missions beginning in mid-2026. The rocket is expected to make its debut launch in mid-2025, which the company says gives it an opportunity to vie for pieces of a $5.6 billion U.S. government initiative overseen by the Space Force. Requests for proposals opened on Oct. 30, and approved vehicles are expected to be on-ramped to the program in spring 2025. The company reported third-quarter revenue of $104.81 million, up 55% year-over-year and beating the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Its net loss of $51.94 million or 10 cents per share was narrower than expected. With Wednesday's surge, shares of Rocket Lab have nearly quadrupled in value in 2024. The announcement comes after competitor Elon Musk’s SpaceX was tapped by Space Force to conduct a series of missions worth $734 million in upcoming years. Rocket Lab estimates that more than 10,000 commercial and government satellites will need launch services by 2030, supporting a total addressable market of roughly $10 billion.

It’s a big year for the Warcraft universe, and whether you’re a Hearthstone fan, you’ve joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you’re a World of Warcraft player, there’s something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream. Join us for a celebration as we dip into the mana pool of nostalgia and cast far sight on the future of all things Warcraft. Viewers can watch on any Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Warcraft Rumble stream on Twitch or TikTok to earn rewards during the giveaway period from November 13 at 10:00 am PST through December 11 at 10:00 am PST. Learn more in our previously published article. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know from the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct here. Jump directly to each section to learn more: Warcraft RTS, Hearthstone, Warcraft Rumble, World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft Classic, World of Warcraft: The War Within. It’s been 30 years since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans made its debut, setting the path for so many stories and adventures that have come after. To continue these adventures in the Warcraft series, we’ve released Patch 2.0— now available for all Warcraft III: Reforged players. The patch overhauls environments, lighting, and the user interface. It also introduces uprezzed classic Warcraft III assets to HD, allowing players to choose and customize their graphical experience. Mix and match assets as you wish. There are also new quality-of-life improvements such as in-game hotkey customization, updated ladder, and much much more. Beyond the update for Warcraft III: Reforged, we’re happy to announce the release of fully remastered versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II, taking you beyond Orcs and Humans, the Tides of Darkness, and the Dark Portal for the first time, again. Players will be able to switch between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time. We’ve also added more modern controls to Warcraft I, such as right-click move, band box select, and faster game speed. Both Warcraft I and II also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and health bars, a mission select screen, and increased unit selection. Warcraft II will continue to have multiplayer functionality, and all legacy custom maps will remain fully compatible and playable. Travel back in time to experience each of these titles once more or— for the very first time— by visiting the shop: Warcraft I: Remastered, Warcraft II: Remastered, Warcraft III: Reforged. You’ll never forget the first time you hear “zug zug.” We’ve also brought back the Battle Chest, allowing players to purchase all three games in one bundle. For those who already purchased Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft®: II Battle.net® edition, or Warcraft III: Reforged from the Battle.net shop, the bundle will be available at a discount. Early next year, Hearthstone is going beyond Warcraft and into... Heroes of StarCraft! This special Mini-Set will have a whopping 49 new cards across three themed factions, which show what the StarCraft universe would look like in the Hearthstone Tavern. Each faction is made up of cards that can be used across multiple classes, including an iconic Hero card. Zerg Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Hunter, and Warlock have joined the Zerg! Led by the formidable Sarah Kerrigan, they will have aggressive cards that win the game by swarming the board. Protoss Druid, Mage, Priest, and Rogue fight for the Protoss Empire. Led by the High Templar Artanis, they will have powerful, high-cost cards that are made cheaper throughout the game. Terran Paladin, Shaman, and Warrior make up the Terran forces, lead by the one and only Jim Raynor. They will command Battlecruisers—a special take on the Starship mechanic from The Great Dark Beyond. The Mini-Set will feature a slew of StarCraft units which are sure to invoke nostalgia, as well as the Terran-armored Murloc, Grunty, and new, thematic music. You can chart a course for the Heroes of StarCraft Mini-Set, launching in January 2025! More announcements, details, and card reveals are coming closer to launch. Then, for the first time in 10 years, Arena Mode is getting a major overhaul. With that update, there will be two kinds of Arena to choose from. Normal Arena will be shorter form, allowing you to complete your runs more quickly. Competitive Arena players will be able to play in the higher-stakes Underground Arena, with longer runs and a new feature: Re-Draft on Loss. Re-Draft on Loss means that, after you lose, you’ll have the option to re-draft cards, edit your deck, and keep your run alive. Ratings will also be added to both Normal and Underground Arena. Normal, skill-based matchmaking will be used for Normal Arena. Underground Arena throws caution to the wind and lets you face off against opponents of all skill levels. This major Arena revamp is coming in the first half of next year. Look out for more details about this update closer to when it goes live. On top of those updates, Hearthstone has an exciting year of expansions ahead, with much-requested themes, locations, and familiar faces across Azeroth. In the first expansion of the year, enter the Emerald Dream and join the battle between the Old Gods and the Druids of the Emerald Dream for the fate of the World Tree. Things will heat up even more when the Druids of the Flame light up the Mini-Set (releasing earlier than normal this year, during the 32.2 Patch). The second expansion of the year will be Hearthstone’s first-ever sequel: the return to Un’Goro Crater! Join Elise on a hunt for a mythical, lost Tortollan city. When you find it, join the Tortollans in a festival to celebrate the mighty dinosaurs of the crater in the 33.4 Mini-Set. In the third expansion of the year, travel with Chromie through alternate realities to recruit Legendary Warcraft heroes like you’ve never seen them before. Leading to the 34.4 Mini-Set: an epic showdown against Murozond at the end of time! It’s been one year since Warcraft Rumble went live. To celebrate, players can log in to Warcraft Rumble today and join the one-year anniversary celebration in game. Players can collect daily rewards, including new avatars and cosmetics! The Warcraft universe is built on rich and diverse characters that may not fit into any singular family, and because of this, we’re introducing split Leaders! In Season 10, we reintroduce Sylvanas Windrunner as the first playable split Leader, honoring her allegiance to both the Horde and Undead families. Later, we will introduce Malfurion Stormrage as Alliance and Cenarion, Orgrim Doomhammer as Horde and Blackrock, and last but not least, Anub’arak as Undead and Beast. Warcraft Rumble is coming to PC! The PC beta will launch on December 10, 2024; stay tuned for more information! World of Warcraft celebrates 20 years of adventure in Azeroth, bringing together players of all ages and abilities from all over the world, making connections both in the game and out. Inspired by the incredible story captured in “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin” documentary about Mats “Ibelin” Steen—now live on Netflix— a Norwegian WoW® player who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, you can add the Reven Pack to your collection and support CureDuchenne, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and extending the lives of those affected by this disease. Live now in modern World of Warcraft, players can join the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration to collect updated Tier 2 armor appearance sets, undertake Classic Timewalking, engage with others to defeat iconic world bosses, head to the Trading post, and earn iconic new rewards, and more. The War Within has taken the leap into the first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga and adventures continue in WoW Classic, but this is only the beginning of what we have planned. Currently, in Season of Discovery, players are exploring new adventures with new class abilities, all-new level-up raids, finding secrets, and teaming up to defeat Ragnaros and Nefarian. It won’t be long until everyone can join the War Effort and open the gates to Ahn’Qiraj, where they’ll get to plunder the depths for new rewards and face new challenges. After Ahn’Qiraj, players in Season of Discovery can look forward to one more phase, in which they’ll face the dangers of Naxxramas, along with new instanced content featuring the Scarlet Crusade as well as adventures in Deadwind Pass! In Cataclysm Classic, Ragnaros has risen in the Firelands once more, and players are working toward adding the Dragonwrath Staff to their collection. In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year. And that’s not all we have in store for Classic World of Warcraft. We’re pleased to announce that Mists of Pandaria Classic will be arriving in the summer of 2025, taking players back to the shores of Pandaria and bringing its legendary class design, incredible raids and dungeons, stunning environments, and (of course) an unforgettable soundtrack. Relive the World of Warcraft Classic experience with all-new fresh realms in the WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition arriving November 21. Join players on a whole new journey to level 60, with the first raid dungeon, Molten Core, becoming available a few weeks after launch. Choose to play on a PvP realm, a Normal PvE realm, or (for the very first time) a Hardcore realm progressing through content with the other realms — all from the beginning, with fresh economies, on very large realms. These realms will launch with some of the quality-of-life features that came later in the WoW Classic cycle, such as the Chronoboon Displacer to save your world buffs and the improved PvP Honor Ranking system. The PvP and Normal PvE realms will also progress into Burning Crusade Classic! It's never too late to go back and re-experience World of Warcraft anew—just in time to celebrate 20 years of adventures in Azeroth! The first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga kicked off in August with the launch of The War Within, bringing with it myriad new experiences with a new raid, dungeons, delves, PvP, new appearances and rewards, pets, mounts and much more. On the horizon, our next content update, Siren Isle, is currently available on the Public Test Realms (PTR), and the update will go live next month with a little something for everyone. This update also includes the epilogue questline for Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. No spoilers, but the storyline will feature the mysterious haranir, who also starred in the expansion release cinematic. The Siren Isle introduces a new outdoor environment to explore, full of mysteries to uncover and rewards to help catch your alternate characters up and prepare for the next War Within season ahead. Plunderstorm is returning with a new Plunderstore to provide more flexibility for earning rewards instead of a linear Renown track. There are also some quality-of-life changes to spell interactions, the UI and more ahead. The Siren Isle content update also brings with it Turbulent Timeways once more and additional updates to the Feast of Winter Veil in-game holiday event. We’re introducing a new novella that explores more of the story behind the scenes. Find out what happened with Jaina and Thrall after the Fall of Dalaran as they seek out reinforcements in this five-chapter special— available today and as read by Chris Metzen! Listen and read here. Xal’atath’s trail leads adventurers to a location in our next major content update that has long been known about but, as yet, remained unexplored—the Undermine. Players will travel deep into the goblin city of Undermine, the capital of the goblin’s trade empire! It is a city like none other seen before in World of Warcraft and stands as a testament to goblin intelligence and creativity as experts in both technology and alchemy. As our adventures continue, we’ll learn more about goblin culture and society that we have never been able to see before. We’ll learn what’s important to them, the problems they are trying to solve —everything that makes them truly unique, and what they’re capable of as a society. We’ll dig a bit deeper beyond just their humor and explosions, though there will still be explosions and a LOT of mayhem to be found. You’ll arrive in an Undermine that’s in conflict between the four major goblin cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company. Each cartel is run by notorious goblins like Monte Gazlowe, Renzik “The Shiv,” Baron Revilgaz, Marin Noggenfogger, and more. Which one you align yourself with is up to you. You’ll want to make sure you have a sweet ride to roll around town in— players can earn a customizable vehicle early on that’s designed just for use in Undermine. You’ll push the boundaries of locomotion on the roads of Undermine and speed through its causeways and byways at a higher rate than a ground mount can. Players can adjust the car’s driving characteristics by adding a little extra grip to hug the roads or adjust to slide and glide as they drift around corners. Want to accelerate faster? Then, you may have to sacrifice a little speed. How you customize your car’s characteristics is up to you. The new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, builds on the narrative of Undermine as players race to stop a group of goblins from blowing a dam that will bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This new dungeon will be available immediately as a part of the new The War Within Season 2 dungeon pool on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+, alongside the four other launch dungeons and three legacy dungeons. We’ll share more information on the full slate of dungeons at a later point, but we would be remiss if we didn’t include MOTHERLODE from Battle for Azeroth in the rotation. Players will also experience two new Delves and variations of existing Delves in the content update. Seasonal updates are also being introduced to Brann Bronzebeard, a new adversary to follow, Zek’vir, and a new set of goblin-inspired Curios. Experience a new 8-boss raid dungeon that takes you through the city streets and into the magnificent Gallagio— brimming with color and extravagance, it houses the dark secrets of its owner— Gallywix. There’s more at play here than it first seems, and goblin politics are treacherous and fraught with the underpinnings of something more where Xal’atath is concerned. There’s even more ahead in 2025, and we have the roadmaps to help guide you on what you can look forward to in World of Warcraft and WoW Classic. Thank you for making Azeroth your home over these last two decades. Speaking of home, the World of Warcraft team has one last thing to share with you… And yes, in World of Warcraft: Midnight, your next adventure begins at home. A house to call your very own. Stay tuned! Wherever your gaming experience takes you, we can’t wait to continue on this journey with you all. Lok’tar ogar! We’ll see you at the Inn, in Azeroth, and wherever the road takes us all next!

Leading to the 34.4 Mini-Set: an epic showdown against Murozond at the end of time! It’s been one year since Warcraft Rumble went live. To celebrate, players can log in to Warcraft Rumble today and join the one-year anniversary celebration in game. Players can collect daily rewards, including new avatars and cosmetics! The Warcraft universe is built on rich and diverse characters that may not fit into any singular family, and because of this, we’re introducing split Leaders! In Season 10, we reintroduce Sylvanas Windrunner as the first playable split Leader, honoring her allegiance to both the Horde and Undead families. Later, we will introduce Malfurion Stormrage as Alliance and Cenarion, Orgrim Doomhammer as Horde and Blackrock, and last but not least, Anub’arak as Undead and Beast. Warcraft Rumble is coming to PC! The PC beta will launch on December 10, 2024; stay tuned for more information! World of Warcraft celebrates 20 years of adventure in Azeroth, bringing together players of all ages and abilities from all over the world, making connections both in the game and out. Inspired by the incredible story captured in “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin” documentary about Mats “Ibelin” Steen—now live on Netflix— a Norwegian WoW® player who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, you can add the Reven Pack to your collection and support CureDuchenne, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and extending the lives of those affected by this disease. Live now in modern World of Warcraft, players can join the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration to collect updated Tier 2 armor appearance sets, undertake Classic Timewalking, engage with others to defeat iconic world bosses, head to the Trading post, and earn iconic new rewards, and more. The War Within has taken the leap into the first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga and adventures continue in WoW Classic, but this is only the beginning of what we have planned. Currently, in Season of Discovery, players are exploring new adventures with new class abilities, all-new level-up raids, finding secrets, and teaming up to defeat Ragnaros and Nefarian. It won’t be long until everyone can join the War Effort and open the gates to Ahn’Qiraj, where they’ll get to plunder the depths for new rewards and face new challenges. After Ahn’Qiraj, players in Season of Discovery can look forward to one more phase, in which they’ll face the dangers of Naxxramas, along with new instanced content featuring the Scarlet Crusade as well as adventures in Deadwind Pass! In Cataclysm Classic, Ragnaros has risen in the Firelands once more, and players are working toward adding the Dragonwrath Staff to their collection. In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year. And that’s not all we have in store for Classic World of Warcraft. We’re pleased to announce that Mists of Pandaria Classic will be arriving in the summer of 2025, taking players back to the shores of Pandaria and bringing its legendary class design, incredible raids and dungeons, stunning environments, and (of course) an unforgettable soundtrack. Relive the World of Warcraft Classic experience with all-new fresh realms in the WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition arriving November 21. Join players on a whole new journey to level 60, with the first raid dungeon, Molten Core, becoming available a few weeks after launch. Choose to play on a PvP realm, a Normal PvE realm, or (for the very first time) a Hardcore realm progressing through content with the other realms — all from the beginning, with fresh economies, on very large realms. These realms will launch with some of the quality-of-life features that came later in the WoW Classic cycle, such as the Chronoboon Displacer to save your world buffs and the improved PvP Honor Ranking system. The PvP and Normal PvE realms will also progress into Burning Crusade Classic! It's never too late to go back and re-experience World of Warcraft anew—just in time to celebrate 20 years of adventures in Azeroth! The first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga kicked off in August with the launch of The War Within, bringing with it myriad new experiences with a new raid, dungeons, delves, PvP, new appearances and rewards, pets, mounts and much more. On the horizon, our next content update, Siren Isle, is currently available on the Public Test Realms (PTR), and the update will go live next month with a little something for everyone. This update also includes the epilogue questline for Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. No spoilers, but the storyline will feature the mysterious haranir, who also starred in the expansion release cinematic. The Siren Isle introduces a new outdoor environment to explore, full of mysteries to uncover and rewards to help catch your alternate characters up and prepare for the next War Within season ahead. Plunderstorm is returning with a new Plunderstore to provide more flexibility for earning rewards instead of a linear Renown track. There are also some quality-of-life changes to spell interactions, the UI and more ahead. The Siren Isle content update also brings with it Turbulent Timeways once more and additional updates to the Feast of Winter Veil in-game holiday event. We’re introducing a new novella that explores more of the story behind the scenes. Find out what happened with Jaina and Thrall after the Fall of Dalaran as they seek out reinforcements in this five-chapter special— available today and as read by Chris Metzen! Listen and read here. Xal’atath’s trail leads adventurers to a location in our next major content update that has long been known about but, as yet, remained unexplored—the Undermine. Players will travel deep into the goblin city of Undermine, the capital of the goblin’s trade empire! It is a city like none other seen before in World of Warcraft and stands as a testament to goblin intelligence and creativity as experts in both technology and alchemy. As our adventures continue, we’ll learn more about goblin culture and society that we have never been able to see before. We’ll learn what’s important to them, the problems they are trying to solve —everything that makes them truly unique, and what they’re capable of as a society. We’ll dig a bit deeper beyond just their humor and explosions, though there will still be explosions and a LOT of mayhem to be found. You’ll arrive in an Undermine that’s in conflict between the four major goblin cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company. Each cartel is run by notorious goblins like Monte Gazlowe, Renzik “The Shiv,” Baron Revilgaz, Marin Noggenfogger, and more. Which one you align yourself with is up to you. You’ll want to make sure you have a sweet ride to roll around town in— players can earn a customizable vehicle early on that’s designed just for use in Undermine. You’ll push the boundaries of locomotion on the roads of Undermine and speed through its causeways and byways at a higher rate than a ground mount can. Players can adjust the car’s driving characteristics by adding a little extra grip to hug the roads or adjust to slide and glide as they drift around corners. Want to accelerate faster? Then, you may have to sacrifice a little speed. How you customize your car’s characteristics is up to you. The new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, builds on the narrative of Undermine as players race to stop a group of goblins from blowing a dam that will bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This new dungeon will be available immediately as a part of the new The War Within Season 2 dungeon pool on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+, alongside the four other launch dungeons and three legacy dungeons. We’ll share more information on the full slate of dungeons at a later point, but we would be remiss if we didn’t include MOTHERLODE from Battle for Azeroth in the rotation. Players will also experience two new Delves and variations of existing Delves in the content update. Seasonal updates are also being introduced to Brann Bronzebeard, a new adversary to follow, Zek’vir, and a new set of goblin-inspired Curios. Experience a new 8-boss raid dungeon that takes you through the city streets and into the magnificent Gallagio— brimming with color and extravagance, it houses the dark secrets of its owner— Gallywix. There’s more at play here than it first seems, and goblin politics are treacherous and fraught with the underpinnings of something more where Xal’atath is concerned. There’s even more ahead in 2025, and we have the roadmaps to help guide you on what you can look forward to in World of Warcraft and WoW Classic. Thank you for making Azeroth your home over these last two decades. Speaking of home, the World of Warcraft team has one last thing to share with you… And yes, in World of Warcraft: Midnight, your next adventure begins at home. A house to call your very own. Stay tuned! Wherever your gaming experience takes you, we can’t wait to continue on this journey with you all. Lok’tar ogar! We’ll see you at the Inn, in Azeroth, and wherever the road takes us all next!

The investment manager said Wednesday that its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) is now available to investors on the Aptos; Arbitrum; Avalanche; OP Mainnet, formerly known as Optimism; and Polygon blockchains. It initially launched the fund on Ethereum in March. The BUIDL fund, which BlackRock debuted two months after iShares Bitcoin Trust, its popular bitcoin exchange-traded fund, gives investors an opportunity to earn U.S. dollar yields through a blockchain-based vehicle. The idea of tokenizing "real world assets" such as gold, a key aspect of decentralized finance, or DeFi, has gained popularity among financial institutions that are cautious on crypto assets but keen on the underlying blockchain technology. "There's some irony in the fact that with … [iShares Bitcoin Trust], we took a crypto native investment exposure and we put it in a traditional finance wrapper … and with tokenization, we're taking traditional finance investment exposure, and we're putting it in a crypto native wrapper," Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock's head of digital assets, said in March. "That dichotomy will persist for a while," he added at the time. "But eventually, we expect there will be some convergence that looks like the best of the old system and the best of this new technology fused into a next generation infrastructure set in finance." The BUIDL fund is tokenized by Securitize, a company BlackRock has invested in that specializes in the tokenization of real-world assets. The announcement follows a weeklong rally in cryptocurrencies after Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election. Polygon's token climbed 28%, according to Coin Metrics. On the campaign trail, Trump promised more supportive regulations for crypto projects and businesses, a reversal from Biden administration policy, in which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has largely regulated the industry through enforcement actions, hampering growth. DeFi is one of the most popular sectors among crypto market participants but has suffered from the lack of regulatory clarity, with tokens of some DeFi projects being classified as securities in SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase last year.

Title: Supreme Court seems likely to allow class action to proceed against tech company Nvidia

The Supreme Court seems likely to keep alive a class-action lawsuit accusing Nvidia of misleading investors about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed likely to keep alive a class-action lawsuit accusing Nvidia of misleading investors about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency. The justices heard arguments in the tech company's appeal of a lower-court ruling allowing a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm to continue. It’s one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. Last week, the justices wrestled with whether to shut down a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit against Facebook parent Meta stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm. On Wednesday, a majority of the court that included liberal and conservative justices appeared to reject the arguments advanced by Neal Katyal, the lawyer for Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia. “It’s less and less clear why we took this case and why you should win it,” Justice Elena Kagan said. The lawsuit followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia's revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company's stock price. In 2022, Nvidia paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. That chipmaking dominance has cemented Nvidia’s place as the poster child of the artificial intelligence boom -- what CEO Jensen Huang has dubbed “the next industrial revolution.” Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia’s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia is among the most valuable companies in the S&P 500, worth over $3 trillion. The company is set to report its third quarter earnings next week. In the Supreme Court case, the company is arguing that the investors' lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration is backing the investors. A decision is expected by early summer. ___ Associated Press writer Sarah Parvini in Los Angeles contributed to this report 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Nearly two years later, the DualSense Edge refuses to drop by more than $10 for Black Friday
URL: https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/gaming-controllers/nearly-two-years-later-the-dualsense-edge-refuses-to-drop-by-more-than-usd10-for-black-friday/

Full Content:
$10 isn't a lot, but maybe it'll help you afford this premium gamepad When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Since it launched in January of 2023, I've been watching the price of the DualSense Edge like a hawk. I love that controller for loads of reasons, but there's no getting around the fact that it's simply too expensive compared to the other PS5 Pro controllers out there. Suffice it to say, I've been left disappointed every month as the Edge has held onto its $199 price tag like its life depends on it. The only ever discount I've seen has come during Days of Play, and perhaps a few sporadic deals throughout the last year, when it's dropped by a measly $10. But Black Friday approacheth, and with PS5 Pros now in the wild, that price has returned to greet us. In an early Walmart deal that might point to what we'll see at other retailers in the coming weeks, the DualSense Edge has sarcastically slumped down to $189. I know, I know, it's hardly a discount worthy of two years on the market, but it's something. For reference, this only makes it $120 more than the stock PS5 controller, as opposed to its usual $130 discrepancy. On the other hand, if you're not so fussed about Sony's homegrown pro controller, there are other Black Friday PS5 deals with much more honest discounts. The Nacon Revolution 5 pro, which shares the Edge's $199 MSRP has slid down to $149.99 at Amazon. That may be more appealing since it actually has more pro utility than the DualSense Edge. DualSense Edge | $199 $189.99 at WalmartSave $10 - A small discount makes this stubbornly expensive PS5 controller a bit more affordable. I'd love to tell you it was a bigger saving, but sometimes a smaller discount is all we can ask for if a product never leaves its MSRP. Buy it if: ✅ You want a premium version of the DualSense✅ You'd like a PS5 pro controller with haptic feedback and trigger resistance✅ You'd only use two back paddles Don't buy it if: ❌ You want more attachments and back buttons❌ You want zero chance of stick drift Price check: $199 at Amazon UK: £195 at Amazon The DualSense Edge is a great PS5 controller, but it might not be the right one for you, depending on what games you play. If you're someone who wants a gamepad that lets you compete with mouse and keyboard players, or if you want the most utility available, then you might be better off with one of the other best PS5 controllers. The Nacon Revolution 5 Pro mentioned above, as well as the Victrix Pro BFG, both have four back buttons to the DualSense Edge's two, and they're both more affordable right now. However, if you mainly play single-player games, or you only really have interest in two back paddles, the DualSense Edge will likely give you more. Sony makes it so that for other controllers to secure official licensing on PS5, they have to leave out any rumble or haptic feedback features, so the DualSense Edge is the only pro controller on PS5 that can give you that sweet haptic feedback kick. You may think that adds value to the Edge, but there is the longevity argument to talk about. The Nacon R5P has Hall Sensor sticks, making it immune to stick drift. The DualSense Edge has potentiometer sticks that will wear down over time, and even if its thumbstick modules can be removed and replaced, it's very tricky to get hold of replacements sometimes. With a reputation from the DualSense for stick drift being a common plague, that doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. If it helps, I've been using mine since launch, and it hasn't broken down in the same way as my stock PS5 controllers. More discounts are coming, check out Black Friday gaming PC deals, Black Friday Meta Quest deals, and Black Friday Secretlab deals. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.

Title: Ireland v Argentina: Robbie Henshaw takes over from Bundee Aki in only change to starting XV
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/11/13/ireland-v-argentina-robbie-henshaw-takes-over-from-bundee-aki-in-only-change-to-starting-xv/

Andy Farrell has made only one change to the Ireland starting XV for this Friday’s Autumn Nations Series encounter against Argentina at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 8.10pm) by recalling Robbie Henshaw to midfield. But there are four changes on the bench, including two prospective debutants in Thomas Clarkson and Sam Prendergast, as well as recalls for Ryan Baird and Craig Casey. Henshaw is reunited with his Leinster midfield partner Garry Ringrose in place of Bundee Aki, who misses out on the matchday squad altogether, as Farrell reverts to the combination he employed for the second Test victory over South Africa in Durban last July. The rest of the starting XV from last Friday’s 23-13 defeat by the All Blacks has been retained, with Farrell also opting for the pack which started in Kings Park when Tadhg Beirne shifted from the secondrow to blindside, save for the injured Tadhg Furlong. Not surprisingly, the latter has not been risked after aggravating a hamstring injury in Ireland’s preparatory camp in Portugal. And with Tom O’Toole obliged to undergo the 12-day return to play protocols after suffering a head injury within two minutes of his introduction against New Zealand, it means Clarkson is set to make his debut from the bench. The 24-year-old from Wicklow came through Blackrock College and was an ever-present on the Ireland Under-20 Grand Slam-winning side in 2019. Although officially named as one of the additional ‘training panellists’ when the squad was announced, he is now in line for his Test debut after winning 47 caps for Leinster. By contrast, Prendergast is only 21 yet his coronation as a Test player has been inevitable since he provided the stardust as outhalf on the 2023 Ireland Under-20 Grand Slam-winning team which also reached the Junior World Cup final. Such has been Farrell’s evident admiration for Prendergast’s repertoire of passing and kicking skills that he was called in as a training panellist for last year’s Six Nations, was brought on the tour to South Africa and started all three games on this season’s Emerging Ireland tour to the same country. His promotion comes at the expense of Ciarán Frawley, who has experienced the fickle nature of sport after his match-winning heroics in Durban, while Baird and Casey are preferred to Iain Henderson and Conor Murray. Farrell said that the selection was with “the balance of the right team to play this game” in mind, as in “achieving a performance and keeping the squad ticking over at the same time”. The head coach admitted he could have made more changes based solely on the evidence of last week, but reasoned that it was better to give players such as Jack Crowley another chance. “Jack, along with quite a few of our players, would have been hoping for better performance. Some of them are lucky enough to get another chance to do that others are coming in and some of them played pretty well themselves, but there were too many people not right at their best last week and we’re hoping for everyone to improve, not just Jack. “Obviously, the control of the game is something that Jack would be open and honest about of wanting to step up a little bit this weekend but we’ve certainly seen that in training this week.” As for his new understudy, Farrell said of Prendergast: “He’s ready. For a young fellah that’s not had much game-time provincially, he’s obviously had more of late, but in an ironic way he’s probably been patient enough. “Because, in his own mind he’d probably thought he’s been ready for quite some time because he’s that kind of kid, a confident kid. The experience that he’s got from being around the squad, he’s comfortable in his own skin. “The reason for taking him on the Emerging tour was to make sure that he understood what it was to grab hold of his team and show that he is in charge. He showed that in abundance, we’ve seen the knock-on effect from that in the squad in the last couple of weeks. “In his own mind he’s ready. He’s a young kid that’s in a pressurised-type position obviously. He’s going to make his mistakes, but that’s the nature of anyone coming through.” Improvement was needed in every area, Farrell admitted, but he maintained that being an honest group made it easier to find solutions and he welcomed the additional pressure now on this team to perform after coming up short. “Pressure’s good. It’s what concentrates the mind, you see where your character’s at. We want to win all our games, but the opposition is always going to have a say in that. I think this is perfect because we’ve got another top, top drawer opposition coming and we want to test ourselves because we feel like we let a few people down last week. “It’s the best medicine for you actually, to get back on the horse, I’m sure there’s a bit of disappointment with a few of the lads that they don’t get to do that but they understand as well that it’s about the team, it’s about the squad but, yeah, and that’s why I said it’s the perfect game because it’s very similar insofar as the quality of the opposition and where you need to be to draw out that performance from yourselves.” IRELAND (v Argentina): Hugo Keenan (Leinster); Mack Hansen (Connacht), Garry Ringrose (Leinster), Robbie Henshaw (Leinster), James Lowe (Leinster); Jack Crowley (Munster), Jamison Gibson-Park (Leinster); Andrew Porter (Leinster), Rónan Kelleher (Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Connacht); Joe McCarthy (Leinster), James Ryan (Leinster); Tadhg Beirne (Munster); Josh van der Flier (Leinster), Caelan Doris (Leinster, capt).

In the transaction, CoreWeave's existing stakeholders are selling shares to outside investors. Bloomberg reported last month that CoreWeave was targeting a $23 billion valuation for the deal, up from $19 billion in a $1.1 billion investment round announced in May. CoreWeave is going head-to-head with large cloud infrastructure providers, such as Amazon and Google in providing Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, to companies for AI workloads. The startup got a big boost last year, when Nvidia made an investment, and another stamp of approval after Microsoft enlisted the company as a third-party cloud provider. Investors have been eager to sink money into companies that are enabling generative AI, which can create text, images and videos in response to a few words of human input. The frenzy began after Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT went viral in late 2022 and led to soaring demand for compute power. "We are a company that is one of the few companies in the world that's able to bring on this kind of infrastructure at the scale that's required to actually make a difference," CoreWeave co-founder and CEO Mike Intrator told CNBC's "Squawk Box" in July. The following month Nvidia said its H200 GPUs had become available through CoreWeave, meaning the startup was the first cloud provider to reach general availability with the graphics cards. CoreWeave has raised $14 billion, a spokesperson said. In May, the company said it had raised $7.5 billion in fresh debt. In October, it announced a $650 million credit line. Last week, bitcoin mining company Core Scientific said CoreWeave had signed up for 500 megawatts worth of data center capacity in a deal that could be worth up to $8.7 billion over 12 years. In addition to Cisco and Pure, investment firms including BlackRock, Coatue and Fidelity participated in CoreWeave's secondary sale.

Title: ‘Recipe for Ethereum to reach $10K’ – How ETFs can help ETH soar

Bankless’ co-founder believes that buy pressure on ETH from ETFs has yet to materialize. On the 12th of November, Ethereum [ETH] ETFs broke new ground, finally tipping total net flows into positive territory—for the first time since their launch. Source: SoSo Value Data from SoSo Value revealed a daily net inflow of $135.92 million, pushing cumulative inflows to $94.62 million. Trading activity also ramped up, with a total value of $582.18 million traded and total net assets climbing to $9.67 billion. Of the nine ETFs, five saw inflows. Meanwhile, only Grayscale Ethereum Trust [ETHE] recorded outflows, with the remaining funds showing no new inflows. The latest development caught the attention of industry leaders on X (formerly twitter). Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, highlighted the net positive flows mark a significant milestone for ETH ETFs given they have, “Overcome $3.2bil in outflows from ETHE.” Additionally, Geraci pointed out that 19 of the top 50 ETF launches this year are linked to Bitcoin [BTC], ETH, or MicroStrategy, with 12 among the top 18—an impressive figure out of 610 total launches. Furthermore, iShares’ Ethereum Trust [ETHA] ranked as the 6th top ETF launch of 2024 Bankless co-founder Ryan Sean Adams also commented on the development. He noted that ETHE’s dominant outflows essentially offset any upward pressure from ETFs. However, as inflows turn positive for the first time, this might signal a shift. Adams even forecasted that this shift is a “Recipe for an ETH rocket to $10k.” This latest milestone comes a day after the ETFs experienced a record-breaking day on 11th November, registering $295 million in inflows. This influx, led by industry giants like Fidelity and BlackRock, marked nearly triple the previous peak of $106.6 million recorded on launch day. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, noted on X that ETFs were, “Trending in right direction.” The analyst further anticipated a positive trend for the ETFs, stating, “Sunny days ahead, although still several country miles behind BTC ETFs.” Meanwhile, BTC ETFs also hit a record of their own. Balchunas revealed on X that Bitcoin ETFs crossed the $90 billion mark in assets under management, following a substantial $6 billion increase. This comprised $1 billion in new inflows and $5 billion in market appreciation. This surge means that Bitcoin ETFs were now 72% of the way toward surpassing gold ETFs in total assets. Source: Eric Balchunas/X In a further sign of demand, IBIT reached $1 billion in trading volume within just 25 minutes—faster than the previous day, when it went on to break an all-time record. Balchunas described the sustained interest in BTC ETFs as a “feeding frenzy” that shows no signs of slowing down.

Title: How Weird Fish ditched discounts, refreshed its image and won over younger consumers

Advertisement November 13, 2024 | 10 min read Listen to article 4 min Winning the Gold award at The Drum Awards for Media 2024 in the Performance category is Launch for Weird Fish, with a robust performance strategy that helped bolster brand reputation and drive sales. Here is the award-winning case study. Weird Fish renewed its image while attracting younger customers with a refreshed performance strategy / Weird Fish This was, of course, no easy task during a cost of living crisis, with bargain prices a top consumer priority. The challenge was compounded by crowded e-commerce market conditions in which increasing numbers of online fashion retailers are competing for consumers' limited disposable income. In particular, the brand hoped to achieve a 30% increase in the clickthrough rate on non-sales-focused ads across paid search and paid social. As part of its objective to boost brand awareness, Weird Fish also wanted to lift impressions for specific Google Search keywords by 15% year-over-year (YoY) and grow average order value for Google and Bing ads by 6%. On Meta, the brand aimed to increase average order value via ads by 15% while also boosting YoY return on ad spend on Meta by 7%. A crucial element of this campaign’s success was engaging new audiences beyond Weird Fish’s traditional demographic of sales-focused consumers aged 35 and older. So, in addition to shifting brand perceptions among the existing customer base, the agency targeted a younger 25-35-year-old demographic, new to Weird Fish, who had no discount expectations. The core of this strategy focused on driving stock movement through seasonality and industry trends rather than relying on price reductions. Achieving this shift required a concerted effort across several key areas. First, building strong agency-client relationships was essential, with regular check-ins and open communication channels enabling agile responses to consumer trends beyond mere sales data. This approach ensured a readiness to adapt strategy and budget as needed, such as when demand surged for particular product lines. Another priority was audience experimentation, leveraging advanced tools like Meta’s AI-driven Advantage+, Bloomreach for personalization, and Google’s Demand Gen to define key audiences, understand their behavior and target audiences more effectively. Optimizing shopping listings also played a crucial role, employing Weird Fish’s oft-underutilized creative assets to improve ad rankings within feeds, placing them above competitors. Finally, a creative overhaul in paid social ads further enriched the brand image, strengthening its impact across platforms. Advertisement The first step in campaign execution was implementation. Central to success was the adoption of ‘The Launch Way’, an approach to client relations in which Launch establishes itself as an extension of the Weird Fish team. Regular in-person visits to their offices built personal rapport, allowed brand immersion and led to open, honest and challenging discussions. With a solid agency-client foundation established, close consultation before each season helped the team dig deep into key products and volumes. Weird Fish gave the Launch team the freedom to make autonomous decisions to push higher-margin products at key audiences when opportunities arose. For example, Launch worked with their brand buyer to test the performance of the new ‘Kerina Maxi Dress’ in paid social ads. Our hip creative featured younger models, targeted at the new, younger audiences at a non-discounted price. The dress consistently sold out and set the scene for a continuous loop where Weird Fish’s business goals fed into – and drew insight from – our campaign approach. The next step in the execution was audience experimentation. New audience reach was crucial to breaking free from discounting. Launch harnessed the latest AI tools to effectively target audiences across search and social. Google’s Demand Gen was an emerging technology when Launch first started working with the brand. But the team adopted it early, before peak season around Black Friday and Christmas, to get ahead of competitors. Combining a strong audience strategy with creative best practice, our innovative approach impressed Google, with the company’s senior account strategist Stephen Nother stating: “This activity not only delivered a significant number of incremental conversions, but also helped drive an uplift in searches year-over-year for Weird Fish which, if continued, will have positive long-term effects across search and Performance Max activity.” Launch tested and tweaked target audiences within Performance Max to reach the right customers. The team also harnessed insights from audiences in other campaign types across Google and Meta to inform approaches to reaching both existing customers and new prospects. This innovation across Google platforms was bolstered by Bloomreach, which Weird Fish uses to track consumer activity. It gave Launch access to real-time sales and audience data, enabling it to combine a seasonal approach with a reactive one, releasing budget across both paid search and social on exceptional days to move ‘in-demand’, higher value products. On paid social, Launch mastered Meta’s Advantage+, testing it with a variety of audiences to identify those that would convert to high-value sales. For example, an audience that had never purchased or been to the website was targeted with creatives in a modern, funky style – and crucially, without discounts. To increase the clickthrough rate and add polish to the brand, Launch overhauled the brand’s Google shopping listings, swapping images from basic flat lays to more visually appealing lifestyle images. Advertisement Launch enhanced Weird Fish’s shopping feed with management software Shoptimised, testing product titles that resonated best with potential customers and listing all back-end product attributes correctly. Meanwhile, much of the brand repositioning work took place across paid social channels, where Launch and Weird Fish focused on brand image enrichment, showcasing lifestyle appeal over discount pricing. Slowly axing discounts across social ads, Launch cushioned the impact by switching to more engaging visuals, like border use on Dynamic Product Ads. In years past, video had been overlooked as a brand-building tool on social for Weird Fish. The retailer had, however, staged some beautiful video shoots, so Launch put those assets to work in brand awareness campaigns across social channels.

The goal was to drive sales of higher-value products and increase conversion rates during a challenging 2023 market slump. UK e-commerce revenue was down 3% YoY and a cost of living crisis had tempered consumer spending. The campaign met or surpassed all objectives. The brand saw a 54% lift in clickthrough rates on Google and Bing ads, nearly doubling the benchmark goal. Meanwhile, on Meta, the brand achieved a 34% lift in clickthrough rate. The brand also grew return on ad spend by 8.6% on Meta, surpassing a 7% growth objective. Between December 2023 and May 2024, impressions for the term ‘Weird Fish’ increased by 24% YoY, besting the campaign target by nearly 10%. Furthermore, by refining creative assets and distribution on paid social, the clickthrough rate more than doubled in the first month, thanks to a more tailored approach. Advantage+ campaigns targeted at those who had not previously made a purchase at Weird Fish returned a £2 higher return on ad spend than others that ran with discounts. Borders added to Dynamic Product Ads dramatically improved sales and clickthrough rates on some ads by up to 220%. Plus, brand awareness campaigns featuring video assets achieved a 15-second watch time for only £0.01. Finally, the average order value for Google and Bing ads jumped by 15% overall, beating the campaign objective by 9%. On Meta, the average order value grew 15%, meeting the objective.

Title: Are You Not Entertained

Bad shots and deep thoughts on the pickleball courts, mini golf courses, and axe-throwing pitches of the new eatertainment If you buy something from an Eater link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics policy. I learned too late that axe throwing is a serious game — in my mind it had always been a concept; a bit of lumberjack cosplay. But there I was at Smash Park in suburban Roseville, Minnesota, knee-deep in an arduous lunge, arcing a dull-edged hatchet behind my head; eyes narrowed. To my left, our assigned coach, Wolfgang, was lunging beside me, rocking back and forth in his fat-tongued hiking boots, demonstrating the art of a devastating throw. My axe hit the outer rings of the bullseye, a red-and-white screen image projected onto a sensor-calibrated plywood board. My avatar, a lion wearing a red flannel shirt, flashed onto the screen: two points. Smash Park offers far more than axe throwing: At 30,000 square feet, it’s a multiplex of duckpin bowling, party darts, shuffleboard, karaoke, cornhole, and pickleball. It’s one of the emergent brands in the “eatertainment” sector, a growing category of venues that offer both entertainment and (variably) restaurant-caliber food: Smash Park, for example, distinguishes itself from bowling alley burgers and the like with considered dishes like Frito pie, barbecue sampler platters, and Bang Bang Shrimp. Eatertainment has taken off nationally in the past few years, and in the Twin Cities, it’s having somewhat of a hyper-local boom: In the past year and a half, we’ve welcomed Smash Park; Puttery, a labyrinthine, adults-only mini-golf bar in the North Loop; and now Puttshack, a high-tech mini-golf complex freshly open in Edina, with another planned for Minneapolis. It’s a fair bet that more will follow: Eatertainment brands from Dave & Buster’s to Chicken N Pickle to Pinstripes are rapidly expanding, reshaping our eating, drinking, and entertainment landscapes as they inch toward ubiquity. Smash Park’s flagship is in Des Moines, Iowa. Its founder, Monty Lockyear, is a former marketing executive and early pickleball prospector. Pickleball, of course, is the brand’s main attraction: The evening I visited, Smash Park was hosting a reunion for former players of the Minnesota Vikings and their families, and a quartet of graying ex-football players were deftly dinking back-and-forth across the nets in the indoor gymnasium. The building has the cavernous feel of a waterpark, but is partitioned into areas for eating, drinking and playing: There’s a small bowling alley; a narrow, neon-lit arcade packed with teenagers; an all-season cornhole green abutting a plush lounge area, where couples were mingling and clutching cocktails; a vast outdoor space with yard games where a happy hour crowd gathered. Kelly Sims, vice president of marketing at Smash Park, told me that the company’s target demographic is pretty broad, though it has three main archetypes: the athlete, the “21-plus” customer, and the family. Private events like bachelorette parties and corporate team-building are a big hit, too. Eatertainment isn’t a new phenomenon: Its roots lie in the frenetic arcade ethos of Dave & Buster’s and Chuck E. Cheese; even the misty, fantastical universe of the Rainforest Cafe. But today’s eatertainment has an accelerated, self-serious feel, perhaps driven by increasing competition in the sector to up the ante — to offer an experience more flashy, more distinctly marketable than the next. Take the food: Level 99, a 40,000-square-foot puzzle room complex in Providence, Rhode Island, has a built-in “scratch kitchen” that serves, among other dishes, a brown-butter three-cheese popcorn. Simulated auto racing venue F1 Arcade offers an entire raw bar, including a $129 seafood tower. Even casual eatertainment menus have a studied feel: Puttshack, promising a “culinary journey of global flavors,” has an encyclopedic appetizer list of Lebanese hummus, poutine, Persian chicken skewers, Thai fried chicken, Korean barbecue buns, and chorizo empanadas. As far as entertainment goes, new-wave eatertainment seems to either lean into a garden-of-delights approach, like Smash Park, offering a slew of activities, or to augment classic games with technology: Puttshack, which comes from the founders of Topgolf, uses a similar “Trackaball” technology that automates scorekeeping; Hijingo in the U.K. offers “multi-sensory futuristic bingo” with light shows and live dancers. At ping pong social club Spin, customers can compete against a robot named “Spinny,” an AI opponent with an unfailing serve. An astonishing amount of money has poured into eatertainment in the past few years: Investors run the gamut from nascent venture capital firms to restaurant industry executives to behemoth investment companies like Blackrock. Even pro athletes are cashing in: Puttery received a $10 million investment from pro golfer Rory McIlroy; Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes invested in Chicken N Pickle. Like the rest of the hospitality industry, eatertainment was majorly disrupted by pandemic shutdowns, but it has ballooned in the years since: Take entrepreneur Robert Thompson, who dipped out as CEO of Punch Bowl Social shortly before the business filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020. Three years later, he secured no less than $200 million for his new pickleball venue, Camp Pickle. Then there’s the Emerging Fund, a growth capital fund backed by 30-some hospitality veterans that funds “early-stage” eatertainment and restaurant tech brands. After launching in March of 2023, it raised $52 million in its first six months. What makes eatertainment such an attractive investment? There are the stats: People are dining out less these days, and eatertainment offers two-for-one brand appeal, giving consumers (ostensibly) more bang for their buck by pairing food with entertainment. There’s growing interest in the sector, with certain brands seeing anywhere from 20 to 50 percent traffic increases in the past few years, as Restaurant Business Magazine reports. Other factors make eatertainment a particularly viable business model: Some brands, like Puttshack and Pinstripes, manage to leverage deals with landlords, who are enticed by the venues’ large footprints and high foot traffic potential; others, depending on their model, are able to lower labor costs by employing counter service or self-serve models like beer walls. And, as Restaurant Business Magazine and Restaurant Dive have reported, eatertainment brands often benefit from a relatively high profit margin on the activity portion of the venue, augmenting the revenue earned from food and drink. Puttshack, for example, charges just $14 per person for a round of mini-golf, but Susan Walmesley, the company’s chief operating and marketing officer, confirmed for me that about half the brand’s revenue comes from the game. These factors give eatertainment an edge over traditional restaurant models, helping to facilitate their expansion into new markets. But there’s more to eatertainment’s success than enviable profit margins. The prevailing narrative I found in my reporting is that consumers, having emerged from the isolation and social misery of the pandemic, are craving experience: They want to feel, to connect, to “get a little weird and playful again” after a somber few years. The project of eatertainment, then, is to create an “experience economy,” or even, as Camp Pickle CEO Robert Thompson puts it, a “joy economy.” Eatertainment venues are more than destinations for date nights and office parties; far more than the rudimentary arcades and bowling alleys of eras past: Resting on three axes of pleasure (food, drink, and play), they offer a seamless, satisfying, and bonafide human “experience.” Sims and Smash Park operations director Kristin Kroeger, for example, emphasized to me that Smash Park’s true appeal lies not just in pickleball but in the brand’s combined activities, full bar, “scratch-made kitchen,” and premise of social interaction, all of which alchemize into a single “legendary experience.” I saw what they meant — Smash Park was bumping Bruno Mars as we wandered past the bar and the cornhole green, carpeted with emerald turf; we sipped idly on boozy pink slushies and peered into the private karaoke rooms. The games seemed to me like an absurd and decadent assortment of candy; a manufactured sugar rush. When our axe-throwing time slot arrived, we were ushered to our designated lane. Hurling the axe at the target gave me a thrill at first — I hit a bullseye and screamed — but it waned to a lull as my arms tired; as my aim grew methodical and labored. Between throws, I found myself hypnotized by the flat screen TVs posted around the room, flashing through a Rolodex of event advertisements: Game of Thrones trivia; ’90s name-that-song; a glow-in-the-dark “Dink and Drink” party planned for Saturday night. A queasy feeling began to set in, an emptiness I remembered from playing The Sims as a kid — the sense that I, myself, had set foot in the game. On the outdoor pickleball court, we squinted against the hazy sunshine and batted the ball back-and-forth across the net, debating whether to order the “Big Mule,” a 192-ounce Moscow mule served in a pumpkin-sized copper mug. I realized, gazing above the edge of the pickleball fence at the flat, powdery sky, that what unsettled me about Smash Park — about the eatertainment concept as a whole — was exactly the thing it advertises: its promise of fun; of play; of joy so seamlessly orchestrated, less an “experience” than the simulation of one. If eatertainment has boomed post-pandemic, I find it less likely that we are reimmersing ourselves in the world and more likely that we are retreating further from it, escaping into realities more palatable, more entertaining, than our own. That Friday night, we sat outside and listened to the live music provided for the evening: an affable, dad-aged guy with a guitar, a quarter-zip, and a honeyed voice. We hummed along to Pure Prairie League and munched on our garlic fries. Then he played Van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl” and made a lyrical substitution: “And whatever happened / to Tuesday and so slow / going down to Smash Park with a / transistor radio.” He was being funny, and we laughed, but in my periphery I saw the sky cave a little; hardening like the edges of a snowglobe. At Smash Park, all roads lead to the same place. Additional photo illustration credits: Mini golf image by Puttshack Sign up for our newsletter. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops.

Title: Zelensky’s nuclear option: Ukraine ‘months away’ from bomb

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/13/2024 8:52:37 AM PST by marcusmaximus Ukraine could develop a rudimentary nuclear bomb within months if Donald Trump withdraws US military assistance, according to a briefing paper prepared for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. The country would quickly be able to build a basic device from plutonium with a similar technology to the “Fat Man” bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945, the report states. “Creating a simple atomic bomb, as the United States did within the framework of the Manhattan Project, would not be a difficult task 80 years later,” the document reads. With no time to build and run the large facilities required to enrich uranium, wartime Ukraine would have to rely instead on using plutonium extracted from spent fuel rods taken from Ukraine’s nuclear reactors. Ukraine still controls nine operational reactors and has significant nuclear expertise despite having given up the world’s third largest nuclear arsenal in 1996. The report says: “The weight of reactor plutonium available to Ukraine can be estimated at seven tons … A significant nuclear weapons arsenal would require much less material … the amount of material is sufficient for hundreds of warheads with a tactical yield of several kilotons.” Such a bomb would have about one tenth the power of Fat Man, the document’s authors conclude.

With no time to build and run the large facilities required to enrich uranium, wartime Ukraine would have to rely instead on using plutonium extracted from spent fuel rods taken from Ukraine’s nuclear reactors. Ukraine still controls nine operational reactors and has significant nuclear expertise despite having given up the world’s third largest nuclear arsenal in 1996. The report says: “The weight of reactor plutonium available to Ukraine can be estimated at seven tons … A significant nuclear weapons arsenal would require much less material … the amount of material is sufficient for hundreds of warheads with a tactical yield of several kilotons.” Such a bomb would have about one tenth the power of Fat Man, the document’s authors conclude.

Title: ‘If I look back to my teenage years, there’s definitely an introvert there’ – Brian O’Driscoll opens up about his childhood

Time Published: 2024-11-13T16:50:22Z
Full Content:
Ireland legend Brian O'Driscoll Brian O’Driscoll has opened up about being "anxious” and not confident” as an introverted teenager and being “on the bench” as a teen before becoming the captain of the Irish rugby team. The former Ireland star has also spoken about what it’s like being on the sidelines with his former teammate Leinster Jonny Sexton at their children’s rugby games. He has revealed he was “anxious” and “not confident” as a teenager and was more of an introvert than his peers and becoming a team captain was a “major shock” to him. "I was the quiet one, happy to never be a ringleader. And that’s why the captaincy was such a weird part to be thrust upon me because I never saw myself in that role,” he told Roasted with Mark Moriarty. “I never captained any underage teams and all of a sudden it was kind of from obscurity that I was chosen to be national captain having no experience previously. "It might have been a shock to everybody else but it was a major shock to me – I definitely didn’t feel I had the qualities or attributes needed to be a good captain and there was so much to learn when I started out. “You've got to find your own way in everything you do. It was a real work for me to understand who I was going to be as a captain, as a leader. “I didn’t make school teams at 15, I was on the bench at 17 in Blackrock. Different things happen for people at different times,” he added. The Dubliner described himself as a “skilful” and “talented” child but his “nervousness” was a challenge for him. However, the rugby star thinks his middle son is braver than him on the rugby field. "I probably would have been afraid of my own shadow as a 14 or 15-year-old. My middle child, who's a keen rugby enthusiast, he's a lot braver than me. “He must have his mother’s toughness because I was nervous about making tackles,” he said. He said that his dad Frank O’Driscoll and himself are “dissimilar in some way” and that his dad is “probably more outgoing than him”. “If I look back to my teenage years, there's definitely an introvert there,” he said. "That then came out as a result of captaincy around rugby, about being projected into the public domain and so all of a sudden, there's another part of your personality comes out or has to come out.” O’Driscoll and his friend and fellow former rugby player Johnny Sexton stand on the sidelines together as their children play in the same club of St Mary’s. Both former rugby stars like to keep quiet while watching their sons play. “I'm not my dad in that regard, my dad was so vocal, I used to be like: ‘Please, be the second loudest dad’. You can still do your thing. "I am very conscious I don’t say anything. What makes it even more challenging is that myself and Sexton’s boys are on the same team so the two of us are on the sideline together. "Neither of us say a whole lot. We just watch and see what’s going on, let them enjoy it. There’s so much: ‘Would you like your son to be a professional rugby player?’. Let them enjoy it, see where it goes,” he added.

Title: BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hits $40 billion, sets new record in 211 days

BlackRock has done it again. This time its IBIT spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has hit a record of over $41 billion in net assets in 211 days. News of the milestone comes two weeks after BlackRock reached $30 billion in net assets in 293 days at the end of October. Posting on X in October, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, said what BlackRock has achieved is an “all-time record,” adding “the old record was $JEPI which did it in 1,272 days. $GLD took 1,790 days. Unreal.” With BlackRock’s new achievement, it’s surpassed the previous record of 1,253 days held by iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, according to Balchunas. In a post on X, he said: “[BlackRock’s] now in Top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at 10mo old it is bigger than all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past TEN years.” JUGGERNAUT: $IBIT has hit the $40b asset mark (a mere two wks after hitting $30b) in a record 211 days, annihilating prev record of 1,253 days held by $IEMG. It's now in Top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at 10mo old it is bigger than all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past TEN years. pic.twitter.com/WTATlpShUq — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 13, 2024 Now, BlackRock holds more than 467,000 Bitcoin, valued at $41.8 billion, according to iShares data. The new record comes as Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $93,000 on November 13 in a continued rally that’s showing no signs of slowing. The upward trajectory is partly due to Donald Trump being re-elected as US President earlier this month. Following news of his win, Bitcoin broke the $75,000 mark. It then passed $82,000, and continued to $84,000, before pushing to $87,000 earlier this week. In September, Bernstein analysts predicted that Bitcoin would surge to between $80,000 and $90,000 if Trump won the US election. With that prediction having now passed, Bernstein analysts believe Bitcoin could reach $200,000 in 2025, urging investors to “buy everything they can.” It remains to be seen how far Bitcoin will go, but for now, it’s showing no signs of slowing down.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF joins top 1% of ETFs by size, hits $40 billion milestone in record time

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed $40 billion in assets under management just 211 days after its launch. The fund has ascended to the top 1% of all ETFs in terms of assets, outpacing all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past decade, said Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The achievement shatters the previous record of 1,253 days held by the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, a BlackRock-managed fund that tracks the investment results of an index composed of large-, mid-, and small-capitalization companies in emerging markets. At just 10 months old, IBIT has also grown larger than its Gold ETF counterpart, the iShares Gold Trust (IAU), which currently holds around $32.3 billion in assets. Since its January debut, IBIT has netted approximately $29 billion in net inflows, Farside Investors data shows. The surge in Bitcoin’s price, fueled by factors like Trump’s election victory and potential regulatory changes, has driven demand for IBIT, as well as other Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin just set a new record high of $93,000 at the time of reporting, per CoinGecko. The leading crypto asset has surpassed Saudi Aramco to become the world’s 7th largest asset, according to Companies Market Cap. The latest achievement comes just days after Bitcoin overtook silver’s position. The pace of Bitcoin ETF accumulation has accelerated following Trump’s reelection, with a massive $2.8 billion being poured into IBIT in the last four trading days. The group of US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted over $4 billion in net inflows. In a Tuesday statement, Balchunas suggested that these funds are nearing the estimated Bitcoin holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto, potentially surpassing the creator of Bitcoin by Thanksgiving. Market analysts expect continued inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, supported by the positive sentiment surrounding the crypto markets and potential future developments.

Title: Warren Buffett Breaks 6-Year Streak Of Berkshire Hathaway Stock Buybacks, Say 'It's Too Expensive'
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-breaks-6-streak-155338238.html
Time Published: 2024-11-13T15:53:38Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett recently ended a six-year streak of stock buybacks for the company. While the company regularly participates in stock buybacks, it did not do so during the third quarter, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Despite having over $325 billion in cash reserves, Buffett opted not to use that cash to buy back shares, suggesting that he believes the stock is too expensive. Don't Miss: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date. The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Buffett's approach to stock buybacks is straightforward: he only buys back shares when he considers them a "bargain." According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings, he looks for a stock price below the company's intrinsic value – a conservative measure considering the long-term worth of Berkshire's assets. Analysts believe the absence of buybacks sends a clear message to the market: Berkshire's stock is overvalued at its current price. Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares are trading around 1.6 times their book value, representing the company's assets once debts are subtracted. In the past, Berkshire has avoided buybacks when the stock traded above 1.2 times its book value, but that guideline was dropped in 2018. Trending: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Buffett's conservative investment philosophy remains firm even with a more flexible policy. Robert Korajczyk, a finance professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, explained to CNN, "He's been very clear that they would never buy back shares if they thought that the firm was overvalued." In addition to ending its buyback streak, Berkshire increased its already significant cash holdings by selling stocks in the third quarter. Some analysts took this as a cautionary move due to concerns about the current market environment. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. NYU Stern School of Business professor Aswath Damodaran told CNN that Buffett's decision to hold cash suggests Berkshire is taking a conservative stance, likely due to high stock prices. "It's a signal that they feel cautious about where the market is," Damodaran said. "They've become cautious because they think the market is richly priced." Buffett frequently emphasizes patience and caution in investing, especially in overheated markets. Known for his simple advice, Buffett has reminded investors of the importance of waiting for opportunities that align with their long-term goals. One of his well-known principles is to "be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful." This approach aligns with his decision not to pursue buybacks when Berkshire's stock is performing well but appears expensive. See Also: With over 7.8K investors including Meta, Google, And Amazon Execs — this AI Startup's valuation has skyrocketed from $5 million to $85 million in just three years. Be an early investor with just $1,000 for only $0.50/share today before the offer closes in 2 weeks. For investors following Buffett's lead, his recent actions underline the importance of valuation and the benefit of holding cash when the market feels overvalued. Buffett's strategies, which often prioritize value and conservative growth, can provide insights for those looking to make calculated, patient investments that align with their financial goals. Consider talking to a trusted financial advisor if you're looking for guidance tailored to your unique circumstances. They can help you map out a plan toward your long-term goals.

The Swedish payments company has yet to publicly file its IPO prospectus. The company said the offering would follow the SEC's review process and is subject to market conditions. Analysts recently valued Klarna, which was founded in 2005, in the $15 billion range. At its peak during the pandemic-led surge in fintech stocks and e-commerce, the company had a valuation of $46 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank's Vision Fund 2. But Klarna took an 85% haircut in its most recent primary fundraising round, in 2022, when the company raised money on a valuation of $6.7 billion. In addition to SoftBank, Klarna's roster of shareholders includes Sequoia Capital and London-based firm Atomico. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski previously told CNBC in an interview that unfavorable rules in Europe on employee stock options could risk the company losing talent to U.S. tech giants such as Google, Apple and Meta. Plans for an IPO have been in the works for some time. In a February interview with CNBC's "Closing Bell," Siemiatkowski said an IPO in 2024 was "not impossible." Affirm, one of the company's key competitors, went public in 2021 and is now valued at about $18 billion. In August, Klarna said it swung to a profit in the first half of the year. Klarna's decision to go pursue a listing in the U.S. represents a major blow to European stock exchanges, which have been trying to encourage local tech companies to list at home. The London Stock Exchange, for example, has made reforms to make the U.K. a more attractive market for tech companies to list, including the ability for founders to issue dual-class shares that enable entrepreneurs to maintain control over a company's strategy and direction. Siemiatkowski hadn't previously committed to listing in one market over another, and London was among the markets he was considering for Klarna's IPO. However, in 2021 he said that the firm was more likely to list in the U.S. than the U.K., due in part to higher visibility. Navina Rajan, an analyst at PitchBook, said it's an ongoing trend. "We've seen the share of European companies listing on European exchanges has continued to decline from the 10-year low since last year and the valuation gap between both geographies for tech companies remains," Rajan told CNBC in an email. "European IPO markets have seen some recovery as of Q3 this year," she added. Listing in the U.S. lines up with Klarna's focus on U.S. expansion, Rajan said.

Title: BlackRock Expands Tokenized Fund BUIDL Beyond Ethereum to 5 New Blockchains

Election 2024 coverage presented by BlackRock, the world's largest asset-management company, said it is bringing its tokenized real-world asset fund to five more blockchains, taking it beyond Ethereum and expanding access to the largest money-market fund token. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), issued in partnership with tokenization platform Securitize, is now accessible on the Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism's OP Mainnet and Polygon networks, the company said on Wednesday. Tokenization of real-world assets is one of the hottest trends at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance. Digital asset firms and global financial heavyweights are racing to put instruments such as government bonds, private credit and funds on blockchain rails, aiming to achieve faster settlements and operational efficiencies. "We wanted to develop an ecosystem that was thoughtfully designed to be digital and take advantage of the advantages of tokenization," Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo said in a statement. "With these new chains we'll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do." Read more: McKinsey Sees Just $2T of Tokenized RWAs by 2030 in Base Case, With Broad Adoption 'Still Far Away' BlackRock introduced its first tokenized product in March. The BUIDL token is backed by short-term U.S. government bonds and its price is anchored to $1. Institutions and protocol treasuries use the product to park their on-chain cash to earn a yield or as collateral for trading, while other decentralized finance protocols such as Ondo Finance build their products on top of it. BUIDL has raked in over $520 million of deposits, becoming the largest product in the $2.3 billion tokenized U.S. Treasury market, rwa.xyz data shows. BUIDL's management fee on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism is 50 basis points. It is cheaper — only 20 basis points — on Aptos, Avalanche and Polygon. Ecosystem development organizations Aptos Foundation, Avalanche (BVI), Inc. and Polygon Labs BD Investments (Cayman) Ltd. each agreed to pay BlackRock a quarterly fee. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Nvidia’s (NVDA-4.19%) new artificial intelligence chip has its first customer, which plans to build the most powerful AI supercomputer in Japan. The chipmaker is collaborating with Japan’s SoftBank Group to build an AI supercomputer, which will use chips from Nvidia’s new Blackwell platform, the companies announced on Wednesday at Nvidia’s AI Summit Japan. SoftBank will be the first to receive Nvidia’s DGX B200 systems to build the Nvidia DGX SuperPOD supercomputer. The supercomputer will feature Nvidia software and networking and will be used for SoftBank’s generative AI development. “With your support, we are creating the largest AI data center here in Japan,” SoftBank Group chief executive Masayoshi Son said. “We should provide this platform to many of those researchers, the students, the startups, ... so that they have a better access [to] much more compute.” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the supercomputer is only part of the collaboration between the chipmaker and the investment management company. SoftBank is also planning to build another supercomputer with Nvidia “to run extremely compute-intensive workloads.” The next supercomputer is based on Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell platform. “Japan has a long history of pioneering technological innovations with global impact,” Huang said, adding that with SoftBank’s investment in Nvidia’s technology, “Japan is leaping into the AI industrial revolution to become a global leader, driving a new era of growth across the telecommunications, transportation, robotics and healthcare industries in ways that will greatly benefit humankind in the age of AI.” Nvidia’s shares were up around 0.2% after the market opened on Wednesday morning, while SoftBank’s Japan-listed shares were down almost 2.9%.

Title: Bitcoin's wild election year ride in 3 charts

Time Published: 2024-11-13T14:35:00Z

Bitcoin has been on a tear since Donald Trump’s election win, and it could be poised for even more gains. The leading cryptocurrency hit $93,000 on Wednesday, with an $100,000 milestone getting closer and closer. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to turn the country into the “crypto capital of the planet,” and Bitcoin, the world’s largest and oldest cryptocurrency, neared a record high of $90,000 on Tuesday. Trump has already appointed two pro-crypto candidates, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE (also a ticker symbol for Dogecoin, a meme token promoted by Musk). Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been soaring after last week’s election outcome, which has sparked investor confidence in digital assets. Over the past four years, Bitcoin has been extremely volatile, as shown by the 2022 collapse of the crypto giant FTX. The price fluctuates around economic events, regulatory actions, and market sentiment, which is why Trump’s appointments will be critical. We looked at Bitcoin’s volatility in 2024 and compared that with other assets and peers. A large volume of outflow occurred this year after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs on Jan. 10, 2024. The market rebalanced itself as other assets (such as Ethereum, Tether, and Dogecoin) gained popularity among investors. Bitcoin’s price quickly ticked up after fund approvals in late February and early March. During the first week of March, Bitcoin’s price continued to set records, crossing $73,000 at one point. On April 19, 2024, Bitcoin had its fourth and latest halving event, which reduced the reward for a mined block. Bitcoins are created by mining software and hardware at a specified rate, which splits in half every four years, slowing the number of coins created. On Sept. 18, 2024, after the Federal Reserve announced its first rate cut since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin showed a sharp surge on the following day, rising to $63,000 from the $60,000 it was two days prior. The leading cryptocurrency saw another all-time high (of $76,943) after Trump was reelected before it closed at $75,904 (a 9% increase from $69,360) on Nov. 5, 2024. According to recent data from Coin Market Cap, in 2024, the global value of cryptocurrency rose to $2.87 trillion from roughly $1 billion in 2013. Bitcoin’s value surpasses the combined market caps of Ethereum, Tether, Solana, and BNB — bitcoin’s 60% dominance in the crypto market demonstrates higher investor confidence compared with its peers. On Tuesday, Bitcoin’s market cap briefly reached $1.78 trillion, making it the eighth-largest asset by market cap (surpassing silver), according to data retrieved from Companies Market Cap, a website providing data on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin trails gold, Nvidia (NVDA-4.19%), Apple (AAPL-1.61%), Microsoft (MSFT-2.82%), Google (GOOGL-2.45%), Amazon (AMZN-5.22%), and Saudi Aramco in global asset rankings. But despite already impressive year-to-date growth, Bitcoin would need to be 10 times its current level to match gold’s market cap.

Title: Saudi Arabia's futuristic city just faced another setback, but the country still has its eyes on being an AI leader

Hello there! Already thinking about holiday shopping? Maybe this Apple coffee-table book could be good for the music lover in your life. Be warned: It's not cheap, and there won't be a ton of them made. In today's big story, Saudi Arabia's futuristic city, which is part of its big modernization plans, just got another reality check. What's on deck: If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Saudi Arabia's dreams of the future are facing the realities of the present. The CEO of the Kingdom's futuristic city, Neom, abruptly stepped down after six years in the role. It's another setback for the country's ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify its economy away from relying on oil and make it an attractive tourist destination. Neom is arguably the most high-profile portion of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plan. Even if you haven't been closely following the project, you've likely seen mockups of the twin mirrored skyscrapers dubbed "The Line" that look like a massive wall running through the desert. But Neom is having an "Instagram vs. reality" moment … literally. Influencers and vloggers who posted videos of their lives in the yet-to-be-completed city were mostly mocked in what one viewer described as having "low security prison vibes." Grand plans also don't come cheap. Estimates for Neom have swelled to as much as $1.5 trillion. Saudi has already invested $1.3 trillion in the wider Vision 2030 project. Foreign investments in the plan haven't panned out the way Saudi hoped either, leading the Kingdom to look to China for help with the bill. The move is part of the deepening financial ties between the two countries, which poses a potential threat to the US. Saudi Arabia's big plans also include tech's biggest prize: AI. The Kingdom has spent years investing billions in the tech, including the recent creation of a $40 billion fund dedicated to AI investments. But it's also looking to develop the tech in its home country, writes BI's Hasan Chowdhury. Saudi Arabia's approach to AI isn't unlike the role it plays as an energy giant: Provide the fuel others rely on to make their projects go. "Project Transcendence" includes building all-important data centers in the country and serving as the Middle East AI hub for tech giants. AWS has already committed more than $5 billion to building data centers in the country. It's not alone, though. The United Arab Emirates is aiming to be the AI leader in the region by 2031.

TWO PEOPLE HAVE been arrested in south Dublin as part of an investigation into a large scale money laundering operation. Yesterday, gardaí, assisted by members from the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, as well as colleagues from Europol, executed a search warrant at an address in Blackrock. The investigation relates to a large-scale operation of alleged money laundering and follows a number of international complaints into various forms of alleged online fraud. An investigation team was established in the DMR East garda district as a result and suspicious activity was identified in a number of bank accounts. This included money transactions from hundreds of bank accounts from over 15 countries across Europe, suspected to be the proceeds of crime and ‘money mule’ transactions. A ‘money mule’ is a person who allows their bank account to be used for the transfer of another person’s stolen or illegal money.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA, Financial) set to release its Q3 numbers on November 20, is in the spotlight again, as analysts anticipate an earnings beat driven by its market-leading, AI-focused data center chips. Recently, Mizuho analysts raised their price target for Nvidia from $140 to $165, expressing optimism about the company's stronghold in the AI and data center segments. Analysts believe this position will secure demand for Nvidia's GPUs despite ongoing supply chain pressures. Currently, Nvidia commands over 95% of the AI accelerator market, leveraging this strategic advantage by supplying GPUs specifically tailored for AI applications. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. Earnings per share (EPS) remain positively aligned with revenue expectations, as analysts project Nvidia's annual revenue growth to reach about $33.07 billion this quarter, marking an 82% increase year-over-year. Products such as the H100 and the upcoming Blackwell series have proven essential for data-intensive industries like cloud computing and generative AI, supporting Nvidia's nearly threefold stock price surge in 2024, which has elevated the company's valuation to almost $1.5 trillion. While Nvidia has established a significant presence in the Chinese market, recent U.S. export restrictions pose challenges. However, the company remains a prominent player in the AI hardware space, and its forthcoming earnings report is expected to reaffirm Nvidia's promising position within an AI-centric economy.

Title: Amazon is shuttering Freevee and some insiders fear layoffs could be coming in the tech giant's entertainment arm

Amazon is phasing out its free-to-watch streaming service Freevee as insiders speculate about potential layoffs in the tech giant's entertainment arm. Amazon said Freevee's shows, including new episodes and library originals of shows like "Bosch," "Jury Duty," and "Judy Justice," would be available for free to non-Prime members on Prime Video. A sampling of other popular library originals also will be available for free, including the first season of "The Summer I Turned Pretty" and the first three seasons of "The Boys," which could help entice non-Prime members to eventually subscribe to the paid version. The Freevee phaseout is expected to take place over the coming weeks. "To deliver a simpler viewing experience for customers, we have decided to phase out Freevee branding," an Amazon rep said in a statement. "There will be no change to the content available for Prime members, and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members, including select Originals from Amazon MGM Studios, a variety of licensed movies and series, and a broad library of FAST Channels — all available on Prime Video." The phaseout comes as three Amazon insiders told BI they believe MGM Studios could soon be hit by layoffs as the company looks to cut costs. Amazon said no Freevee employees were laid off as part of the phaseout as they were absorbed into other entertainment teams but didn't comment on the potential for broader layoffs. Speculation has centered on former Freevee employees as well as MGM Studios' development and unscripted teams. Amazon already cut hundreds of jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios teams earlier this year. Amazon spent $18.9 billion on video and music in 2023, up 14% from 2022 (though that increase is lower than the 28% jump it had the previous year). Before this latest move to shutter Freevee, Amazon had quietly been winding down the service for months, even as the company publicly denied it would completely shut down. It stopped greenlighting new Freevee originals and had been moving some Freevee employees to other parts of MGM Studios. Lauren Anderson, who headed up content for Freevee, moved in May into a role helping sell sponsorships and developing brand-supported originals for Prime Video. Freevee began in 2019 as IMDb TV and rebranded in 2022 as it ramped up original content production. It was part of a trend of free streaming TV services along with Fox-owned Tubi and Paramount's PlutoTV. The service had struggled to carve out an identity for itself and lost money, people familiar with the business previously told BI. It produced few hits except for James Marsden-starring "Jury Duty," which was nominated for two Emmys. It also competed for resources with Prime Video and created brand confusion with some viewers. When Amazon launched ads across Prime Video in January, throwing a splashy upfront event to pitch them, it created further questions about ad-supported Freevee's future as a stand-alone service.

Brands in ecommerce have the wonderful advantage of having access to a broader number of consumers than their local counterparts. Before you can woo a broader base of consumers, it is important to recognize the diversity that exists among them, and the intention required to convert them. I’m an inclusive marketing strategist and run an inclusive marketing consultancy. Last year I did audits of multiple ecommerce websites, and found the same opportunities for improvement over and over again from the perspective of how brands can do a better job of converting more of their ideal consumers who are part of underrepresented and underserved communities. Consumers, no matter their identity, are looking for an answer to this fundamental question: is this brand for people like me? There are three core areas that signal to a consumer whether or not a brand is for them or not. And as a result of those signals, the consumer will make a decision whether or not to take the next step forward with you, or not. Download this ecommerce kit for free marketing, sales planning, and abandoned cart email templates. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. The people you want to serve need to see themselves, or who they aspire to be, reflected in the visual imagery your brand puts forth. When they see themselves represented in the models you use, in your customer testimonials, or even imagery of your team, they receive a signal from you that communicates “people like me belong here.” When they don’t see themselves represented, the signal they receive is, “This brand isn’t for you.” Delivering experiences that have as little friction as possible for the people you serve, especially those with identities that are part of underrepresented and underserved communities, will demonstrate to them that you’ve taken the time to consider them to ensure they feel like they belong with you. One of the most effective ways to eliminate friction in your customer experience, is to design your ecommerce user experience with specific identities in mind. By considering the various types of identities your ideal customers hold in the design and development process, it makes it easier for you to incorporate elements that make people with those identities feel seen, supported, and like they belong with you. If you need additional resources to help you with your ecommerce strategy, check out this Ecommerce Planning Kit from HubSpot. Here are eight examples of ecommerce websites that have done a good job of designing for the needs of consumers with specific underrepresented and underserved identities. Smart marketers know that people who have the problem their brands solve don’t just live in one country or speak one language. As such, it is helpful to showcase to these consumers immediately when they land on your website that your brand is for them. Business card print house Moo does it by placing an option in the main navigation of its website that enables site visitors to select which country they are in, and the associated language they need. Based on the selection, the website automatically changes to the country’s corresponding language. Image Source Retailer Farm Rio takes a similar approach. Consumers are able to select which country they live in from the main navigation. Once confirmed, pricing and shipping options for the clothing items change to reflect the local currency of where the consumer is shopping from. In this image, the country selected is Morocco, and prices are shown in their currency, the Dirham. Image Source Having to do a price conversion adds unnecessary friction, and sends a strong signal that “This brand isn’t for me.” This episode of the Inclusion & Marketing podcast details how to build an effective multilingual content strategy so you can attract more people who speak other languages to your website. 00:00/00:00 Just because someone has a disability, that doesn’t mean that they don’t enjoy wearing stylish clothes. 15% of the world’s population has some form of disability. As such, making your website accessible enables you to support the needs of a broader group of people, while delivering an experience with less friction. Fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana has embraced accessibility, by making it so website visitors can adjust accessibility settings to suit their needs. Image Source Estimates show that between 15-20% of the population is neurodivergent, including people with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and sensory processing disorder. Amazon is a brand that is making an intentional effort to serve these consumers. In this video, three neurodiversity consultants, who are also consumers, share the ways in which Amazon delivers an experience that supports their needs. You can catch the full discussion on how brands can design experiences that work for neurodivergent consumers on this episode of the Inclusion & Marketing podcast. 00:00/00:00 Smart brands demonstrate to the LGBTQ+ community that they are seen, supported, and belong all year long, rather than just with PRIDE month limited edition products and rainbows. Retailer Calvin Klein does it by showcasing a broad diversity of masculinity in the models it features on its website. Here’s how one gay male consumer explained why that range of representation is important to him. Another way ecommerce brands can show support to the LGBTQ+ community is in how products are classified. Fenty Beauty made its skincare line gender neutral, so there was no need to label products being for “men” or “women” which can exclude people who are non-binary. The brand even goes as far to showcase gender diversity in the models using the products. Image Source And underwear brand Bonds has done it by offering a gender-free line of its clothes. Image Source You can find more tips on how to build an LGBTQ+ inclusive brand on this episode of the Inclusion & Marketing podcast. 00:00/00:00 Many restaurants now have an ecommerce arm to their business, as they start asking, and even encouraging, people to grab takeout via online ordering. As someone with dietary restrictions, I’ve always been reluctant to embrace the convenience of ordering food online, for fear of the staff not seeing my write-in requests for accommodations with my food. Cooper’s Hawk has addressed this fear. Within the online ordering section, they’ve created separate products that are labeled gluten-free. Even the name of the product has a “GF” at the end, so me or anyone else with a gluten-free restriction doesn’t have to write anything in and pray the notes were read. Image Source The brand takes a similar approach to vegan items on the vegetarian menu. A person can feel reassured that their food will in fact be vegan because it is labeled on the website as, “Vegan Sweet Corn & Tomato Risotto” Image Source The average clothing for a woman in the US and the UK is 16-18. But too often, the models showcasing clothing on ecommerce retail sites are models who wear much smaller sizes. Savage X Fenty takes a different approach. The brand features a broad range of diversity in the models it uses, including a range of body sizes and types. Image Source And when it comes time for consumers to select their size, they don’t have to deal with being labeled “plus-sized" as other retailers often do. They just select from the broad range of sizes offered by the brand. There are many different identities your consumers have when it comes to race and ethnicity. As such, when you’re thinking about the people you feature on your website, make sure you include a range of models that reflect those races and ethnicities. Pro tip: Don’t opt for trying to use models who are racially ambiguous to try to appeal to the broadest range of consumers. It actually has the opposite effect, and frustrates people (often those of darker complexions) who often don’t see themselves represented. Retailer David’s Bridal does this on their website, by highlighting a broad diversity of races and ethnicities with their models that is reflective of the people who buy their dresses. Image Source Image Source Image Source Consumers who have the problem your brand solves will also have a diversity of religious affiliations, traditions, and celebrations. While most brands lean hard into traditional Christian holidays, such as Christmas, more brands are starting to add additional holidays to the ones they celebrate. Ikea has added products for Diwali, to see and serve consumers who celebrate it. Image Source And consumers appreciate that IKEA has products for them. There’s plenty of videos on YouTube of people showing their Diwali hauls from IKEA. There’s no downside to doing so. The more people you’re able to send clear signals that “you belong here” through your intentional design and user experience choices, the more people you’ll be able to convert.

Title: Trump Adds to List of Fake EU Crises
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2024/11/trump-adds-to-list-of-fake-eu-crises.html
Time Published: 2024-11-13T11:00:34Z
Full Content:
For the EU, fake crises like the Russia threat and Trump abandoning NATO mean more giveaways to (mostly US) weapons companies. They mean more neoliberalism through more social spending cuts and privatizations due to lack of funds and more war on the working class. Any threat posed by Trump (and the Biden administration or whoever comes after Trump) is the result of the very real crises of Europe’s overdependence on the US and energy prices hurting industry, but those are deemed necessary to deal with the fake crises. Has the reemergence of the bad orange man caused any rethink about the EU strategy to “de-risk” from Russia and China and put itself at the mercy of Washington? Or are Europeans falling over themselves with pledges to increase defense spending? It’s the latter. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, as usual, takes the cake. She managed to come up with a plan that would shoot the EU in both feet with her idea to buy even more gas from the US. This would increase dependence on the US while simultaneously doing even more to wreck the economies of EU states. Here’s Politico with the details: Stressing that the EU still buys significant amounts of energy from Russia, von der Leyen asked: “Why not replace it by American LNG, which is cheaper for us and brings down our energy prices? It’s something where we can get into a discussion, also [where] our trade deficit is concerned.” During the first Trump term, Juncker avoided more tariffs by assuring the U.S. president that Europe would facilitate more imports of liquefied natural gas (and more American soybeans.) In fact, the European Commission has no real power in determining European companies’ purchases of LNG and soybeans, but Trump was happy to accept the political theater of parading data that European purchases were going up. There is no evidence that American LNG is cheaper, as von der Leyen is quoted as saying. It’s actually a lot more expensive than the pipeline Russian gas Europe used to get. And the European Commission does have some power in determining European companies’ purchases of LNG through its sanction powers. And the Commission doesn’t have the power to dictate purchases yet. Due to recent crises, EU member states added new instruments to Ursula’s toolbox during her first five-year term, such as the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, International Procurement Instrument, an Anti-Coercion Instrument, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, and the EU Critical Raw Materials Act. Maybe the latest Trump crisis will add another tool to her toolbox. One gets the feeling that Ursula is intentionally trying to do economic damage to bloc nations in order to increase the odds she gets her coveted eurobonds. If there’s another crisis — or series of crises — she might get the chance. Countries having to throw more money at the energy crisis and shrinking GDPs could struggle to pay more for defense, which would lead to more calls for joint borrowing. Some background on the idea from Euractiv: This miracle happened during the eurozone crisis when the EU created a legal instrument, the European Financial Stability Facility, able to issue bonds and with a lending capacity of €440 billion. And with the COVID pandemic, the miracle was repeated as the EU adopted a recovery fund with a firepower of €750 billion, financed through common debt issuance. The same line of thinking has inspired politicians to imagine defence bonds – to finance a major boost of the EU’s defence capabilities, after years of neglect when it was assumed that war was a thing of the past or that Uncle Sam would always come to the EU’s defence… Speaking at the European Defence Agency annual conference on 30 November, [European Council President Charles] Michel said EU member states should pool what could amount to €600 billion in defence investment over the next 10 years… A couple of weeks later, French President Emmanuel Macron returned to the topic, telling investors at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Europe should resort to joint debt to finance its priorities, including defence. In the ensuing months the argument for joint debt has come to include remedies for other EU problems. European heads of state met in Budapest last week with a focus on competitiveness. That’s the buzzword these days. Europe isn’t competitive enough. Mario Draghi was there pushing his sham solutions from the standard neoliberal playbook. Just consider the following. If you are worried about competitiveness do you: Of course none of this was discussed in Budapest. National leaders instead opted for minor measures and slogans like “ensuring industrial renewal and decarbonization,” “increasing preparedness and defence capabilities,” and “putting Europe at the forefront of global research and innovation.” They’re all empty phrases without the money and some semblance of a strategy to back them up. The EU is, however, planning to redirect billions to defense from its social cohesion funds. How much remains to be seen, and there are tradeoffs. That money used to be earmarked to reduce economic disparities and promote development. EU capitals will now have more “flexibility” to spend the funds to support their defense industries and military projects. According to the FT, only about five percent of the 392 billion euros allocated for 2021-2027 has been spent to date. While Ursula and company didn’t get common EU debt yet, the crises are only picking up steam. And it should be noted that redirected social cohesion funds is considered one of the final emergency steps before turning to the joint EU debt. Ursula is unlikely to let it go as it’s the top goal of her second term. It was only in March of this year that the idea of joint borrowing for defense was considered “radical.” Now surrounded by fake crises and self-inflicted real ones, the idea is gaining trans-Atlantic traction. Let’s not forget that international finance is a big fan of the joint debt for defense plan. Since member states are running into budgetary constraints, investors are using the fiscal rules imposed by Brussels to push for an EU-wide bond program that would bring them big-time profits while allowing the bloc to ramp up military spending without individual nations incurring more debt. Much of Europe supports joint borrowing because in theory, there could be benefits to common debt, especially for countries like Italy which face higher borrowing costs, but going down that road to pay for the US empire ain’t it. The two staunchest opponents to joint debt are Germany and the Netherlands. Are they prepared to withstand the pressure from financial powers, the Trump administration, and much of Europe? The signs aren’t encouraging. The Dutch are currently killing Europe’s most valuable tech firm at the behest of the Americans for some pyrrhic and temporary victory against China. Germany might soon be led by a former board member of BlackRock, Friedrich Merz, which will be a nebulous plus, according to Politico: Scholz’s woes may have a silver lining for some: In Budapest, some diplomats suggested that the collapse of Germany’s ruling coalition and Merz becoming chancellor might not be a bad thing. Merz “is a former MEP so more engaged on European affairs,” said one EU diplomat who was granted anonymity to speak freely. “He’s also from the EPP, so the same family as the dominant force in [the European] Parliament, also the same family as von der Leyen, which can help at a time like this. The Logic Behind More Defense Spending As the FT notes, and all the media stories do the same, ‘Trump warned Nato allies earlier this year that as president he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” if alliance members failed to meet their defence spending target.’ Yet even if Moscow wanted to invade Europe (there’s no sign it does nor any reason it would want to) what are all these extra billions going to do that all the billions and all the West’s military hardware in Ukraine couldn’t do? So the EU argument is as follows: Trump says we must spend more, there’s nothing we can do because orange man bad and we need the US because we cut ourselves off from Russia and China. Meanwhile real economies are imploding, and more forced austerity coming — although there has been talk about a carve out in the spending limits for defense spending. It was always going to end this way due to a political class that sees themselves as faithful servants to the US empire and transnational capital and have nothing but scorn for the local peasants. They’re all groveling now before Trump. It’s easy to see why: Two percent of GDP on defense spending isn’t enough, says German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. President Duda said in his Independence Day speech that all NATO states must increase their military spending to a minimum 3%, an increase from the 2% spending target agreed on in 2014. Trump recently also said that 3% is needed for NATO. Poland will spend 4.7% next year 🇵🇱🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/CuWDaGWPNf — Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) November 12, 2024 The thing is Europe has been spending more. In many ways Europe’s bureaucracy has already changed in small but fundamental ways in order to redirect money towards the military-industrial complex. From Equal Times: “In 2023, there was a very significant increase in military spending worldwide, but especially in Europe. In Spain, for example, it grew by 24 per cent and in Finland by 36 per cent. If we compare it with 2013, the European countries in Nato are spending 30 per cent more,” says Pere Ortega, a researcher at the Barcelona-based Centre Delàs for Peace Studies, which is critical of measures adopted by the European Commission to promote military spending, such as the VAT exemption for the purchase of armaments or the change in the regulations of the European Investment Bank (EIB) to allow it to finance industrial projects in the military sphere. And according to the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), the number of countries meeting the two percent target has risen from 3 to 23 since 2014: IN Germany, much has been made about the government’s scaling back of support for Ukraine, and how the cabinet’s approved military budget only increased by 1.25 billion euros to 53.25 billion this year but as WSWS points out: …the government is actually spending far more on armaments and war. A government overview of the budget states that “taking into account the relevant shares of other individual plans,” the NATO target of military spending of at least 2 percent of gross domestic product will be achieved. With a GDP of €4.122 trillion, this means at least €82.4 billion in military spending. The sum is probably even higher, as Scholz has already boasted of defence spending of €90 billion to NATO. In addition to the central defence budget, the government has already announced “defence-related expenditure” of €14 billion from other budget areas in the current year. Further projects totalling €20 billion will be paid from the Bundeswehr “special fund,” which totals €150 billion…In 2028, when it is expected the Bundeswehr special fund will be exhausted, the defence budget is set to rise by a huge increase of almost €30 billion to around €80 billion. Where has it gotten them? In the case of Germany, not much, at least according to a September report from the Kiel Institute: … the build-up of German capacities is progressing slowly. We document Germany’s military procurement in a new Kiel Military Procurement Tracker and find that Germany did not meaningfully increase procurement in the one and a half years after February 2022, and only accelerated it in late 2023. Given Germany’s massive disarmament in the last decades and the current procurement speed, we find that for some key weapon systems, Germany will not attain 2004 levels of armament for about 100 years. When taking into account arms commitments to Ukraine, some German capacities are even falling. The Plan All Along? The funny thing about all the gnashing of teeth over Trump and the danger he poses to NATO, is Europe shouldering more of the American empire’s load in the Russian periphery has long been the stated goal. If we look at what neocons, the real movers and shakers in the plutocrats and their think tanks on both sides of the Atlantic, and European politicians say, this was the plan. Here’s a September report from the Munich Security Conference, commonly referred to as “Davos with guns”: Russia’s aggressive revisionism has underscored NATO’s primacy in European defense. However, the real possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House means that Europeans may soon have to seize a much larger share of the burden, both in supporting Ukraine and deterring Russia. A strong European Defence Union, based on the EU’s regulatory powers, ability to pool resources, and large single market, can become an important enabler of a more robust European pillar within NATO. Here is a team from the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) writing earlier this year in Foreign Affairs about how Europe must lead in the fight against Russia so the US can focus on China: That complicated reality requires U.S. allies, especially in Europe, to take on a larger share of directing the containment of Russia. Europe has shown its political and economic resilience in the face of Russian aggression. Yet militarily, the continent remains dependent on the United States. This dynamic must change, in part because the United States must commit more of its resources to Asia. The growth of European defense spending since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is an encouraging step. In 2023, 11 NATO members hit their spending target, allocating at least two percent of GDP to national defense, up from just seven members in 2022. The rest need to follow suit. Europe must also resolve the problem of coordination. Right now, the United States coordinates more than 25 militaries in Europe. While it must continue to do this in the short term, it must push individual European countries and the European Union to take over this role and to create a stronger European pillar in NATO. The Centre for European Policy Studies with more: Against this backdrop, the EU’s true ‘Hamiltonian moment’ in defence would be a decision to issue joint debt to properly fund the ambitions set out in its Defence Industrial Strategy. Based on Art. 122 TFEU and implemented in accordance with Articles 173-174 TFEU, such bonds—possible under the EU’s Financial Regulation—could provide the backbone for grants to Member States to bolster the Union’s defence production capacity if paired with existing incentives for joint capabilities research, development, production, and procurement. This would avoid the two-speed logic and weaker conditionalities surrounding proposals to use the European Stability Mechanism (excluding key countries such as Poland, Sweden and Denmark) to issue loans to EU Member States for defence spending. Like how the Covid-induced Recovery and Resilience Facility stabilised European markets and sustained demand during and after the pandemic, Euro-defence bonds are a potential game-changer for the EU’s defence ambitions due to the potential speed and scale of resource mobilisation, and the potential impact on market de-fragmentation. And, fortunately, the German Constitutional Court should have nothing to object to this time around. And you can read the same in Scholz’s Zeitenwende, and in the speeches by Baerbock that Germany will lead the fight in Europe for the “rules-based order” while the US focuses on China. So what’s the problem with Trump telling them to get a move on? That they actually need to do it now rather than just talk? That Trump is more crass where someone like Biden would extol the trans-Atlantic alliance while shoving the knife in? Whatever Trump’s motivations, the faction of ascendant neocons who favor an American exit from Ukraine while making the Europeans spend more so that Washington can focus more on Iran and China are following a path long laid out. This is part and parcel of the neocon plan to use European vassals in an effort to preserve and expand the US empire. And the European political class is so far more than happy to go along. They don’t have much of a choice anymore: How much longer will the bloc’s citizens cooperate? To say Europe is in free fall would be an insult to gravity. And yet despite the endless stream of awful economic news, the political class’s complete detachment from reality, the embarrassing servility to the US, there isn’t yet a major threat to Europe’s willful vassalage. Germany’s upcoming election will be interesting to see how the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) perform. The two parties come at it from different angles, but both oppose bending the knee to Washington. They are currently polling at around a combined 24.5 percent, and barring an improvement, are likely to remain out of any ruling coalition. Until someone like the AfD or BSW can take charge, all the “crises” will continue working to the advantage of the few. Over the turbulent past few years in which real wages plummeted and deindustrialization took hold, the wealthiest added to their fortune and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen amassed more power that she uses for interests of the Western plutocrats centered in the US. With this being what the EU leaders of the “center” want and with the big bad orange man insisting upon more, they seem to compliment each other quite nicely. Many thanks for this article. Over the last day (following the temporary goods news about Haley and Pompeo) the Trump transition team have announced what has been arguably the most astounding list of cabinet level appointments in US history. They would appear to mark a total rout of the Carlson wing of the GOP by the Likudnik wing, with the most ‘advanced’ neocons taking control of the diplomatic, military and security levers of what we must now presumably call the Adelson/Musk Administration. As others have noted, a pathologically deluded Europe is going through a Morgenthau moment, and is almost anxious to help the US press it towards geostrategic perdition. It therefore seems to me that Ukraine, and most especially the Ukraine reconstruction bill, will be passed to the Europeans, but this is presumably chiefly so that the US can concentrate its fire upon the embers of Palestine (by proxy), and more especially upon Iran and China. If so, it would seem that Trump and his acolytes sincerely believe Russia can still be separated from China and/or Iran. Do they want another 1914 moment, this time with nuclear weapons, simply to prove the point that separating Russia from China may not now prove possible? Or is it that they wish to use nuclear brinkmanship to prise Russia from China? Or am I just being totally hysterical? There was a saying in Germany towards the end of WWII: enjoy the war, peace will be terrible. That is were our leaders are now. Not the nitwits like Baerbock and her green comrades. They are to stupid to understand that the war was lost from day one. But opportunists like the leading politicians from the legacy parties. They understand very well what beckons once the war is over. People will ask what it was all for? And why did it not end sooner? They will also have to somehow come to terms with Russia again. They are all in the same boat with Selensky in that they want this terrible day as far off as possible. And if this day will come at least they want it to be at a time when there are no elections soon. I believe that is why the German government finally disintegrated. They know very well that the end is nigh and they want it to happen after the elections when they have four more years for people to forget this disaster. As to Washington I follow Doug Mcgregor who evidently believes the new DefSec will finally acknowledge reality. Reality being that the US is way over its head militarily. The only conclusion can then be that the Ukraine war must be wount down. There´s fear and loathing at the prospect in the EU but it can´t be helped. The big question is whether the political system in Western Europe can survive this moment of truth. To me it feels like 1989 just before the break of the Berlin wall. The above sounds like what Tuchman called The March of Folly. The revival of oligarchy means they are back to a “whose is bigger” competition between owners of Dreadnoughts. The fact that a century after WW1 Europe is in the same antagonistic mess merely shows that human events revolve around competition between biological beings rather than economic algorithms. Only when the disaster becomes severe enough will we revert to another Age of Reason. However I’d say we need to wait and see what happens before assuming Trump is onboard with this. It could be he is indeed transactional and merely playing the part of the strongman to sweeten The Deal. I haven’t read his book so maybe it is all in there. Thank you and well said. I note your quip about the “likudnik wing”. Likud organises in the UK and has done since the 1940s. At first, it was called Herut until Herut and Likud merged four decades later. This is quite separate from the Conservative and Labour Friends of Israel. Modi’s BJP and RSS are beginning to organise in the UK and ally with Likud and CFI and LFI. The Zionist formations welcome such organisation as a means of beefing up numbers and influence. Great introspection into the false choices chicken hawks present to expand and continue their profitable wars and sanctions.. Vietnam, Iraq, Afgan, Ukraine, Israel, Syria. etc. None of the choices are peace. Trump may be forcing Britain and Europe (and of course Russia) to settle their own problems of security, terrorist attacks and mass killings. With those Eurobonds there will be a kicker. They just can’t be created out of thin air but will need to be backed by something as a form of collateral. And according to the guys at The Duran, this will be a EU tax that will be levied across every member state in the EU. All that money will be siphoned out of all those countries where it will be sent to Brussels where we can assume that it will be wisely spent and none of it pilfered. Maybe at first it will only be a very small tax but if there is one thing about taxes we know it is that it always goes up. And typing this I wonder if this might be turned into another tool in that “favoured” countries may get a rebate (Germany? France?) while everybody else has to pay full freight (Hungary? Slovakia?). The opportunities here for corruption are endless. Most of that money will end up in the US, to buy US weapons systems, LOL. Ursula’s plan, particularly the next 6 year budget proposal has not yet been disclosed so IMO it is too early to say what is at stake. EU budget is just 1% of EU GDP and most of it goes to the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy). If it is true that part of the CAP and cohesion funds are to be reduced and diverted to defence spending i believe the political discussion is going to be fierce. Also, the EC having no competence in defence, as per the treaties, i believe that finding those “holes” in the treaties for the EC to have its own defence budget would need a lot of overstretching of EU rules to the brink of rupture. IMO, it is almost certain this would require modifications of the treaties signed by each and all EU members. I might be mistaken but this has the same probabilities as the Eurobonds (null). Not to mention that the potential amounts to be directed to defence spending would not have probably any meaningful effect in defence capabilities in the EU to start with. So, this, I believe, so far doesn’t go beyond neocon dreams aired in loud voice by the neocon FT and balloon probes to test the waters. No covering any particular defence objective, if there is any it is only bureaucratic, risking disputes and discontent, what is the point here? I think the “road” to EU defense spending is through NATO. The likely story is that the EU and NATO will blend informally at first and more formally eventually. I believe the future belongs to militarism and permanent war (a cheap way to “unite” subject populations, i.e., the Europ public). It has worked in the USA despite losing every war every decade. The point is never to “win” but to keep the movement towards the ruling-classes dream of a neo-Orwellian world order. We’ll just have to see if that works–but that’s the agenda in my view. A big reason why I like ‘Naked Capitalism’ is that the comments are usually, not always, intelligently stated even if I don’t agree and which is a big difference compared to other sites so thanks much, Mike Liston Thanks for the kind words! Thank you! And your colleagues. Excellent piece, thanks! >”How much longer will the bloc’s citizens cooperate?” For another 2 decades for sure. Until critical wealth has been spent on trash. Right now German society is still too rich to experience a revolutionary moment. How much expense on 9/11 wars and social rollback were necessary for the GOP under Trump to be able to take WH & both houses with a popular vote? And considering that top 50% of US income starts at $100,000 annual wage – that´s still a rich country. The antisemitism resolution passed German parliament without a peep. Most educated will not vote for BSW because they are too anti-immigration. Putin & Xi are dictators and the Uyghurs are forced into camps and there is an Axis of Evil. As long as such narratives hold sway you won´t get political change. I’m not sure about “two decades” but you are, more or less, correct. As long as Western intel is in charge of the news media (IMHO) Europeans who are becoming as befuddled as North Americans with the “too much information age” are looking for narratives that work and that they can follow without disordering their lives with thinking for themselves and can continue to pursue empty lives of radical materialism (Euro people are prone to this). People who are confused crave meaning and crave to be ruled rather than rule themselves. Great comment Chris! Are you thinking of this USA election as a revolutionary moment? In true spirit of these times, I’ll bet the inequality continues to expand. It’s revolutionary times for billionaires…still. “Revolutionary,” as the word is often applied to the turmoil in the late Roman Republic. The oligarchy had become split into two main factions, the boni and the populares. These rivals were mostly drawn from the same class (Caesar, Clodius, Catiline were all aristocrats), but the populares appealed to the poorer citizens in order to gain an edge. When the boni were finally defeated, there was little fundamental change in the class structure of Roman society. Nevertheless, there was a considerable turnover in terms of the actual personnel composing the dominant class; a lot of Darwin Awards got handed out. Is there a parallel to the declining Romans “allying” with the Goths? Potential heirs to empire? Does the EU population want ascendant Germans? Russia and China are watching. My later observations about the PRC naval challenge is: how can the US Navy be more relevant and get some ships*? Resurgent Plan Orange, and Alfred Thayer Mahan’s thesis! A major naval force engagement concentration and mass! The US Navy needs 16 aircraft carriers, while they extend the lives of DDG (aegis destroyers) bc can’t get new ones out of build. *After squandering years and billions on the little crappy ships (LCS). Of course I’m just an simple peasant, but it seems to me that an investment in a ‘Manhattan Project,’ or a ‘moon shot’ of diplomacy around the world to resolve the issues that facilitate this destructive militarism, would be magnitudes cheaper, and much better for the planet and it’s inhabitants than the continual flogging of the ‘peace through strength’ strategy which historically has been quite counterproductive. In the words of the immortal Rodney King, “Why can’t we all just get along.” There is no interest in the Western Empire for “peace” because the need by the oligarchs is to maintain and enhance their control over their subject populations. How else are they going to maintain the rule of the corrupt and the ideology of hedonism and radical materialism? War is the answer to all their dreams and peace the major threat to the Imperial regime. Especially since the current concept of ‘western style democracy,’ has evolved into a system where the ability of politicians to get their name on a ballot, is primarily determined by which candidate is able to raise the most money by the advance selling of favors to billionaires whose interests don’t align with the majority of the electorate. Yup, that about sums it up. I feel like Matthew Modine in Altman’s “Short Cuts”, forced to sit through a dinner party with a vapid couple minutes after an argument with my wife in which she confessed a casual adultery like it was nothing. Sheer madness and I must endure. Sigh. Sometimes the simple ideas are always the best. George Orwell’s character in 1984–Emmanuel Goldstein–gave the best explanation for perpetual war: “The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink), is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.” The European people are our last hope. Putin may have overestimated his military capabilities when he attacked Ukraine. He certainly understands now that he could not invade Europe with any hope of victory or profit. However, the Russians may feel it necessary to fight in self-defense. The US has been lost now to militarist factions and ideology. Our only hope for the future seems to be European alliances, economic and military, with Russia as equals. What other hope is there. Europe cannot fail. Good idea, but it does it Exclude lid the US view of its importance? Which Would make it fail,or more accurately, forced onto failure . Definitely agree, we (UK and Europe) would be well rid of the US and their bullying. However they have so much printed money to spend and we know how greedy people are… Putin doesn’t have any military capability, unless you can count some judo by +70 year old. Russia, on the other hand, has one of the most powerful and capable military on Earth. That said, many (real) experts and commentators have stated that it will take a generation or two until Russia will even bother to piss on the rest of Europe* if it was on fire. EU and NATO have build a new Iron Curtain and it’s those two who will have to tear it down to have any significant role in the world. Or even survive. * Russia covers 40% of Europe, it’s the biggest country of the subcontinent. This smells a bit of western centrism. There are other modes. China is not doing too bad, nor Japan… This doesn’t meen europeans need to become Chinese… Does Europe intend to get into a hot war with Russia? Is that the purpose of the increased military spending? If not, it all seems silly from a capitalist perspective. Acquiring tens of billions of dollars of military hardware and then not using it means lots of expensive items collect dust and, more importantly, the arms merchants don’t have repeat sales which is anathema to capitalists everywhere. Europe is playing a very dangerous game arming up. The temptations to use the weapons will increase, and so will the risk of nuclear confrontation. There are lots of nice cultural icons across Europe. It would be a shame to lose them all. This extra ‘American LNG’ will also be Russian except bought via America. (They haven’t enough of their own fracked gas and it’s expensive for them.) Anyway, They dropped their own sanctions against Russian gas last week in preparation for a nice deal with Russia where they both profit. The Euros are such suckers! Why at least Germany does not sign a peace deal with Russia and turn on the remaining Nordstream is beyond me. Are you saying EU elites are DUMBER than the American voters? Yeah, well, I guess that’s not surprising, American elites (say about 90%) are dumber than American voters too. I’ve never seen a whole subcontinent of elites stick their head in the oven and turn on the gas this way. Crazy to watch. Sorry the rest of the EU gets to go along for the ride.

Title: Intel is far from becoming the American chipmaking powerhouse the US needs
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/intel-chip-troubles-problem-us-economy-domestic-production-chips-act-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-13T10:00:02Z
Full Content:
US government officials are counting on Intel to lead the country's chip manufacturing renaissance but the company is struggling to meet expectations. Intel becoming a globally competitive US chip manufacturer is "imperative for the US economy and national security," said Stephen Ezell, the vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and the director of its Center for Life Sciences Innovation. That's because the US needs to secure its domestic supply chains of the chips that power items like iPhones, washing machines, and military equipment. When it comes to bringing advanced chip manufacturing to American shores, the US government is short on options. Jimmy Goodrich, senior advisor for technology analysis to the RAND Corporation, told BI that only three companies in the world are manufacturing the most advanced, "leading edge" chips: Intel, Samsung, and TSMC. Intel is the only company in this trio that is based in America — Samsung's headquarters are in South Korea and TSMC is based in Taiwan. If Intel falls short, there is "reasonable concern that advanced fabs will not be sustainably available in the US," said Dylan Patel, the chief analyst at the semiconductor research and consulting firm SemiAnalysis. While Samsung is building a chip factory in Taylor, Texas the company has postponed taking deliveries of chipmaking equipment because it has yet to land any major customers for the project, Reuters reported in October. TSMC is producing chips for Apple in its Phoenix-based factory and has plans to build two more factories in the city. However, the company has historically preferred to invest in Taiwan, Patel said. These conditions are why Intel's recent struggles have raised concerns among some government officials. In August, the company announced it would be parting ways with roughly 15,000 workers through voluntary separation agreements and layoffs. On October 31, the company reported its biggest quarterly loss ever, driven by big restructuring and impairment charges. The company's financial performance has also been hindered by slowing demand for the chips that power personal computers and struggles to gain market share in the booming AI chips sector. To be sure, Intel's third-quarter revenue beat expectations, and executives said the company is making progress on executing a turnaround plan. In September, Intel announced it will be expanding its collaboration with Amazon Web Services, and the company is optimistic that its new 18A chip —which it's expected to start producing next year — will help it gain market share in the industry. However, industry analysts told Business Insider that competing with the likes of TSMC and Nvidia will be an uphill battle — in part due to a series of strategic missteps Intel has made over the past two decades. Another potential wild card is whether a Trump administration — specifically its proposed tariff policies — would aid or hinder Intel's turnaround efforts. President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support for boosting domestic chip manufacturing but has criticized the CHIPS Act, a key Biden administration initiative that companies like Intel are counting on for funding. An Intel spokesperson told BI that the company's recent quarterly earnings demonstrate the "tangible progress" the company is making on its turnaround strategy. They added that the goal of making the US a leader in semiconductor manufacturing was a priority in the first Trump administration and continues to have bipartisan support. "We look forward to working with President-elect Trump and his administration to advance America's technology and manufacturing leadership," they said. The stakes aren't just high for Intel employees and executives: Intel is the largest recipient of funding from the CHIPS Act, which included $52.7 billion in tax breaks and subsidies intended to bolster the US semiconductor industry. The Biden administration bet that boosting domestic chip manufacturing would make the US less reliant on chips sourced abroad from TSMC, which produces, by some estimates, about 90% of the world's advanced chips. Additionally, fears of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan complicate the US's dependence on TSMC. Intel was awarded $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion in loans through the CHIPS Act, which it plans to use to supplement the over $100 billion it's committed to expanding its operations in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico, and Oregon. Like most companies, Intel hasn't received any of these funds yet. Recipients are required to meet certain benchmarks — which can include building a chip fab or securing customers — before the funding is doled out. Intel has been in discussions with the US government over the milestones it must hit once its funding agreement is finalized, The New York Times reported in October. In response to the company's struggles, government officials have discussed whether it should receive additional financial support or merge its chip design business with a competitor. Last month, The New York Times reported that Gina Raimondo, the US secretary of commerce, urged chief executives from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and other firms to buy chips from Intel. "Our Q3 results underscore the solid progress we are making against the plan we outlined last quarter to reduce costs, simplify our portfolio, and improve organizational efficiency," CEO Pat Gelsinger said on the company's earnings call on October 31.

Title: The AI Tipping Point: Half of CFOs will axe AI investment if it doesn't show ROI next year

While this signals growing confidence in AI, it's accompanied by a strict demand for accountability. Half of CFOs (50%) report they will axe AI investment if it fails to deliver measurable ROI within a year, highlighting a narrow window for proving its impact. The findings were revealed in accounts payable automation Basware's AI to ROI Report, conducted by independent research firm Financial Times Longitude. The study surveyed 400 global CFOs and finance leaders on their attitude, priorities and challenges when it comes to AI in the finance department. Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2555171/Basware_1.jpg Uncertainty is Restricting Investment The biggest priority for financial leaders when implementing finance transformation projects is cost efficiency, with one-third (32%) listing it as their primary focus. However, any financial confidence will remain rocky with macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties continuing to swirl up until the end of the year, and beyond. This uncertainty is directly impacting AI adoption within finance functions, making it challenging for 41% of finance leaders to prioritize AI investment. No one is exempt from the fallout of uncertainty. Even Meta's latest earnings saw a reduced stock-price revision worth $5.1bn to reflect concerns over the company's capacity to mobilize AI investments and sustain growth. Meta has invested in a "significant acceleration" in AI-related infrastructure, but analysts warn that they need to prove they can continue to cover its rising AI costs and deliver ROI. For companies like Meta, a bounce-back is likely, but recoverability in the short-term isn't achievable for all. Unclear AI Strategy According to the report, finance leaders want to invest more in AI to reduce manual tasks and allow their teams to focus on priorities in their business. 70% of finance leaders said that staff want AI support for administrative tasks, while 75% report that AI has enabled their workforce to focus on more strategic activities such as e-invoicing compliance. However, the biggest barrier to finance transformation is change management and an unclear AI strategy. 40% of finance leaders state that their organization lacks change management capabilities, while 31% highlight a lack of clear strategic vision for the future of the finance function. Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2555172/Basware_2.jpg These factors hinder ROI for AI projects, resulting in question marks over investment without tangible financial benefits. Perttu Nihti, Chief Product Officer at Basware, commented on the new AI study:"The office of the CFO is tasked with overseeing a complex range of functions from regulatory compliance through to cash flow management and financial reporting. All of which are areas where AI-powered automation can help to reduce hours and relieve pressure. But the success of AI investment hangs on knowing where to start and proving impact. We're at the AI tipping point. Focusing on high-value wins, such as AI-powered efficiency that demonstrate quantifiable ROI quickly, in areas such as compliance, error reduction and fraud detection, will help justify investment across a company's organization." Turning Investment into Results Accounts Payable is one such starting point that is already returning greater levels of ROI. The survey revealed that organizations prioritizing AI investment are realizing a return of 136% ROI, with savings exceeding $1.36 for every $1m invested over the duration of three years. Among CFOs prioritizing AI innovation and applying it to processes in accounts payable, reducing errors, faster fraud detection, reduced operational costs and improved regulatory compliance were found to be the greatest benefits. How One Global Company Realized AI's ROI One example of how AI has driven ROI for an enterprise is paper and packaging manufacturer Billerud. The accounts payable team was previously hindered by time-consuming manual invoice processing, which cost them several hours each day. To address this inefficiency, they implemented Basware's SmartPDF AI Instant Learning solution, which uses AI and text extraction to convert PDF invoices into authentic e-invoices. Billerud has seen a substantial reduction of invoices needing validation, dropping from 15% to 9% due to AI Instant Learning, and saving AP staff several hours each day. Now, powered by AI, over 90% of their invoices are validated automatically due to faster, more accurate data extraction. Jesper Persson, Business Developer at Billerud, said:"Since day one, we've perceived the desired values from the project. The quality of invoices has improved considerably, and the AI continues to evolve and improve with each passing day. The efficiency gains we achieved translated directly into tangible cost savings, paving the way for a rapid return on investment within just a few months." The findings reveal a tipping point for AI in finance. While 50% of CFOs may cut AI investments without clear ROI, those that identify specific starting points for AI implementation - such as invoice processing automation - can achieve measurable returns within months rather than years. These successes are creating a blueprint for broader AI adoption across finance functions.

Title: Amazon is shutting down its free video streaming service, but there’s good news

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onNovember 13, 2024 Amazon Freevee first debuted in 2019 as IMDb Freedive. Since then, the service has offered viewers in select countries, including the US and UK, a limited, ad-supported catalog of TV shows at no cost. With Amazon now focusing on Prime Video, though, it will be phasing out Freevee in the coming weeks. According to Deadline, Amazon is retiring Freevee and redirecting users to Prime Video instead. The company will continue offering its original Freevee shows, such as Judy Justice and High School, through its Prime Video platform. Such content will be marked with a “Watch for Free” label, making it easy for free, non-Prime users to find and view them. An Amazon spokesperson told Deadline: Rumors about this move surfaced earlier this year when Amazon brought ads to Prime Video. With both Amazon-owned platforms now similarly offering ad-supported tiers, it makes little sense to maintain them separately. Behind the scenes, Freevee’s content and business teams have already been integrated into Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video, respectively. As a result, Amazon isn’t expected to lay off any of them for the time being. In a sense, the move is more of a merger between the two streaming platforms rather than a complete shutdown. It remains unclear whether the free content will eventually be available in more countries and regions as part of Amazon Prime Video.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 14 AI News Investors Are Paying Attention To. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks investors are paying attention to. The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI, now the most valuable private firm in the world, back in November 2022 had widespread implications for the technology industry. In the two years since the release, technology valuations, which had hit a snag due to broader inflation and slowing growth concerns, have jumped back up. Technology giants have surpassed multi-trillion dollar valuations and OpenAI itself has crossed $150 billion in value. In this environment, technology firms have been pushing for greater capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, telling investors that adding more data and computing power will consistently lead to improved AI models. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, news agency Reuters reports that new techniques being used by AI firms to train their AI models could reshape the AI arms race, and have implications for the types of resources that AI companies have an insatiable demand for, from energy to types of chips. For example, Ilya Sutskever, a Canadian-Israeli computer scientist who was one of the founders of OpenAI, has said that results from scaling up pre-training have plateaued. The computer scientist claims that the 2010s were the age of scaling, and now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing, and scaling the right thing matters more now than ever.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting. Market Capitalization: $2.2 Trillion Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. On November 9, tech website Android Authority reported that the AI-capable Tensor processors developed by Google for the Pixel line of smartphones had failed to meet financial targets. The report highlights that the financial goal for the tech titan is about $65 per chip to make the business viable. For additional context, the tech website claims that Qualcomm’s latest flagship chips cost around $150. Google released the latest Pixel phones earlier this year. The phones feature the on-device artificial intelligent assistant Gemini Nano and an array of generative AI features. Overall GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks investors are paying attention to. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Screenshot 2024-11-14 122343.png (NSE data show) Swiggy’s diversification strategy Swiggy’s revenue model spans multiple verticals, including its core food delivery service, Swiggy Instamart (grocery delivery), and Swiggy Genie (parcel delivery). This diverse service portfolio has helped Swiggy generate a gross revenue of ₹5,705 crore in the fiscal year 2023, representing a year-over-year growth of 40%. Swiggy Instamart alone contributed over ₹1,500 crore to Swiggy’s overall revenue, showcasing strong traction in the quick-commerce grocery sector. However, this broad approach comes with challenges. Swiggy’s operational expenses reached ₹7,280 crore in FY 2023, resulting in a net loss of ₹1,575 crore, a slight improvement from ₹1,850 crore in FY 2022. While Swiggy’s diversified model spreads risk, it also requires heavy capital investment, and the quick-commerce segment, in particular, has yet to show consistent profitability. Zomato’s focused business model Zomato, on the other hand, has opted to maintain a streamlined focus on food delivery, while experimenting selectively with quick-commerce following its acquisition of Blinkit. In FY 2023, Zomato reported a revenue of ₹6,300 crore, marking a 68% increase from ₹3,750 crore in FY 2022. Despite exiting grocery delivery early on, Zomato’s recent acquisition of Blinkit has contributed to its revenue and may provide additional growth potential if it successfully scales. Zomato’s net loss in FY 2023 was ₹450 crore, a notable improvement from ₹1,200 crore in FY 2022, reflecting its commitment to reducing operational inefficiencies and enhancing profitability. Unlike Swiggy, Zomato’s operating expenses were more concentrated, allowing it to streamline costs in food delivery. For investors, Zomato’s focused approach, coupled with this reduced net loss, demonstrates potential for achieving profitability earlier than Swiggy.

While there’s optimism about Swiggy’s potential to capture further market share in India’s Android evolving food delivery and quick commerce segments, the road to profitability may be bumpy. Swiggy has shown impressive growth potential, yet persistent losses over recent fiscal years signal challenges ahead. Investors may need to brace for a dynamic journey as the company seeks to balance expansion with sustainable financial performance.” Swiggy shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹454.35 as at 10.21 am after a fresh high at ₹489.40.

With Swiggy listing on the stock exchanges on November 13 at a premium, the debate intensifies over whether Swiggy or Zomato offers the better investment in India’s booming food delivery market Investors are keenly comparing Swiggy to its main competitor, Zomato, which has already experienced two years in the public market. Both companies are key players in India’s food delivery industry, valued at approximately $4.5 billion in 2023 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next five years. This analysis compares the financials, growth potential, and strategic directions of Swiggy and Zomato, shedding light on which platform may offer stronger returns. Market position and financial performance Both Swiggy and Zomato have carved out significant shares in the Indian market, with Zomato accounting for approximately 55% and Swiggy for about 45% of the market by 2023. However, the companies differ significantly in revenue composition and business models, which influence their respective investment potential. Track bl’s stock market live updates here Instamart essentially a play on broader retail; has immense potential to grow: We see immense growth potential in Instamart given QC is essentially a play on the broader retail market, which was sized at ~USD 1trln in CY22. While Swiggy tested the dark store-led business model first, sudden rise in competition and better execution by competition did lead to market share erosion. Despite that, in GOV terms, we estimate Instamart was only behind Blinkit as of FY24, with a market share of ~28%. Moreover, the QC channel penetration within the broader retail market even today is barely ~0.35%, compared to ~5-6% e-retail penetration. Even assuming the QC channel penetration will reach only 1.5-2% over the next 5 years, the market can expand at >50% CAGR. This will ensure exponential GOV/Revenue growth for Instamart over the medium term. Moreover, the QC business model has enough operating leverage to turn self-sustainable, when operating at scale. Screenshot 2024-11-13 143942.png Swiggy shares traded at ₹443 on the NSE, higher by 5.48% as at 2.17 pm. On the BSE, the stock climbed 7.91% to ₹444.60. Swiggy’s listing underscores the dominance of short-term subscribers, evident in the lukewarm participation from Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) and subdued retail interest. This can be attributed to the company’s higher valuation when compared to its only listed peer, making it challenging for investors to justify any frantic applying in IPO Despite this, I feel, Swiggy’s sectoral opportunity, its market share, and readiness are undeniable. In principle, the company’s potential warrants attention. However, considering the prevailing stock market dynamics with respect to Swiggy, it’s advisable to allow the dust to settle. The scrip is currently dominated by traders lacking a clear opinion on the company’s value proposition. The modest listing gain supports this assessment. Long-term investors should await an opportune time to accumulate Swiggy shares. The company’s December quarter performance will be crucial in backing the issue with tangible numbers. A decent financial reporting will validate Swiggy’s potential as a good long-term hold. - Tarun Singh Founder & MD, Highbrow Securities Swiggy.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.jpeg GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.’s shares climbed in their Mumbai debut, signaling a vote of confidence for large initial public offerings in India. The food-delivery firm listed at 416.20 rupees, about 7% higher than the selling price of 390 rupees, the top of the marketed range. The shares traded at 444.65 rupees at 11:47 a.m. local time, valuing the company at just under $12 billion. The $1.3 billion sale, the nation’s second-largest listing this year after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion IPO, comes as global funds are dumping local shares on concerns over earnings growth. Initial demand for Swiggy’s IPO was subdued, but institutional demand on the final day drove it to a strong close. Swiggy’s IPO was seen as a test of investor appetite for the country’s burgeoning quick-commerce sector. The debut pits the company against larger listed rival Zomato and privately-held Zepto in India’s rapid delivery space. According to CLSA, these firms are set to top $78 billion in combined gross orders within a decade. “These companies already have a good presence and people have gotten used to ordering,” said Pranav Bhavsar, a co-founder of Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. “It is hard to do away with that once you get used to it. That makes quick commerce a good theme to invest.” The listing defies the recent trend of weak performance among large first-time offerings in India. IPOs raising over $1 billion since 2019 have fallen by an average 3% on their first trading day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with an average 19% gain for all listings in the country for the period. Hyundai Motor India’s shares dipped on debut last month, and remain 12% below the IPO price. A handful more big listings are in the pipeline: state-backed NTPC Green Energy Ltd. is set to take bids for its up to $1.2 billion IPO next week. The Indian unit of LG Electronics Inc. and HDB Financial Services Ltd. are also gearing up for their debuts. “The India IPO market faces a cautious outlook following Hyundai’s underwhelming post-listing performance,” said Manish Bhargava, chief executive officer at Straits Investment Management in Singapore. “Investor skepticism is heightened, especially for startups with high valuations but uncertain profitability.” While Swiggy’s IPO attracted global funds including Fidelity International, the loss-making company faces challenges. Competition among quick commerce firms has caught the attention of India’s antitrust watchdog, which is investigating the company and Zomato for alleged unfair practices. Both the firms have said no final order has been issued. Fierce competition means increased spending on small-sized warehouses while “regulatory actions, such as welfare scheme for gig workers will be inflationary,” Macquarie Group analysts including Aditya Suresh wrote in a note. They initiated coverage with an underperform rating and a target of 325 rupees. Despite these hurdles, Swiggy’s growth is backed by strong online demand in one of the fastest-growing major economies. Its market share stood at about 37%, just behind Zomato’s 39% as of March 31, according to Chryseum Advisors, which tracks unlisted shares. “We see immense growth potential given quick commerce is essentially a play for the broader retail market, which was approximately $1 trillion in 2022,” JM Financial Institutional Securities Pvt. analysts wrote in a note. JM began coverage on Swiggy with a buy rating and a target of 470 rupees. The company was priced at about 40% discount to Zomato’s 12-month forward enterprise value to sales, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Zomato shares have more than doubled this year, with nearly all the 27 analysts covering the company recommending the stock as a buy. “Zomato trading up is providing a strong backdrop to Swiggy’s performance,” said Devi Subhakesan, an independent analyst from Investory Pte. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group Corp. and Prosus NV have more than doubled the value of their investments in Swiggy’s listing price. Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its debut. Bloomberg input Swiggy, India’s pioneering on-demand convenience platform backed by Prosus, has today listed on the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges of India (NSE and BSE), valuing the company at US$11.3 billion. Prosus sold shares worth more than US$500 million as part of the IPO. Prosus has been a cornerstone investor in Swiggy since 2017. Following the IPO, Prosus holds a c25%1 stake and maintains its two seats on the Board. Fabricio Bloisi, CEO of Prosus, said: “Everyone at Prosus extends huge congratulations to the Swiggy team on today’s IPO. We have supported the management team since our first investment in 2017 and have seen the company flourish in the post-pandemic era. It has diversified into new areas, expanded into new cities, and built an iconic consumer brand – placing Swiggy on a strong trajectory as a public company. Our investment in Swiggy highlights our commitment to building transformational companies and delivering returns for our shareholders by actively managing our portfolio. “India remains a key growth market for Prosus given the country’s impressive digital transformation in the consumer and enterprise sectors. We are excited about the region and see huge opportunity for value creation including a strong IPO pipeline within our current portfolio. Swiggy debuted at ₹420, marking a listing gain of 7.6%, which outpaced its grey market premium (GMP) estimate of just 0.26%. Retail investors showed modest interest, subscribing only 1.14 times, indicating low confidence. Current market conditions have kept many investors on the sidelines, especially as numerous high-quality companies remain 15-20% below their all-time highs. However, for those with a higher risk appetite, Swiggy could be an opportunity to capitalize on the valuation gap between Zomato and Swiggy, with potential gains hinging on Swiggy’s ability to enhance operational efficiency over time. - Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg (Source: X/@NSEIndia) According to Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart Ltd., the listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. “However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term,” Nyati added. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, advised allotted investors to hold for long-term despite knowing short-term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. Global brokerage Macquarie has initiated coverage on Swiggy with an underperform rating at a target price of ₹325. Meanwhile, domestic brokerage JM Financial has initiated coverage on the stock with ‘buy’ call at a target price of ₹470. The brokerage emphasised that a duopoly structure should ensure steady growth and profits. JM Financial says it would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments, while on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside. Madhu Balaji of businessline writes | ​Click to read​ Anand Daniel, Partner at Accel “As Swiggy hits the public bourses today, we at Accel reflect on the remarkable journey that Harsha, Nandan, and Phani, along with the Swiggy team, have undertaken. Being one of Swiggy’s first partners, when food delivery in India was still emerging, makes today especially meaningful. Guided by our thesis-led approach to food delivery, we were introduced to Harsha and his founding team in 2014—a connection that has since fueled countless innovations. This IPO is a testament to the grit, innovation, and consumer focus that Swiggy has consistently brought to the market. From ultra-fast grocery delivery with Instamart to ensuring safety and access during the pandemic, Swiggy has continually adapted to consumer needs with agility. Today’s IPO marks not only a milestone for Swiggy but a pivotal moment in India’s digital economy, impacting the daily lives of millions.” Swiggy shares rallied to hit day’s high at ₹449 on the NSE after listing at ₹420 today. Currently, as at 12.46 pm, the stock trades at ₹441.05, higher by 5.01%. While on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments. We, however, suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names and could, therefore, outperform the broader market returns. Despite subdued market mood and sluggish response from overall investors, Swiggy listing surprised the market participants. Positive listing and price holding above its issue price of 390 should be seen as strong demand for the company. This shows investors are positive on the space and fear of missing out factor is holding investors not to miss the sector growth story, similar to ZOMATO post listing trend. Post Listing: For allotted investors, HOLD FOR LONG TERM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit to buy near issue price if we get due to market selloff pressure. Swiggy, the leading food delivery and e-commerce platform in India, made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at around Rs 420, a 7.6% premium over its issue price of Rs 390. This performance is better than expected, considering the moderate subscription of 3.59 times and the initial muted investor response reflected in the low grey market premium. The listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term. Investors should approach Swiggy with a balanced perspective, considering the potential for future growth and the associated risks. Those who are holding it may keep a stop at around the issue price. ​​Swiggy shares​​ surged 6.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹447.65 as at 11.38 am.

Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. have invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its stock market debut in India on Wednesday. The food delivery firm is targeting an initial public offering valuation of up to $11.3 billion. Prosus will sell down shares in the IPO and retain 25% of Swiggy, similar to its stake in Tencent, Prosus’s Chief Investment Officer Ervin Tu said an interview. The share sale is expected to generate a return of more than $500 million for Prosus, he added. “We expect to benefit from the upside of the business, and the tailwinds of the fast-growing Indian market in future,” Tu said, noting that Prosus has invested in several Indian companies that could list on public markets.

Nearly 5,000 current and former employees are set to benefit, with around 500 Swiggy employees to enter the ‘crore-pati’ club when the firm makes its stock market debut, according to sources. Till date, Swiggy has has distributed ₹500 crore in Esops. In July this year, the company had announced its plan to buy back stocks worth up to $65 million. This kind of wealth creation by a new-age company is unmatched at this scale apart from Flipkart which hich has undertaken bigger scale of buyback or payouts in the past. In 2023, Flipkart had paid out a total of $700 million to 17,000 employees. Overall, Flipkart had over five share buybacks worth $1.4-1.5 billion in total over the past years. Swiggy’s founders and top management of Swiggy were allocated Esops worth nearly worth $271 million in its latest stock ownership plan. Investors probably won’t give a standing ovation for the e-commerce major’s market debut as they did when rival Zomato went public in 2021. Still, Swiggy can learn from Zomato’s epic stock meltdown the following year and an equally dramatic comeback since then. The best way for Swiggy to close the valuation gap with Zomato is to set clear profitability timeline and stick to the milestone targets. Investors love a good story, but Swiggy should bear in mind that these days, they’re quick to hit the sell button if earnings don’t meet estimates.

Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. Shares of food delivery and grocery major ​Swiggy ​will be listed at the bourses today. The company has fixed the IPO price as Rs 370, at the upper end of the price band ₹371-390. The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an​ oversubscription of 3.60 times​, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. ​KS Badri Narayanan of businessline writes​ Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Screenshot 2024-11-14 122343.png (NSE data show) Swiggy’s diversification strategy Swiggy’s revenue model spans multiple verticals, including its core food delivery service, Swiggy Instamart (grocery delivery), and Swiggy Genie (parcel delivery). This diverse service portfolio has helped Swiggy generate a gross revenue of ₹5,705 crore in the fiscal year 2023, representing a year-over-year growth of 40%. Swiggy Instamart alone contributed over ₹1,500 crore to Swiggy’s overall revenue, showcasing strong traction in the quick-commerce grocery sector. However, this broad approach comes with challenges. Swiggy’s operational expenses reached ₹7,280 crore in FY 2023, resulting in a net loss of ₹1,575 crore, a slight improvement from ₹1,850 crore in FY 2022. While Swiggy’s diversified model spreads risk, it also requires heavy capital investment, and the quick-commerce segment, in particular, has yet to show consistent profitability. Zomato’s focused business model Zomato, on the other hand, has opted to maintain a streamlined focus on food delivery, while experimenting selectively with quick-commerce following its acquisition of Blinkit. In FY 2023, Zomato reported a revenue of ₹6,300 crore, marking a 68% increase from ₹3,750 crore in FY 2022. Despite exiting grocery delivery early on, Zomato’s recent acquisition of Blinkit has contributed to its revenue and may provide additional growth potential if it successfully scales. Zomato’s net loss in FY 2023 was ₹450 crore, a notable improvement from ₹1,200 crore in FY 2022, reflecting its commitment to reducing operational inefficiencies and enhancing profitability. Unlike Swiggy, Zomato’s operating expenses were more concentrated, allowing it to streamline costs in food delivery. For investors, Zomato’s focused approach, coupled with this reduced net loss, demonstrates potential for achieving profitability earlier than Swiggy. Profitability remains a major concern for both companies, though they have made strides toward improving their unit economics.

With Swiggy listing on the stock exchanges on November 13 at a premium, the debate intensifies over whether Swiggy or Zomato offers the better investment in India’s booming food delivery market Investors are keenly comparing Swiggy to its main competitor, Zomato, which has already experienced two years in the public market. Both companies are key players in India’s food delivery industry, valued at approximately $4.5 billion in 2023 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next five years. This analysis compares the financials, growth potential, and strategic directions of Swiggy and Zomato, shedding light on which platform may offer stronger returns. Market position and financial performance Both Swiggy and Zomato have carved out significant shares in the Indian market, with Zomato accounting for approximately 55% and Swiggy for about 45% of the market by 2023. However, the companies differ significantly in revenue composition and business models, which influence their respective investment potential.

While Swiggy tested the dark store-led business model first, sudden rise in competition and better execution by competition did lead to market share erosion. Despite that, in GOV terms, we estimate Instamart was only behind Blinkit as of FY24, with a market share of ~28%. Moreover, the QC channel penetration within the broader retail market even today is barely ~0.35%, compared to ~5-6% e-retail penetration. Even assuming the QC channel penetration will reach only 1.5-2% over the next 5 years, the market can expand at >50% CAGR. This will ensure exponential GOV/Revenue growth for Instamart over the medium term. Moreover, the QC business model has enough operating leverage to turn self-sustainable, when operating at scale.

This can be attributed to the company’s higher valuation when compared to its only listed peer, making it challenging for investors to justify any frantic applying in IPO Despite this, I feel, Swiggy’s sectoral opportunity, its market share, and readiness are undeniable. In principle, the company’s potential warrants attention. However, considering the prevailing stock market dynamics with respect to Swiggy, it’s advisable to allow the dust to settle. The scrip is currently dominated by traders lacking a clear opinion on the company’s value proposition. The modest listing gain supports this assessment. Long-term investors should await an opportune time to accumulate Swiggy shares. The company’s December quarter performance will be crucial in backing the issue with tangible numbers. A decent financial reporting will validate Swiggy’s potential as a good long-term hold. - Tarun Singh Founder & MD, Highbrow Securities Swiggy.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.jpeg GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.’s shares climbed in their Mumbai debut, signaling a vote of confidence for large initial public offerings in India. The food-delivery firm listed at 416.20 rupees, about 7% higher than the selling price of 390 rupees, the top of the marketed range. The shares traded at 444.65 rupees at 11:47 a.m. local time, valuing the company at just under $12 billion. The $1.3 billion sale, the nation’s second-largest listing this year after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion IPO, comes as global funds are dumping local shares on concerns over earnings growth. Initial demand for Swiggy’s IPO was subdued, but institutional demand on the final day drove it to a strong close. Swiggy’s IPO was seen as a test of investor appetite for the country’s burgeoning quick-commerce sector. The debut pits the company against larger listed rival Zomato and privately-held Zepto in India’s rapid delivery space. According to CLSA, these firms are set to top $78 billion in combined gross orders within a decade. “These companies already have a good presence and people have gotten used to ordering,” said Pranav Bhavsar, a co-founder of Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. “It is hard to do away with that once you get used to it. That makes quick commerce a good theme to invest.” The listing defies the recent trend of weak performance among large first-time offerings in India. IPOs raising over $1 billion since 2019 have fallen by an average 3% on their first trading day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with an average 19% gain for all listings in the country for the period. Hyundai Motor India’s shares dipped on debut last month, and remain 12% below the IPO price. A handful more big listings are in the pipeline: state-backed NTPC Green Energy Ltd. is set to take bids for its up to $1.2 billion IPO next week. The Indian unit of LG Electronics Inc. and HDB Financial Services Ltd. are also gearing up for their debuts. “The India IPO market faces a cautious outlook following Hyundai’s underwhelming post-listing performance,” said Manish Bhargava, chief executive officer at Straits Investment Management in Singapore. “Investor skepticism is heightened, especially for startups with high valuations but uncertain profitability.” While Swiggy’s IPO attracted global funds including Fidelity International, the loss-making company faces challenges. Competition among quick commerce firms has caught the attention of India’s antitrust watchdog, which is investigating the company and Zomato for alleged unfair practices. Both the firms have said no final order has been issued. Fierce competition means increased spending on small-sized warehouses while “regulatory actions, such as welfare scheme for gig workers will be inflationary,” Macquarie Group analysts including Aditya Suresh wrote in a note. They initiated coverage with an underperform rating and a target of 325 rupees. Despite these hurdles, Swiggy’s growth is backed by strong online demand in one of the fastest-growing major economies. Its market share stood at about 37%, just behind Zomato’s 39% as of March 31, according to Chryseum Advisors, which tracks unlisted shares. “We see immense growth potential given quick commerce is essentially a play for the broader retail market, which was approximately $1 trillion in 2022,” JM Financial Institutional Securities Pvt. analysts wrote in a note. JM began coverage on Swiggy with a buy rating and a target of 470 rupees. The company was priced at about 40% discount to Zomato’s 12-month forward enterprise value to sales, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Zomato shares have more than doubled this year, with nearly all the 27 analysts covering the company recommending the stock as a buy. “Zomato trading up is providing a strong backdrop to Swiggy’s performance,” said Devi Subhakesan, an independent analyst from Investory Pte. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group Corp. and Prosus NV have more than doubled the value of their investments in Swiggy’s listing price. Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its debut. Bloomberg input Swiggy, India’s pioneering on-demand convenience platform backed by Prosus, has today listed on the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges of India (NSE and BSE), valuing the company at US$11.3 billion. Prosus sold shares worth more than US$500 million as part of the IPO. Prosus has been a cornerstone investor in Swiggy since 2017. Following the IPO, Prosus holds a c25%1 stake and maintains its two seats on the Board. Fabricio Bloisi, CEO of Prosus, said: “Everyone at Prosus extends huge congratulations to the Swiggy team on today’s IPO. We have supported the management team since our first investment in 2017 and have seen the company flourish in the post-pandemic era. It has diversified into new areas, expanded into new cities, and built an iconic consumer brand – placing Swiggy on a strong trajectory as a public company. Our investment in Swiggy highlights our commitment to building transformational companies and delivering returns for our shareholders by actively managing our portfolio. “India remains a key growth market for Prosus given the country’s impressive digital transformation in the consumer and enterprise sectors. We are excited about the region and see huge opportunity for value creation including a strong IPO pipeline within our current portfolio. Swiggy debuted at ₹420, marking a listing gain of 7.6%, which outpaced its grey market premium (GMP) estimate of just 0.26%. Retail investors showed modest interest, subscribing only 1.14 times, indicating low confidence. Current market conditions have kept many investors on the sidelines, especially as numerous high-quality companies remain 15-20% below their all-time highs. However, for those with a higher risk appetite, Swiggy could be an opportunity to capitalize on the valuation gap between Zomato and Swiggy, with potential gains hinging on Swiggy’s ability to enhance operational efficiency over time. - Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg (Source: X/@NSEIndia) According to Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart Ltd., the listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. “However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term,” Nyati added. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, advised allotted investors to hold for long-term despite knowing short-term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. Global brokerage Macquarie has initiated coverage on Swiggy with an underperform rating at a target price of ₹325. Meanwhile, domestic brokerage JM Financial has initiated coverage on the stock with ‘buy’ call at a target price of ₹470. The brokerage emphasised that a duopoly structure should ensure steady growth and profits. JM Financial says it would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments, while on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside. Madhu Balaji of businessline writes | ​Click to read​ Anand Daniel, Partner at Accel “As Swiggy hits the public bourses today, we at Accel reflect on the remarkable journey that Harsha, Nandan, and Phani, along with the Swiggy team, have undertaken. Being one of Swiggy’s first partners, when food delivery in India was still emerging, makes today especially meaningful. Guided by our thesis-led approach to food delivery, we were introduced to Harsha and his founding team in 2014—a connection that has since fueled countless innovations. This IPO is a testament to the grit, innovation, and consumer focus that Swiggy has consistently brought to the market. From ultra-fast grocery delivery with Instamart to ensuring safety and access during the pandemic, Swiggy has continually adapted to consumer needs with agility. Today’s IPO marks not only a milestone for Swiggy but a pivotal moment in India’s digital economy, impacting the daily lives of millions.” Swiggy shares rallied to hit day’s high at ₹449 on the NSE after listing at ₹420 today. Currently, as at 12.46 pm, the stock trades at ₹441.05, higher by 5.01%. While on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments. We, however, suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names and could, therefore, outperform the broader market returns. Despite subdued market mood and sluggish response from overall investors, Swiggy listing surprised the market participants. Positive listing and price holding above its issue price of 390 should be seen as strong demand for the company. This shows investors are positive on the space and fear of missing out factor is holding investors not to miss the sector growth story, similar to ZOMATO post listing trend. Post Listing: For allotted investors, HOLD FOR LONG TERM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit to buy near issue price if we get due to market selloff pressure. Swiggy, the leading food delivery and e-commerce platform in India, made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at around Rs 420, a 7.6% premium over its issue price of Rs 390. This performance is better than expected, considering the moderate subscription of 3.59 times and the initial muted investor response reflected in the low grey market premium. The listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term. Investors should approach Swiggy with a balanced perspective, considering the potential for future growth and the associated risks. Those who are holding it may keep a stop at around the issue price. ​​Swiggy shares​​ surged 6.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹447.65 as at 11.38 am. On the BSE, the stock climbed 8.65% to ₹447.65 JMFinancial on Swiggy Initiate Buy with TP of Rs 470 Food delivery – duopoly structure should ensure steady growth and profits Instamart essentially a play on broader retail; has immense potential to grow On an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, but we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one Zomato over Swiggy due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments Suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names Initiate U-P, TP Rs 325 India’s no-2 consumer app(FD, Quick Com, Out-of-Home), has a clear path to catch up with leader Zomato Quick Com more complex, with no sustainable economic profits Expect Group EBIT breakeven in FY28E even with 23% core rev CAGR Swiggy shares climbed 4.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹439.25 as at 11.05 am.

Swiggy shares debuted on the NSE at ₹420, at a 7.6% premium over the issue price of ₹390. Shares of Swiggy debuted 7.7% higher in pre-open trade on Wednesday, after institutional investors led its $1.4 billion initial public offering to be oversubscribed by more than three times last week. The stock is to be listed at ₹420 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), compared to its issue price of ₹390.

Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. have invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its stock market debut in India on Wednesday. The food delivery firm is targeting an initial public offering valuation of up to $11.3 billion. Prosus will sell down shares in the IPO and retain 25% of Swiggy, similar to its stake in Tencent, Prosus’s Chief Investment Officer Ervin Tu said an interview. The share sale is expected to generate a return of more than $500 million for Prosus, he added. “We expect to benefit from the upside of the business, and the tailwinds of the fast-growing Indian market in future,” Tu said, noting that Prosus has invested in several Indian companies that could list on public markets. Bloomberg report Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “We believe the majority of the investor especially NII’s & retail stayed back on few reason like Negative cash flow business model followed by concern on high competition and ongoing negative market mood. Considering low subscription demand from NII’s & Retail investors followed by market sentiments, there is a very high possibility of flat to negative listing in the range of +or - 5-10% on its issue price.” Track bl’s stock market live updates here Food tech major Swiggy’s IPO is set to unlock wealth to the tune of ₹9000 crore in employee stock ownership plan (Esop) wealth for its current and former employees, making it one of the largest wealth creation exercises of its kind in India’s startup ecosystem. Nearly 5,000 current and former employees are set to benefit, with around 500 Swiggy employees to enter the ‘crore-pati’ club when the firm makes its stock market debut, according to sources. Till date, Swiggy has has distributed ₹500 crore in Esops. In July this year, the company had announced its plan to buy back stocks worth up to $65 million. This kind of wealth creation by a new-age company is unmatched at this scale apart from Flipkart which hich has undertaken bigger scale of buyback or payouts in the past. In 2023, Flipkart had paid out a total of $700 million to 17,000 employees. Overall, Flipkart had over five share buybacks worth $1.4-1.5 billion in total over the past years. Swiggy’s founders and top management of Swiggy were allocated Esops worth nearly worth $271 million in its latest stock ownership plan. Investors probably won’t give a standing ovation for the e-commerce major’s market debut as they did when rival Zomato went public in 2021. Still, Swiggy can learn from Zomato’s epic stock meltdown the following year and an equally dramatic comeback since then. The best way for Swiggy to close the valuation gap with Zomato is to set clear profitability timeline and stick to the milestone targets. Investors love a good story, but Swiggy should bear in mind that these days, they’re quick to hit the sell button if earnings don’t meet estimates. Bloomberg input Food delivery and grocery major Swiggy’s initial public offering has been oversubscribed by 3.59 times after a tepid response in the first two days. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times — the highest, NII portion was booked 41 per cent and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. The ₹11,300-crore IPO comprises fresh capital raise of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹6,828 crore. Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. Shares of food delivery and grocery major ​Swiggy ​will be listed at the bourses today. The company has fixed the IPO price as Rs 370, at the upper end of the price band ₹371-390. The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an​ oversubscription of 3.60 times​, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. ​KS Badri Narayanan of businessline writes​ Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: Amazon Shutting Down Freevee Streaming Service (But There’s Good News)

Time Published: 2024-11-13T03:29:36Z

By Nicole Drum Amazon’s free, ad-supported streaming service Freevee is shutting down — but it’s not all bad news for fans of the platform. According to Deadline, Amazon is phasing out Freevee over the next few weeks and has already migrated Freevee content to Prime Video. New episodes of Freevee series, such as Judy Justice, Neighbours, Tribunal Justice, America’s Test Kitchen: The Next Generation and Bosch: Legacy will all be available for non-Prime customers, as will older originals including Jury Duty, High School, Hollywood Houselift with Jeff Lewis and Primo. What this means is for customers where Freevee is available — the U.S., U.K. Germany, and Austria — content labeled Freevee will now be designated as “Watch for Free” for non-Prime customers, meaning that you do not have to have an Amazon Prime membership to be able to watch. Additionally, samples of Prime Video originals, such as The Summer I Turned Pretty and first episodes of The Boys and Fallout, are expected to continue to be available in front of the Prime paywall as well for customers. Based on a statement from an Amazon spokesperson, the phasing out of Freevee is largely a branding measure. “We have built Prime Video into a first-stop entertainment destination where customers can personalize their viewing experience by streaming exclusive Prime member entertainment produced by Amazon MGM Studios, licensed movies and series, content form other services as an add-on subscription, live sports, blockbuster movies and series to rent or buy, FAST Channels and the complete Amazon Freevee content offering,” the spokesperson said. “To deliver a simpler viewing experience for customers, we have decided to phase out Freevee branding. There will be no change to the content available for prime members and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members, including select Originals from Amazon MGM Studios, a variety of licensed movies and series, and a broad library of FAST Channels — all available on Prime Video.” Freevee originally launched in January 2019 as IMDb Freedive before becoming IMDbTV that June. It was rebranded as Amazon Freevee in April 2022. Back in February, reports began to surface that Amazon was looking to shutter Freevee and shift focus to Prime Video, but such reports were denied by Amazon at that time. As for the company, it is being reported that no layoffs connected to the move are anticipated. The Freevee content team had previously been integrated into Amazon MGM Studios while its business team was already a part of Prime Video.

Title: Elastic N.V. (ESTC) Unveils ‘Better Binary Quantization’ to Enhance Elasticsearch for AI and Machine Learning Data Processing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other AI stocks that should not be ignored. Artificial Intelligence is driving an unprecedented expansion in the potential market size for hardware and software products. According to Bain & Company, the market for AI-related hardware and software will witness annual growth rates of 40% to 55% over the next three years, potentially reaching a valuation between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Companies investing in artificial intelligence know exactly how big of an opportunity this is and are determined not to miss it. Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO of WNS, a global business process management company, talked about its significance at the “CNBC Connect” event in Bangkok. According to Murugesh, many companies are underprepared for AI’s impact, particularly in areas such as government regulation. As such, there is clearly an upside to investing early in the technology. “Three years from now, if you are investing significantly in generative AI, you might be disappointed, right? As we have seen in many technologies, sometimes the hype is much bigger than the reality. But, three years from now if you are not investing in generative AI, you are going to be terrified. Because those companies that made the investments now, will be far ahead of you”. READ ALSO: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 8 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now Let’s look at the latest developments in artificial intelligence to assess how they are helping businesses, customers, and society to reach the next level of success. In its first, Chinese scientists have developed the first AI-powered robot lifeguard to stand watch over the riverside site in Luohe city. Using artificial intelligence, big data, and navigation and tracking technologies, the robot will operate without any human intervention. While it is not the first robot lifeguard, it is the first to be fully automated and needs no intervention, South China Morning Post reported. In other news, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged more than $65 billion of fresh support for the nation’s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector. The move comes in hopes of narrowing the gap between Tokyo and global powers on chip support. Ishiba notes that he wishes to spread positive examples of regional revitalization like TSMC’s chip plant in Kumamoto across the nation. Speaking of artificial intelligence, it seems that artificial intelligence companies are no longer scaling at the pace they were initially and that the outcomes from scaling up pre-training—the stage in AI model training where large volumes of unlabeled data are used to learn language patterns and structures—have seemingly reached a plateau. To overcome this plateau, researchers are now exploring “test-time compute,” a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called “inference” phase, or when the model is being used. This shift has the potential to reshape the AI landscape and impact the demand for hardware, challenging Nvidia’s dominance in training chips as the focus moves to the inference market. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company leverages AI across its product offerings, particularly within its “Elastic Stack” comprising Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash (also known as the ELK Stack) and more. On November 11, Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) introduced a new feature called Better Binary Quantization (BBQ) for Elasticsearch, the company’s open-source search and analytics engine. The BBQ tool will make it easier to store and work with complex data types known as vectors, which are often used in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The development of BBQ is a significant step toward data processing and storage, enhancing the capabilities of Elasticsearch. It is available as a tech preview for both self-managed and cloud users of Elasticsearch and will be contributed to Apache Lucene, an open-source Java library used as a search engine. Elasticsearch is built on top of Lucene. “Elasticsearch is evolving to become one of the best vector databases in the world, and we see our users wanting to put more and more vectorized data in it. Better Binary Quantization is our latest innovation to reduce the resources needed to store vectorized data and provide freedom to our users to vectorize all the things.” Overall ESTC ranks 13th on our list of the AI stocks that should not be ignored. While we acknowledge the potential of ESTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Bluesky Pulled a Million New Users After Election as More Abandoned Musk’s X

Time Published: 2024-11-13T01:20:01Z
Full Content:
By Miles Klee The reelection of Donald Trump as president last week brought a wave of jubilation to X (formerly Twitter). The influencers and megadonors who supported the Republican nominee delighted in the defeat of his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, while giddily speculating about the extremist agenda he would pursue once in office. The site’s owner, billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, who had drastically overhauled the platform to amplify far-right misinformation and hate speech, was particularly pleased. He announced in a post on Monday that the Super PAC through which he committed at least $119 million of his personal wealth to electing Trump would keep working to register more Republican voters in “key districts around the country.” For many who had hoped to see Trump lose, and were already on the fence about leaving X, this victory lap provided as good an occasion as any to finally log off. Many users noted a steady loss of hundreds or even thousands of followers as accounts were deactivated, continuing a downward trend in activity since Musk’s takeover of the social network in late 2022. Meanwhile, its direct competitors — Bluesky and Threads — once again saw an influx of new users apparently fleeing the toxic conversation on X. Bluesky, a decentralized service developed as a project under former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and then incorporated as a separate company, announced on Tuesday that in the week since the election it had added 1 million users, bringing it close to 15 million registered users altogether. It opened to the public in February after previously being invite-only. With a more left-leaning sensibility and a focus on transparency and user safety, it is favored by those increasingly alienated by the politics of Musk and X, or vulnerable to harassment there. (Marginalized groups including transgender and disabled people are well represented on the platform.) Threads, a Twitter-like app by Meta that is linked to a user’s Instagram account, has not disclosed a post-election spike in sign-ups. But on Monday, the network’s official account posted an update welcoming newcomers and sharing tips for how to optimize the service. With Meta’s established user base, it expanded quickly after launching in July 2023, and the weekend before the election, the company said Threads had reached 275 million monthly active users. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also revealed that a million people sign up for the service every day. “We’ve been pleased to see Threads’ steady growth since it launched last year,” a Meta spokesperson tells Rolling Stone. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time In contrast to Bluesky, which shows users posts from people they follow in chronological order and offers specialized feeds including a “Discover” section, Threads is more aggressively algorithmic, showing posts non-chronologically and inserting recommended content into your main feed. (X’s “For You” feed is similar, though on that site users can opt to scroll a feed of content only from accounts you’re following.) It hosts more mainstream brands, news outlets, celebrities, and pundits, but it also doesn’t recommend political content unless a user explicitly asks for it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, it feels more like Facebook than Bluesky, where an anarchic “shitposting” culture tends to dominate, and famous faces are not always welcome. “Bluesky Social” became a trending topic on Threads on Tuesday as users reacted to the news of its rapid growth. Preferences between the two platforms differ, such that both have lately seen an uptick in discussion about the pros and cons of each. This in itself was another indication that people who once relied on X to stay informed and connected are thinking about their best alternatives in the fragmenting landscape of social media. Meanwhile, X’s future as it continues to lose liberal and moderate voices, leaving MAGA diehards to revel in a second Trump term, is murky at best. In becoming a political bullhorn for the right, it now more closely resembles Truth Social, the app Trump rolled out in 2022 after he was permanently suspended from Twitter. (Musk later reinstated his account.) With its distinct focus on Trump himself, Truth Social has struggled to attract a user base, though in an interview the morning following the election, tech journalist Kara Swisher speculated that X and Truth Social — both failing businesses but useful when it comes to propagandizing — could merge into one company, with Musk and Trump profiting off it as a so-called “meme stock,” one whose price is driven up through viral hype among retail investors.

The BSE Sensex plunged 984.23 points or 1.25 per cent to close at 77,690.95, while the broader NSE Nifty50 fell 324.40 points or 1.36 per cent to end at 23,559.05. The market breadth was heavily skewed towards decliners, with 3,299 stocks falling against 670 advances on the BSE. “Relentless selling by FIIs amid weak corporate earnings and a sharp surge in domestic inflation to a 14-month high have further impacted investor sentiment, dashing hopes for a near-term rate cut by the RBI,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Read more The shares of Greaves Cotton Ltd were trading at ₹159.05, down by ₹20.14 or 11.24 per cent on the NSE near the closing bell. Greaves Cotton Ltd reported consolidated revenue of ₹705 crore for Q2 FY25, with standalone revenue growing by 2 per cent to ₹468 crore, according to its financial results released on November 12, 2024. The engineering company’s newly acquired Excel division contributed ₹61 crore to the quarterly revenue. Read more The rupee moved in a narrow range and appreciated 1 paisa to close at 84.38 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, as persistent foreign fund outflows and a muted trend in domestic equities weighed on the local unit. The USD/INR pair is trading in a narrow range as the strength of the American currency in the overseas market dented investor sentiment, while suspected intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the rupee supported at lower levels, forex traders said. Read more As India’s 2024 wedding season approaches, gold prices are expected to be impacted by both local demand and global market dynamics. Traditionally, India’s wedding season drives significant gold purchases, and with an estimated 48 lakh weddings from November to December, demand is forecast to remain high, potentially keeping prices elevated. However, record-high prices in 2024 may temper demand, leading some consumers to seek smaller quantities or alternative investment forms. Discounts and jeweller incentives might help moderate prices, yet global factors like US interest rates could keep prices volatile. Kalyan Jewellers India Limited reported a consolidated revenue of ₹11,601 crore for the first half of FY25, marking a 32 per cent increase from ₹8,790 crore in the same period last year. The jewellery retailer’s consolidated profit after tax (PAT) reached ₹308 crore in H1 FY25, up from ₹278 crore in H1 FY24. Read more Top gainers: Britannia (0.40%), Grasim (0.35%), Tata Motors (0.25%), Asian Paints (0.13%), NTPC (0.04%) Top losers: Hero Motocorp (-4.21%), M&M (-3.47%), Hindalco (-3.40%), Tata Steel (-3.11%), Eicher Motors (-2.94%) Today’s decline marked the indices’ fifth straight session of losses amid persistent selling pressure from foreign institutional investors (FIIs), with broader market sentiment hampered by a confluence of factors shaking investor confidence. The correction reflects investors’ growing caution amid rich valuations and macroeconomic uncertainties, with both Nifty and Sensex falling to their respective five-month lows today. This latest downturn was intensified by sustained foreign investor outflows, disappointing corporate earnings, and rising inflation. Since late September, foreign investors have withdrawn approximately $14 billion from Indian equities Corporate earnings have also failed to reassure markets, with several companies reporting their weakest quarterly performances in over four years. Adding to the strain, October’s retail inflation reached a 14-month high of 6.21 percent, dampening hopes of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India in the near future. Further, with today marking the end of weekly Bank Nifty derivatives contracts, traders are expected to be unwinding positions, possibly weighing on banking stocks. Ram Ratna Wires Limited (RRWL) announced today its acquisition of a 60 per cent controlling stake in Tefabo Product Private Limited, a manufacturer of fabricated components and assemblies. The remaining 40 per cent stake will be held by Anup Balkrishna Vaidya.

Retail investors showed modest interest, subscribing only 1.14 times, indicating low confidence. Current market conditions have kept many investors on the sidelines, especially as numerous high-quality companies remain 15-20% below their all-time highs. However, for those with a higher risk appetite, Swiggy could be an opportunity to capitalize on the valuation gap between Zomato and Swiggy, with potential gains hinging on Swiggy’s ability to enhance operational efficiency over time.

Swiggy Swiggy, the leading food delivery and e-commerce platform in India, made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at around Rs 420, a 7.6% premium over its issue price of Rs 390. This performance is better than expected, considering the moderate subscription of 3.59 times and the initial muted investor response reflected in the low grey market premium. The listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term. Investors should approach Swiggy with a balanced perspective, considering the potential for future growth and the associated risks. Those who are holding it may keep a stop at around the issue price. Acme Clean Energy Acme Clean Energy Limited made a disappointing debut on the stock market, listing at Rs. 251 per share, a 13% discount to its issue price of Rs. 289. This negative listing, despite a moderate subscription of 2.89 times, indicates a subdued investor response. While the company operates in the promising renewable energy sector and has demonstrated strong growth and improved profitability, the high debt-to-equity ratio and the overall market sentiment might have influenced the negative listing. Investors who participated in the IPO should carefully consider their investment strategy and may want to reassess their holding based on the company’s future performance and market dynamics Top gainers on the NSE as at 12.13 pm: NTPC (1.28%), Trent (0.42%), Tata Motors (0.34%), Bharti Airtel (0.33%), Britannia (0.25%) Top losers: Hindalco (-3.74%), Eicher Motors (-3.63%), Tata Steel (-3.32%), M&M (-3.23%), Hero Motocorp (-3.07%) A fire occurred at IndianOil’s Mathura Refinery (on Nov 12 ) during the start-up of the Crude Distillation Unit following a planned maintenance shutdown.

There are concerns over the US President-elect Donald Trump’s potential aggressive trade policies. This has led to strengthening of dollar and a fall of rupee to fresh low earlier today, which triggered fears of further foreign outflows. Persistent FII selling since late September along with softer-than-expected Q2 earnings are the major reasons behind the decline. Markets will be seen reacting to domestic CPI and Industrial production data to be announced later today while US CPI numbers will be out tomorrow. Investors will also look forward to the IPO listing of Swiggy and Acme Solar shares tomorrow. We expect markets to remain volatile with stock specific action on account of balance Q2 numbers to be announced this week. Key results tomorrow include Eicher Motors, Torrent Power, Kalyan Jewellers, PI Industries amongst others. -- Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities sharing his views: Wall Street’s three major indexes closed lower on Tuesday as investors booked some profits from a post-election rally and waited eagerly for U.S. inflation data due this week. Treasury yields soared and the dollar hit the highest level in two years ahead of a key inflation report. European shares lost 2% as European Central Bank policymakers warned that increased tariffs from Trump would hamper global growth. The US consumer-price index is forecast to rise 0.2% in October based on a survey of economists polled by the Wall Street Journal. The CPI report comes out Wednesday morning. India’s retail inflation rose to a 14-month high of 6.2 percent in October compared with 5.5 percent in the previous month, as food inflation galloped on the back of rising vegetable prices. The annual retail inflation was higher than the estimate of 5.81% in a Reuters poll of 45 economists. In September, inflation stood at 5.49%, which was a nine-month high. CPI breached RBI’s upper band target of 6 percent for the first time in over a year, raising fears that the Reserve Bank of India may hold rates for the eleventh consecutive time at its meeting in December. India’s factory output, measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), grew 3.1% YoY in September, as against (-)0.1% in August, mainly due to an uptick in manufacturing activity. On a sequential basis, the IIP grew 0.7% in September, marking the first month-on-month acceleration in activity since May. Asian stocks fell to the lowest level in almost two months before US inflation data that may further cut confidence in the pace of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. Nifty fell for the fourth consecutive session on Nov 12 and closed at the lowest in 4.5 months amidst dull buying interest which failed to offset the FPI sales. IT stocks are proving to be resilient in this down trending market. Nifty formed a long bear candle on Nov 12 and broke the near term supports in the fall seen over the last few days. It now seems headed to 23670. On bounces 24151 may be tough to breach in the near term. While Nifty has remained oversold for some time and it may be late for some profit booking, we may still see sell on rises in the near term.

We expect Nov’24 inflation numbers are likely to be closer to 5.3% and the average FY25 inflation numbers are now trending at 4.8%-4.9%, against RBI 4.5%. Inflation is only likely to dip from January onwards, but this will be driven by base effects. We are now less hopeful of a February rate cut. We believe the first rate cut is now effectively pushed back beyond Feb’25. If we look the State-wise Inflation, inflation in bigger states continue to outstrip the all India inflation rate of the same month. Among the States, Chhattisgarh clocked the highest inflation rate of 8.8% in Oct, followed by Bihar at 7.9% and Odisha at 7.5%. Interestingly, a comparison of year on year changes and year to date changes reveal that year on year changes are far outpacing year to date changes. For example, there are 7 states, whose year-on year inflation has crossed more than 2% in a year. These indicates that the momentum of food prices has continued to climb up. The gap between urban and rural consumers’ inflation trends was sharp for the 8th consecutive month, with rural households paying 1.07% higher than urban India. This is mainly due to the higher food prices and the rural basket of food items weight (54.2%) is higher than the urban weights (36.3%). We believe that there will be some moderation in vegetable prices in month of November. The retail prices data till 11 Nov, indicate decline in vegetable prices. CPI headline inflation has peaked in Oct’24, but November and December numbers could still be higher than 5%. With the currency market being subject to turbulence , we believe a higher inflation number could act as a blessing in disguise for RBI not to signal a rate easing cycle.

Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. 19.00 U.S. CPI m/m (Expected: 0.2% versus Previous: 0.2%) 20.15 U.S. FOMC Member Logan Speaks 23.30 U.S. FOMC Member Musalem Speaks CyberArk Software Ltd (Pre market) (Sector- Technology) Cisco Systems, Inc.

Its Q2-FY25 revenue/EBITDA/PAT growth at 20/32/43 per cent y-o-y were ahead of BNP Paribas expectation. We raise our FY25-27E EPS by 3-5 per cent and expect Doms to double its earnings over FY24-27. ONGC’s Q2-FY25 standalone EBITDA, at ₹18,200 crore, was slightly lower than JM Financial’s expectation of ₹18,800 crore (but in line with consensus of ₹18,200 crore) due to crude sales volume being 3 per cent below JMFe, but that was partly offset by net crude realisation being $1/bbl above JMFe at $ 74.3/bbl. Gas sales volume and realisation were largely in line. However, ONGC’s standalone PAT, at ₹12,000 crore, was significantly above JMFe/consensus of ₹9,200 crore due to higher other income, lower dry well write-off and lower tax-rate. OVL’s crude and gas production continued to be weak; PAT was also lower QoQ due to higher opex. Gift Nifty at 23,870 indicates a gap-down opening of about 100 points for Nifty on Wednesday amid weak global cues. The market is now facing a double whammy of earnings slowdown and higher inflation. With foreign portfolio investors continuing their selling without relaxing, analysts expect the market to remain under a bear grip, they added.

Title: Amazon to Shut Down Freevee in Consolidation to Prime Video
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/amazon-freevee-shut-down-prime-video/
Time Published: 2024-11-12T23:33:21Z
Full Content:
Original series like “Jury Duty” and “Bosch: Legacy” will remain on Prime Video without a paywall Amazon is preparing to shutter the doors on Freevee, its free, ad-supported streaming service housed within Prime Video. The tech giant will soon phase out Amazon Freevee as it consolidates its content into Prime Video. Original series including “Jury Duty,” “Bosch: Legacy” and “Judy Justice” will remain on Prime Video without a paywall. “We have built Prime Video into a first-stop entertainment destination where customers can personalize their viewing experience by streaming exclusive Prime member entertainment produced by Amazon MGM Studios, licensed movies and series, content from other services as an add-on subscription, live sports, blockbuster movies and series to rent or buy, FAST Channels and the complete Amazon Freevee content offering,” an Amazon spokesperson said on Tuesday. “To deliver a simpler viewing experience for customers, we have decided to phase out Freevee branding,” they announced. “There will be no change to the content available for Prime members, and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members, including select originals from Amazon MGM Studios, a variety of licensed movies and series, and a broad library of FAST Channels – all available on Prime Video.” Markets where Freevee launched, including the U.S., U.K., Germany and Austria, will see its content now labeled “Watch for Free” as an offering for non-Prime users to enjoy without a membership. No layoffs are expected from this development, since Freevee’s content team was already integrated into Amazon MGM Studios, and its business team was already part of the larger Prime Video umbrella. The writing was on the wall for the phasing out of Amazon Freevee ever since Prime Video unveiled its ad tier in January. The company previously shut down rumors of Freevee’s shuttering in February. The streamer first launched as IMDb TV until a rebrand in 2022. Prime Video’s ad-supported tier, which serves as the default for all subscribers, is available to more than 200 million monthly viewers, including 115 million in the U.S. Amazon Prime, which includes Prime Video, costs $14.99 per month or $139 a year. A membership that only includes Prime Video and none of the company’s shipping benefits costs $8.99 a month. Users can pay an extra $2.99 per month for an ad-free experience. Amazon secured more than $1.8 billion in advertiser commitments for its streaming services during its inaugural upfront presentation in New York City — topping the tech company’s internal expectations. “Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. This quarter, we saw strong growth on an increasing large base of advertising revenue,” chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts during the company’s Q3 earnings call in October. “There are many opportunities to further expand our ads offering in areas that are driving growth today, like sponsored products, as well as more recent growth areas like Prime Video Ads.” Deadline first reported the news.

Title: Freevee To Shut Down Out As Amazon Consolidates Subscription & Free Content Under Prime Video
URL: http://deadline.com/2024/11/freevee-shut-down-amazon-prime-video-1236172644/
Time Published: 2024-11-12T23:20:18Z

By Nellie Andreeva Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV EXCLUSIVE: It’s official — free, ad-supported video on demand streaming service Amazon Freevee, the home of such originals as Jury Duty, Bosch: Legacy and Judy Justice, will be phased out over the coming weeks. Its content, which already has migrated and is available on Prime Video, will remain there, with new episodes of Freevee shows, including Judy Justice, Neighbours, Tribunal Justice, America’s Test Kitchen: The Next Generation and Bosch: Legacy, as well as older originals, including Jury Duty, High School, Hollywood Houselift with Jeff Lewis and Primo, staying in front of the paywall and available to non-Prime customers. Related Stories Documentary New On Prime Video For November 2024: Daily Listings For Streaming TV, Movies & More News Milestone PBS-Amazon Deal Will Bring 150 Local Stations, Two New FAST Channels To Prime Video The update will be deployed in the territories where Freevee is currently available, the U.S., UK, Germany and Austria. Going forward, the content currently labeled as Freevee will be designated for non-Prime customers as “Watch for Free” on detail pages. Watch on Deadline No layoffs related to the move are expected. As part of previous restructurings, Freevee’s content team already had been integrated into Amazon MGM Studios; its business team has been part of Prime Video. With the consolidation, Amazon is leaning into Prime Video already being a hybrid destination for both Prime members and non-members. It is broader than a typical streamer as it also offers new and old movies to rent or buy, a library of FAST Channels as well as sample of Prime Video originals in front of the paywall, like the first season of The Summer I Turned Pretty, first three episodes of The Boys and the first episode of Fallout. That will continue. “We have built Prime Video into a first-stop entertainment destination where customers can personalize their viewing experience by streaming exclusive Prime member entertainment produced by Amazon MGM Studios, licensed movies and series, content from other services as an add-on subscription, live sports, blockbuster movies and series to rent or buy, FAST Channels and the complete Amazon Freevee content offering,” an Amazon spokesperson said. “To deliver a simpler viewing experience for customers, we have decided to phase out Freevee branding. There will be no change to the content available for Prime members, and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members, including select Originals from Amazon MGM Studios, a variety of licensed movies and series, and a broad library of FAST Channels – all available on Prime Video.” Speculation about Freevee going away have circulated since Amazon announced at the end of last year that Prime Video would be introducing ads Jan. 29, 2024. The move largely eliminated the distinction between Prime Video, Amazon’s subscription video on demand (SVOD) streaming platform, and Freevee, its sibling AVOD service. (Through the acquisition of MGM, Amazon also owns SVOD platform MGM+.) Freevee helped get Amazon’s toe into the advertising business. The company then instantly became the dominant player in the field when Prime Video flipped the switch to an ad-supported model having been partially in the game since its acquisition of Thursday Night Football. Still, Amazon in February pushed back at rumors that it was planning to shut down Freevee, calling the platform “an important streaming offering providing both Prime and non-Prime customers thousands of hit movies, shows, and originals, all for free.” But there was very little mention of Freevee at the Amazon Prime upfront in May, with Prime Video as the prime focus of the company’s pitch to advertisers. Freevee scripted original series such as American Rust: Broken Justice and the upcoming On Call had already started migrating to Prime Video before its introduction of ads. That was followed in the past few months by the announcement that the third and final season of Bosch: Legacy would be shared across Freevee and Prime Video, with Freevee’s latest new scripted series, The Pradeeps of Pittsburgh, also recently debuting on both platforms. Shows like Judy Justice, Tribunal Justice and Hollywood Houselift With Jeff Lewis also were made available on Prime Video, while the Freevee live FAST channels were rebranded as Amazon Prime Video Channels on Fire TV. While scripted series development across the company had been centralized at Amazon MGM Studios, producers still had been able to pitch shows to Freevee. I hear recently all upcoming pitch meetings as well as any pending deals for such projects have been canceled. Freevee traces its roots back to January 2019, when it was launched by Amazon subsidiary IMDb as Freedive. It was subsequently rebranded as IMDb TV, Freevee and Amazon Freevee. Jury Duty proved a breakout hit for Freevee, earning four Emmy nominations, including one for Outstanding Comedy Series. Other notable series that originated at Freevee include Bosch: Legacy, continuing one of Prime Video’s signature series. Amazon hasn’t broken out viewership stats, but said in 2022 when it rebranded the service to Freevee that its monthly active user base had tripled between 2020 and ’22 to 65 million.

Title: How Wall Street is reacting to a second Trump term in 8 different sectors

Double your support for intelligent, in-depth, trustworthy journalism. Follow 2024 live results Associated Press Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy. Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they’ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs. READ MORE: Biden spurred new factories and infrastructure projects. Trump will be in office for the ribbon-cutting Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else. — Stan Choe Here’s a look at where Wall Street is placing its bets at the moment. Technology stocks soared in Trump’s first term, helped by the administration’s tax policies. But the relationship was tempestuous: Trump’s immigration stance threatened a source of high-skilled immigrants that comprises a significant part of the industry’s work force and his trade wars threatened international sales and supply chains. This time around, tech could benefit from an anticipated loosening of antitrust regulation that discouraged big deals from getting done and threatened to rein in the power of Google, Apple and Amazon. What’s more, Trump is expected to clear the way for Big Tech to make more inroads in artificial intelligence technology — an area increasingly seen as a crucial battleground in the duel for global power between the U.S. and China. READ MORE: Trump promised to save TikTok, but what happens next is not clear Trump’s vow to impose tariffs and other restrictions on trade does pose a potential downside for chip makers, particularly stock market darling Nvidia. A possible rollback of Biden administration efforts to boost U.S. semiconductor production also is a concern. Still, in a sign of tech’s more conciliatory attitude, Trump’s election was greeted by congratulatory posts from most of the industry’s luminaries, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. — Michael Liedtke Trump’s victory brings a big dose of uncertainty for the retail industry. Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He also wants to further cut the corporate tax rate. Those would be tailwinds for shoppers and businesses, analysts said. But the president-elect’s trade proposals could have a huge downside. He’s proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and tariffs of 10% to 20% on other imports. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, said retailers would either take a big hit on profits or be forced to increase prices. As opposed to Trump’s first term, retailers will have a harder time absorbing tariffs this time because their costs of doing business are already higher, Saunders said. READ MORE: Stocks and bitcoin soar after Trump’s victory, while inflation worries rise; Dow surges 1,200 Many companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year. The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher prices for U.S. shoppers if Trump’s new tariffs are implemented. For example, an $80 pair of men’s jeans would cost $90 to $96. — Anne D’Innocenzio Trump has said he wants to “drill, drill, drill” starting on Day 1 of his presidency, so it’s expected that traditional fossil fuel-focused companies will get a boost and renewable energy outfits could be disadvantaged. Oilfield services companies including Haliburton and Schlumberger would likely benefit from initiatives to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Natural gas companies including EQT and CNX Resources could benefit from facilities and pipeline projects. Meanwhile, clean energy companies, such as First Solar and many electric vehicle makers, could have a harder time growing if Trump cuts tax credits and other incentives for the industry. READ MORE: Top U.S. climate negotiator vows ‘we won’t revert back’ after Trump reelection But remember Trump’s first term, says Austin Pickle, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The thought back then, like now, was that Trump would boost prices for oil-and-gas stocks. But energy stocks ended up struggling late in his term when the price of oil briefly went below zero during the COVID-19 pandemic. — Damian Troise Drugmakers, insurers and other health care companies could benefit from fewer regulatory roadblocks to mergers and a lighter regulatory stance overall. Insurers, in particular, may see some regulatory relief for Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of the government’s Medicare program mainly for people ages 65 and older. Under Democratic leadership, some insurers were facing smaller bonus payments tied to their Medicare Advantage plans. Some drugmakers are facing revenue hits on certain drugs covered by Medicare. Those challenges could abate under Republican rule, analysts at Morningstar noted. A second Trump administration also may challenge health care companies. The approval of drugs and vaccines could become less predictable, depending on the role anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plays, said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. Health insurers that sell coverage on the Affordable Care Act’s insurance marketplaces or manage state-and-federally funded Medicaid coverage could face challenges if Republicans attempt to dismantle parts of the law, said Julie Utterback of Morningstar. In particular, extra subsidies that help people buy marketplace coverage are slated to expire at the end of next year, which could lead to enrollment drops. — Tom Murphy The auto industry is another that should welcome less restrictive regulations but dread tariffs. Trump is likely to roll back or scrap tailpipe emissions limits for 2027 through 2032 imposed by the Biden administration. Companies like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis could more easily sell larger, less-efficient vehicles without paying hefty fines. Companies would also face less pressure to sell more electric vehicles to offset emissions from big trucks and SUVs, which make big profit margins, said Kevin Tynan, research director for The Presidio Group. Tariffs are a different story. Trump has threatened tariffs on imported vehicles to force more production in the U.S. The threat of 100% tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico is a big concern. Morningstar analyst David Whiston said such tariffs could potentially cost General Motors, Stellantis and Ford billions in profits. About 30% of GM’s North American production comes from Mexico, while it’s 24% for Stellantis and about 15% for Ford. Whiston notes that tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico would violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement negotiated during Trump’s first term. But that can be reworked in July of 2026. Whiston said those tariffs would mean higher prices and many buyers already can’t afford the current average price of over $47,000. Trump also has threatened to get rid of electric vehicle tax credits that have helped boost sales of EVs. — Tom Krisher Bank stocks could benefit if Trump’s policies boost the U.S. economy and more customers apply for loans. In addition, Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo believes the Trump victory can usher in a “new era” of lighter financial regulation after 15 years of stricter oversight following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Under Biden, banks were facing requirements to set aside more capital to reduce risk, but the Trump administration is likely to take a step back. Dealmaking could see a revival under Trump, which would help banks with large investment banking operations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. That also increases the odds the pending merger between Capital One Financial and Discover Financial gets federal clearance. Regional banks should benefit if a growing economy prompts the creation of new small businesses or the expansion of existing ones. — Paul Harloff Construction companies are looking at a mixed bag, with lighter regulations a plus but higher materials costs a potential minus. Construction companies, including homebuilders KB Home and PulteGroup, could benefit from tax incentives and more friendly regulations. A surge in development could help relieve some pressure on a housing market pressured by a lack of supply for new homes. A boost in construction could also help suppliers of raw materials including steel and aggregates used in concrete. But the potential for overall raw material price increases is a threat. Higher costs could cut into profits for construction companies and homebuilders. Steel tariffs could help shield U.S. producers from competition, but a jump in global prices as a result could negate that benefit, while also squeezing construction companies. Plans for an immigration crackdown could worsen an existing labor shortage and result in delays for projects. — Damian Troise Trump, once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has surged above $86,000. Shares of crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 60% since the election. Crypto industry players welcomed Trump’s victory, in hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for. And Trump had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government’s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight. — Wyatte Grantham-Phillips Left: Photo by Andrew Kelly/ Reuters By Josh Boak, Associated Press By Seth Borenstein, Melina Walling, Associated Press By Haleluya Hadero, Associated Press By Seth Borenstein, Melina Walling, Sibi Arasu, Associated Press By Thomas Beaumont, Associated Press By Associated Press By Stan Choe, Associated Press Associated Press Associated Press Support Provided By: Learn more Support PBS News: Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.

After hitting record highs following Trump’s victory, the Dow and S&P 500 hit the brakes on Tuesday, a day before the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data. By the end of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 380 points, or 0.86%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 shed 0.29%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq also dropped 0.09%. Among tech stocks, Tesla (TSLA+2.13%) and Nvidia (NVDA-4.19%) rose over 3% and 2%, respectively, while Micron Technology (MU-2.85%) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.97%) declined by 5% and 4%. Bitcoin extended its rally after Trump’s win, nearing $90,000 between Monday night and early Tuesday. According to crypto tracking site Coingecko, the leading cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $89,864, bringing its market capitalization to $1.72 trillion — edging out silver’s $1.71 trillion but still far behind gold’s estimated $17.52 trillion. By Tuesday morning, however, Bitcoin had dropped back to around $86,000. A number of major players released their results before the opening bell, including Home Depot (HD+0.33%), the leading home improvement retailer, and AstraZeneca (AZN-2.32%), the multinational pharmaceutical company. Spotify (SPOT-3.46%), the music streaming giant, will report its earnings after the market close, along with MARA Holdings (MARA-3.37%), a key player in the cryptocurrency mining industry. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows By Ja'han Jones Welcome to the first post-election Tuesday Tech drop. Each Tuesday, I round up the last week’s top stories at the intersection of tech and politics. In my last Tech Drop, I warned how electing Donald Trump would risk accelerating the trend of wealthy elites consolidating their power over influential tech tools, including social media platforms, to divide Americans. Trump’s victory represents a major win for some of these very rich technocrats, and in the years ahead, it'll be incumbent upon us as users and consumers to guard against their efforts to weaponize technology against the vulnerable and amass power. Jack Teixeira, the Air National Guard member who leaked top secret Pentagon documents on the messaging platform Discord, was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Tuesday. Teixeira, who pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act, has been behind bars since his arrest last year. His release had been previously denied after authorities expressed concern that foreign governments could aid his escape and revealed he had a history of violent rhetoric, including a social media post in which he said he would like to “kill a ton of people.” Read more in Reuters. Now that Trump is president-elect, media outlets are focusing on his upcoming administration’s personnel. Ars Technica has a rundown on Brendan Carr, an FCC commissioner who’s seen as a potential pick to chair the commission. The profile highlights some of Carr’s MAGA bona fides, including his authorship of Project 2025’s section on the FCC, his contention that the government denying Elon Musk an $886 million contract was a politicized “punishment” and his objection to "Saturday Night Live" featuring Kamala Harris in a segment before the election. (NBC, which airs "SNL" and is also owned by MSNBC’s parent company, provided Trump with equal air time following a NASCAR race the next day.) Read more at Ars Technica. Silicon Valley tech leaders are openly fretting over how Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown could affect their workforce, particularly because many technology-related jobs in the U.S. are held by people on H1-B visas. Read more at Business Insider. Following Trump’s election win, I warned on the ReidOut blog about the wealthy Big Tech powerbrokers aligned with the Republican and how the online platforms they control helped to grease the skids for his return to the White House. Read the blog here. CNBC reports Elon Musk became $70 billion richer as a result of Trump’s election, primarily due to a spike in Tesla’s stock price. Seems like the decision to turn Twitter into a pro-Trump propaganda machine, at the cost of $44 billion, is netting out quite well for him. Read more at CNBC. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue released a report on the outburst of online misogyny targeting women since Trump’s election win. Some of that behavior includes men calling for “rape,” “rape squads” and targeting women with the phrase “your body, my choice.” Read my blog on the report here. A Michigan man who used Discord to prey on children was sentenced last week to 30 years in prison.

In response to pressure from the European Union over its use of targeted ads, Meta has proposed allowing Instagram and Facebook users to opt for “less personalized ads,” according to The Wall Street Journal.

Title: Trump’s Win Was Great for Stock Markets—but Not Everyone Saw a Boom

Although America’s CEOs and financiers largely condemned Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot in 2021, they all but made peace with his political return this year—tempering their onetime critiques of the candidate and the GOP, hedging their bets in the lead-up to Election Day, forbidding their media apparatuses from endorsing Kamala Harris, and lining up to kiss the ring soon after Trump’s win became clear. The money spoke, as it always does in U.S. elections, and the returns are pouring in for this newfound era of “Trump trades” that capitalize on democratic decline and power consolidation. After Trump’s victory speech, capitalism’s hype machines—with the notable exception of the bond markets—roared with approval. Every major traditional stock index surged to record heights after Election Day and has kept up the rally, so far. Cryptocurrencies are headed to the moon, as Bitcoin’s all-time-high valuations shower blessings upon the broader virtual-asset sector, and as Trump’s own crypto venture promises to launch its own dollar-backed stablecoin. That “digital gold” has triumphed over real gold, and the U.S. dollar remains as strong as ever. Meme stocks (like Trump’s own Truth Social) and memecoins (like Dogecoin, the favorite of one Elon Musk) keep going up, up, up; the WallStreetBets boys are having the time of their life. (Curiously, however, Trump-themed memecoins aren’t doing as hot.) And the “Magnificent Seven” Big Tech stocks that kept the markets aloft this year are celebrating. Indeed, the only thing left for traders to consider right now is whether they’re being too exuberant, and whether Trump will, you know, actually follow through on any of the things he said he’ll do. At least so far, the bonanza arises from several favorable factors for America’s private titans. Trump, of course, is as business-friendly as ever, welcoming all sorts of CEO advisers for his governmental transition. There are federal contract opportunities aplenty. The Federal Reserve is finally taking interest rates down bit by bit, adding some vigor to a sluggish investment environment. Moguls disaffected with the Biden administration’s antitrust philosophy and meager attempts at corporate tax increases are already hungry for lower taxes, slashed regulations, revolving-door Cabinet members, more mergers, and more acquisitions. Case in point: the leap in Live Nation’s investor confidence after its CFO expressed hope that the government’s antitrust lawsuit would be tossed out soon. (Sadly, despite the affection she curries among Vice President–elect J.D. Vance and his fellow “Khanservatives,” the aggressively pro-competition Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan is unlikely to last in her role. Remember, Trump’s anti-corporate actions in his first term were always more retaliatory than philosophical.) That doesn’t mean everyone’s a winner, though. Stocks for companies in industries that Trump has repeatedly attacked—renewable energy, vaccines—understandably sank. Shares for retailers in consumer goods (clothes, household appliances, etc.) and for real estate also settled a touch lower: The postelection dollar jump escalated mortgage rates, and executives in both sectors are worried about the impacts of mass deportation plans and hiked tariffs. (The inhumane immigration crackdown would have the side effect of draining the labor force; the increased tariffs would raise costs on imported materials.) Health care valuations in general underperformed in the markets, likely due to jitters around the future of Obamacare. Plus, oil and its manufacturers aren’t doing as great as you might think, even as their bets paid off on a president-elect who so directly demanded their dollars and loyalty. Of course, all of this is a crass exercise on the part of America’s financial class, a heaping sacrifice of vulnerable Americans and democratic bulwarks for the sake of “number go up.” Still, one thing that “Trump trades” can demonstrate is a map of reliable indicators of who wants (and expects) to profit from the return of this insurrectionist maniac, as well as whether they’ll find themselves sunk in the longer term when Trump’s loyal advisory team once again does something economically heartless and stupid. These are the public companies to keep watch over throughout the next few years, the biggest Trump bettors that will soon find out whether “doing business with Hitler” was worth it after all: The cryptocurrency industry spent so much money in this race that they’ve all but bribed and ensured future loyalty from a bipartisan swath of lawmakers. Trump himself was quite attentive to “your Bitcoin, your crypto, and everything else that you’re playing with” this election cycle: speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, launching his own NFT “trading cards,” and even helming his own flopping crypto trading business, World Liberty Financial. More importantly, there’s the inevitability that Trump and a paid-off Congress will shove aside the Biden era’s aggressive regulators, like Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, and allow the digital assets sector to freely prey on more retail investors and promulgate more scams. Here are the funny-money investors who have arguably benefited the most so far: Microstrategy: The Bitcoin software company also got a nice postelection bump, with Trump’s victory leading its key currency to never-before-seen thresholds. To celebrate, Microstrategy made its largest Bitcoin purchase since 2020, scooping up about $2 billion worth of that digital gold and announcing a massive new fundraising round. Nvidia: Energy-intensive Bitcoin mining requires the types of processors that Nvidia has specialized in from the beginning—an early specialty that’s helped it to become a multitrillion-dollar company in the age of energy-intensive A.I. training. So the processing unit manufacturer has a lot to look forward to. Coinbase: CEO Brian Armstrong was the single most significant organizer (and funder) of the 2024 election cycle’s crypto lobby, and his publicly traded digital exchange—which also holds a federal contract with the U.S. Marshals and is also fending off an SEC suit that would require most crypto tokens to be registered as securities—has enjoyed a nice postelection surge. Speaking of supporters who stand to profit … Tesla: CEO Elon Musk’s role as campaign surrogate and likely government adviser gave his biggest company a fiery boost from investors, and his already sky-high net worth ballooned as a result. (Tesla stock remains the primary driver of his wealth.) No, it doesn’t matter that Trump doesn’t care for electric vehicles or charging stations; Tesla is already pivoting toward robots and sure-to-be-faulty robotaxis. Bonus: Tesla, along with Musk ventures like SpaceX, likely won’t have those pesky federal rules and regulations and unions to deal with. (Not to mention, those federal lawsuits over racism at Tesla’s workplaces.) Big banks: Bank stocks are back up, baby. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon kept mum about the race except to vaguely claim that Trump was “kind of right” about certain issues; the stock is doing great. Back in October, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley executives salivated over the possibility of increased corporate consolidations throughout 2025; their investors are also ready to take that bet, post-Biden. The CEOs of Citi and Bank of America both met with Trump in June; the former, at least, is ready for Trump to cease the government’s regulatory scrapes with Citigroup. So are investors. (Worth noting: Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were also among the seven banks that helped finance $13 billion of Musk’s $44 billion Twitter takeover.) Energy Transfer: The CEO of the firm behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline poured $5.8 million into Trump’s campaign and is likely to reap the benefits from the fossil-fuel-loving, environment-hating president. Investors certainly believe so. Palantir: The generous provider of A.I. surveillance tech, military intelligence services, and data analysis tech is operated by one of Trump’s biggest fans (chairman Peter Thiel), so investors are expecting even more federal partnerships to come. Even though CEO Alex Karp backed Kamala Harris, he’s mad enough about campus protesters—and content enough with the coming contract opportunities—that he probably isn’t too bothered by Trump’s win. Joe Lonsdale, a Palantir co-founder and financial backer of conservative causes, is definitely happy all around. It’s not just defense interests looking forward to what spoils Trump may bring. Private prisons: Barack Obama vowed to phase out private prisons during his presidency, so of course the incarceration business celebrated when Trump first won in 2016 and Attorney General Jeff Sessions reversed course. Operators like Geo Group and CoreCivic have had even more to celebrate this round, as Trump’s mass deportation plans will likely help to fill their cells; their stocks were thrilled by the president-elect’s announcement that he would appoint former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan, known to be the “father” of Trump’s family separation policy, as the incoming administration’s “border czar.” (By Monday, both companies’ stocks were up 75 percent from Election Day levels.) Axon Enterprise: The tech business formerly known as Taser International—yes, as in that type of Taser—saw a big jump after Election Day, thanks to likely accurate perceptions that Trump will continue to militarize our police forces (and also deputize local forces to help round up immigrants). Immigrants, both legal and “illegal,” are some of the biggest contributors to American prosperity and world standing, but look, there are folks who stand to profit from their persecution. Racial capitalism wins again. Perhaps most depressingly, what all these “Trump trades” show is that there is nothing too extreme for America’s plutocrats to abide—not an attempted coup, not open bigotry and baseless fearmongering, not convictions of sexual abuse, not even the country’s perceptions around the world. The “free market” was never going to preserve democracy. Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time.

By Lambert Strether of Corrente. Bird Song of the Day Northern Mockingbird, Granville Schools Land Lab, Licking, Ohio, United States. “Song.” * * * In Case You Might Miss… * * * Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Transition “Axelrod: Second Trump administration has ‘wholly different feel'” [The Hill]. “‘Say what you will about the direction he wants to take the country but this is a wholly different feel from 2016. Trump is stocking his admin with seasoned loyalists who will not guide, but rather BE guided, by HIM,’ Axelrod posted to the social platform X. ‘People wanted to shake up Washington. For better or worse, they’re [going] to get what they asked for,’ he said.” • The difficulty that administrations have is that they have to administer, and to do that, they need administrators. How many heterodox policy experts are there who actually know where the levers of power are? Commentary: Tucker's very public campaign to get Trump to hire heterodox people seems to be losing to Trump's very public desire for the GOP to like him, a lot of safe picks, so far no wildcards. — Zaid Jilani (@ZaidJilani) November 12, 2024 2024 Post Mortem From a Republican pollster, but AP Votecast data: The rundown of which groups swung right & didn't looks like an intersectional layercake of oppression. 😂 Old, white, married, educated people hold steady, young, nonwhite, single, and non-college educated people zoom right. pic.twitter.com/MU1u0RPDEj — Patrick Ruffini (@PatrickRuffini) November 12, 2024 So, a change election after all. “Exit Right” [Gabriel Winant, Dissent]. “Just as in 2016, Harris supporters have fallen back on the racism and sexism of American society as an explanation for defeat. No doubt these are hulking obstacles, but they don’t suffice as omnibus explanation…. [But] these are not static phenomena. Trump mobilizes these forces; the task of his opponent is to countermobilize and defeat them. A successful campaign draws on the material of the existing society and assembles it into a portrait of the present and a vision of the future: it does not simply reflect frozen facts of public opinion and common sense but reorganizes them and ultimately produces new forms.” And: “The pathologies of the Democrats, though, are in a sense not the result of errors. It is the structural role and composition of the party that produces its duplicitous and incoherent orientation. It is the mainstream party of globalized neoliberal capitalism, and at the same time, by tradition anyway, the party of the working class. As the organized power of the latter has been washed away, the commitment has become somewhat more aspirational: Harris notably cleaned up with the richest income bracket of voters.” And finally: “The demobilization of the Democratic electorate is thus the product of the party’s contradictory character at more than one level. The accountability of the Democrats to antagonistic constituencies produces both rhetorical incoherence—what does this party stand for?—and programmatic self-cancellation. Champions of the domestic rule of law and the rules-based international order, they engaged in a spectacular series of violations of domestic and international law. Promising a new New Deal, they admonished voters to be grateful for how well they were already doing economically. Each step taken by the party’s policymakers in pursuit of one goal imposes a limit in another direction. It is by this dynamic that a decade of (appropriate) anti-Trump hysteria led first to the adoption of parts of Trump’s program by the Democrats, and then finally his reinstallation as president at new heights of public opinion favorability. Nothing better than the real thing.” • With “globalized neoliberal capitalism,” Winant focuses on ideology, not class (i.e., the Democrat base in the PMC). Still, worth reading in full. * * * Deploy the Blame Cannons! Lambert here: In general, the lastest barrages of blame cannonry are better written than the previous hot take emisisons, not sure why. More to come! “Kamala Fell to the Same Cabal That Destroyed University Presidents” [Maureen Tkacik, The American Prospect]. “Time was you had Democrat billionaires, Republican billionaires, and opportunistic bipartisan billionaires. Republicans had the resource extraction guys and the Waltons and anyone who employed enough workers that they needed to bust unions; Democrats had Hollywood and Big Tech; both parties had joint custody of Wall Street. And the billionaires got what they wanted 99.9 percent of the time. This election was different. For all the venal raves the media bestowed upon Kamala Harris’s fundraising prowess, the whales near-universally lined up behind Trump. Of the top ten mega-donors, only the bottom two gave to Democrats; Trump’s haul from his own top ten donors—none of whom boasts the surname Koch or Thiel—amounted to about $945 million; Harris’s topped out at $254 million. (Harris ended up raising more money, thanks to Resistance giving, but Trump got to spend much less time raising it, and with Musk, he had the algorithms on his side.)” And: “At its heart, the billionaire revolt was the expression of a broader dissatisfaction with Joe Biden that was most surely rooted in the real, substantial, and (in the post–Cold War neoliberal era) unprecedented things his administration was quietly (too quietly!) doing for working people, small-business owners, and the proliferating subsistence entrepreneur class that falls somewhere in the middle. It sued Amazon for squeezing sellers to the bone while manipulating prices ever higher, Albertsons and Kroger for conspiring to gouge shoppers by littering the country with dead strip centers where supermarkets once stood, Live Nation for indenturing a generation of young musicians and turning tickets to concerts and sports events into luxury goods, Welsh Carson (the most powerful private equity firm in health care) for gouging hospital patients and suppressing the wages of anesthesiologists in multiple states, and more. It even got a court to label Google a monopolist. This stuff was extremely popular, and Democratic leaders never talked about it, likely because it pissed off the donor class—which is of course the very reason they should have been talking about nothing else.” And: “In any event, though, the billionaires weaponized toxic wokeness to make themselves seem more receptive and in touch with Normal Dudes than the Democrats, who unbeknownst to most Normal Dudes had actually been working tirelessly on behalf of the common man while Joe Biden was preoccupied wringing his hands over why Bibi was being so mean to him.” • I like this piece a lot, but I’m not sure how much I buy “working tirelessly on behalf of the common man,” since I think it proceeds from the very, very low baseline set by Obama. I would never trash the efforts of the Lina Khan and the anti-trusters; they are tireless, but the Democrat Party as a whole? The successful deep-sixing of a million disproportionately working class deaths from Covid tells the tale. “Kamala Harris ran the Fyre Festival of campaigns” [The Spectator]. “As the finger-pointing begins, and the autopsy of the Kamala Harris campaign continues, financial details are being released on how the Harris campaign managed to blow more than $1 billion in war-chest funds — and not only lose, but get wiped off the electoral map by Donald Trump, who ended his campaign with roughly $488 million. That’s not a Dr. Evil typo: Kamala Harris not only blew a billion dollars, but actually ended up $20 million in debt. Where did the money all go? To celebrities mostly, and elaborate sets and stages. As it turns out, not all of those celebrity “activists” appeared with Kamala Harris because they believed in her or were doing their civic duty by getting engaged. They charged fees — and some were astronomical. Harris made elaborate promises to her crowds about celebrity performances. Crowds were brought in with the promise of seeing Beyoncé perform, only to leave disappointed. It was all a financial ruse, much like the infamous Fyre Festival of 2017… the Harris campaign spent upwards of six figures to build a custom set for her appearance on the Call Me Daddy podcast, which only netted about 800,000 downloads. Meanwhile, Donald Trump appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast — and his interview has got more than 47 million views on YouTube. There were seven swing-state concerts that involved high-priced performers — Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Jon Bon Jovi, Ricky Martin and more — who seemingly ended up costing the Harris campaign more than $20 million on event production alone, and reportedly even more on paying the celebrities to appear. Even Oprah Winfrey charged the campaign $1 million to show up. The campaign went so far into debt that the campaign was reportedly forced to scrap Canadian Nineties indie-pop singer Alanis Morissette to save money. The pop concert campaign strategy is said to have been the brainchild of former Obama advisors on the campaign.” • Ironic [chortles]. “Is said to have been” by whom? * * * “Why Was There a Broad Drop-Off in Democratic Turnout in 2024?” [New York Times]. “Mr. Trump won the White House not only because he turned out his supporters and persuaded skeptics, but also because many Democrats sat this election out, presumably turned off by both candidates. Counties with the biggest Democratic victories in 2020 delivered 1.9 million fewer votes for Ms. Harris than they had for Mr. Biden. The nation’s most Republican-heavy counties turned out an additional 1.2 million votes for Mr. Trump this year, according to the analysis of the 47 states where the vote count is largely complete. The drop-off spanned demographics and economics. It was clear in counties with the highest job growth rates, counties with the most job losses and counties with the highest percentage of college-educated voters. Turnout was down, too, across groups that are traditionally strong for Democrats — including areas with large numbers of Black Christians and Jewish voters. The decline in key cities, including Detroit and Philadelphia, made it exceptionally difficult for Ms. Harris to win the battlegrounds of Michigan and Pennsylvania.” And: In Pennsylvania, the biggest electoral prize on the battleground map, Mr. Trump’s victory received an outsize boost from an unlikely place — the five counties with the highest percentage of registered Democrats: Allegheny, Delaware, Lackawanna, Montgomery and Philadelphia. Ms. Harris won these counties, but not by the margins needed to overcome Republican-heavy areas of the state. Total turnout was down from 2020 in all five Democratic strongholds, which could partly explain how Ms. Harris received 78,000 fewer votes than Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump added 24,000 votes to his total in these same counties. Holy moley! And it’s the same story in other swing states. What a debacle. “The common national experience that explains Trump’s 2024 gains” [Ronald Brownstein, CNN]. “But the scale of Trump’s advance this year points toward a common national experience in all regions of the country — a shared disappointment in the results generated by President Joe Biden’s administration…. But since then, [UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavrec] said, the similarly uniform shift away from Trump in 2020 — and then back toward him in 2024 — points toward voter assessments of performance, rather than big further ideological shifts, as the main driver of the results. Just as Trump, as the incumbent, suffered from a negative verdict on his performance in 2020, Harris, as the quasi-incumbent successor to Biden, suffered from a negative verdict on the president’s performance four years later.” • Throw the bums out! “In the Race for the Presidency, GOP Turnout Declined, Democratic Turnout Collapsed” [Daily Yonder]. “Donald Trump won the popular vote and the presidency by getting nearly as many votes this year as he did in 2020, while Democratic turnout – especially in major cities – collapsed, a Daily Yonder analysis of preliminary election returns shows. Kamala Harris got 12 million fewer votes than Joe Biden did in 2020, a decline of 15%, according to a preliminary analysis of 46 states. Trump, meanwhile, lost only 1 million votes, compared to his 2020 returns, a decline of less than 2%.” • Handy chart, broken down by county type: * * * “Even Fox News Saw a Close 2024 Election. Then the Voting Data Came In” [Variety]. “‘At 5 p.m., the most likely outcome was a very close election,’ says Arnon Mishkin, who has directed Fox News’ decision desk for years. ‘Different people looked at the data and said this could tilt Trump and this could tilt Harris.’ Within hours, however, a different story was unspooling — and viewers of Fox News were early to hear it being told. Fox News was able to call many states earlier than many of its competitors, including a critical loss by the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania in the wee hours of the morning that largely decided the race in favor of Trump.How so? The company made a big investment in new voter technology last decade that relies less on exit polls, and more on on-the-ground data from each state.” • I ran into a similar problem in my own (not to be pompous) methodology; I didn’t prepare readers for the scope of Trump’s victory, e.g. winning all swing states. I wrote that up yesterday, but started with a metaphor about the death of Saruman, which I butchered, out of haste. I have since corrected it, and readers who were justifibly confused can read what I meant to say here (which I feel is important or I wouldn’t be harping on it). * * * “Judge delays Trump immunity decision in NY hush money case” [The Hill]. “A New York judge delayed a Tuesday decision on whether President-elect Trump’s conviction can withstand the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling, following his election victory last week. Judge Juan Merchan agreed to freeze the case until Nov. 19, newly public court records show, enabling prosecutors to respond to Trump’s demand the case be dismissed entirely now that he is president-elect. Trump’s sentencing, which would be the first of any former president, is scheduled for Nov. 26. He was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment made to porn actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election to conceal an affair, which he denies. Trump’s attorneys believe his election as president compels the dismissal of his criminal prosecutions. ‘The stay, and dismissal, are necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump’s ability to govern,’ Trump attorney Emil Bove wrote in an email to the judge.” • Maybe Trump could make a short jail stay work for him, carrying on the stellar work he did at McDonald’s and driving the garbage truck. Merchan could send him to jail for a day, to underline respect for the process blah blah blah, and Trump would enter Rikers — in an orange jumpsuit, naturally — to a cheering throng of inmates and guards, and then Merchan could put him on probation, and everybody could stand down and forget about this farrago of bad law and political prosecution. Democrats en Déshabillé “The model exactly predicted the most likely election map” [Nate Silver]. But that’s not the interesting part. In a footnote: “I essentially got to perform a randomized control trial on how partisans in both camps reacted to good and bad news. And there was an asymmetry. Republicans are generally happy when you agree with them partway or half the time. Admittedly, the sorts of Republicans who encounter our work are not a representative sample, probably being on the moderate side — though you can find plenty of Trump supporters in the Silver Bulletin comments section. Democrats, however — and here, I’m not referring so much to Silver Bulletin subscribers but in the broader universe online — often get angry with you when you only halfway agree with them. And I really think this difference in personality profiles tells you a little something about why Trump won: Trump was happy to take on all comers, whereas with Democrats, disagreement on any hot-button topic (say, COVID school closures or Biden’s age) will have you cast out as a heretic. That’s not a good way to build a majority, and now Democrats no longer have one.” • Democrats, as we would expect, are doubling down on this behavior: There’s a concerted effort to move high(er)-traffic accounts off Twitter onto Blue Sky, as if the world needed more Democrat embubblement than it already has. Further, for all its many faults, Elon Musk’s hell-site still has a very functional Covid-conscious community, which these trolls would end up splitting, not that such a thing would matter to them. Brunch at Blue Sky! “The US Is a Civic Desert. To Survive, the Democratic Party Needs to Transform Itself.” [Pete Davis, The Nation]. The deck: “The party should jettison its consultant class and move toward a local-membership model that would help to rejuvenate civic life across the country.” More: “Here’s one sketch of how we could begin to turn this around: The 4 Ms of party membership, each symbolic of a necessary mindset shift. First, Membership Cards. When you join the Labour Party in Britain, you get mailed a welcome packet, complete with a membership card and information about how to get more involved. The Democratic Party could learn from this: It should mean something to join the Democrats. … Second, Maps. There should be an accountable Democratic captain for every neighborhood in the country…. Third, Meeting Halls. Monthly meetings should be designed with utmost care. Best practices for making meetings, working groups, and annual calendars warm and engaging should be gathered and disseminated. Formal rules and procedures should not be fetishized at the expense of engaging new members. … Finally, Mutual Aid. The party should directly care for members and for the broader community. Democrats should do disaster relief, take on homeless-shelter shifts, cook food when members have a baby, welcome new immigrants to town, and host block parties throughout the year. … This is all easier dreamed than realized.

They have a fancy new machine: “We describe a novel biosafety aerosol chamber equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation for bubble-bursting aerosol generation, size distribution measurement, and condensation-growth collection to minimize sampling artifacts when measuring virus infectivity in aerosol particles.” Interestingly: “Despite decades of research, there remains great difficulty in identifying and understanding the factors that control the spread of influenza epidemics, which occur each year in both hemispheres. In this study, we aimed to simulate exhalation, airborne residence, and re-inhalation of IAV-containing particles as accurately as possible. As an initial step, we specifically used purely saline aerosol particles to avoid the complexity of natural matrices. We revealed large discrepancies between aerosol-borne viruses and previous microliter droplet experiments performed with similar matrices. The discrepancies between aerosol and deposited droplet experiments need to be explained in order to obtain a reliable model for aerosol transmission.” • Thanks, droplet dogmatists.

Blood samples taken from 115 farm workers in Michigan and Colorado over the summer found evidence of a recent infection in eight individuals — half of whom recalled being ill around the same time the cows were sick. The other half could not recall having any symptoms.” Serological surveys. More: “In response to the new data, the CDC is now recommending that any farm workers who were exposed to infected animals be tested for H5N1, whether or not they have symptoms. Previously, the agency advised that only individuals who had been exposed and had symptoms be tested. The purpose of this expansion is to intensify case-finding efforts, so that even workers with mild or unnoticeable infections can be offered treatment and isolation. The CDC is also recommending that Tamiflu be offered to any individuals on a farm with infected animals who’ve had a high-risk exposure — like being splashed with milk from a dairy cow or participating in a culling operation on a poultry farm — without adequate personal protective equipment. The CDC’s study found that all eight people with H5N1 antibodies had reported cleaning milking parlors, and most reported milking cows. None of them reported wearing respiratory protection and fewer than half wore eye protection.” Elite Maleficence “ASHRAE Standard 62: tobacco industry’s influence over national ventilation standards” [Tobacco Control].

Hospitals in the US were effectively relieved of their obligations to provide high-quality pandemic-era care when pay-for-performance programs, rankings, and ratings excluded months of pandemic-era data from their method. Though ostensibly made with benign intent, these decisions to exclude pandemic-era quality-reporting data were not patient centered and may not have been methodologically necessary. The findings of Metersky et al demonstrate that quality and safety data are needed more than ever during times of crisis. This would allow patients and payers to understand which hospitals have resilient systems in order to make informed decisions about where they choose to receive and fund health care.” Fortunately: “With hospital-specific COVID-19 admissions data from HHS coupled with patient-level Medicare or other electronic health record or claims data, it is still possible to recreate the unreported pandemic-era quality outcomes benchmarks to identify resilient hospitals, systems, and processes during surge capacity. In fact, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ FY 2025 Inpatient Prospective Payment System Proposed Rule will extend the COVID-19 admissions data to include data for all respiratory illnesses.” IPC = Infection Prevention and Control.

They even have a name, “no-comp[etition] or low-comp[etition] zones,” according to one executive on the stand. Of course that makes sense, we’d expect firms to maximize profits where they can. One might be tempted to say, well, there are some towns that can’t support more than one store. And that might be true, except that there are several examples of supermarket chains using tactics in such towns to thwart the opening of competition. How? Well, they find a way to dominate the existing plots of land and buildings suitable for such a store. In June, for instance, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who is also litigating against the merger, fined Albertsons $25,000 for imposing a land use restriction on a store it sold in 2018 in a low-income section of Bellingham, Washington. As part of the sale, the supermarket giant put a requirement on the deed that no grocery store could open there until 2038. Ferguson found this provision was a violation of the state antitrust law. These kinds of land use restrictions are likely common. A few months ago, I got an email from an economist focused on rural areas, who explained how Albertsons abuses its market power in a series of small skiing towns in rural California using a similar strategy.” Manufacturing: “Boeing reaches settlement to avert civil trial in 2019 Max crash” [Straits Times]. “The crash of the Ethiopian Airlines plane killed 157 people. The trial was set to begin on Nov 12 in Chicago. It originally involved six plaintiffs but until now all but one had settled, according to a source familiar with the case. The hearing on Nov 12 will take place to inform Judge Jorge Alonso of the settlement, who must approve the deal for it to be officially settled, the source said. ‘It is a damage-only trial, meaning no evidence regarding the liability of Boeing will be presented,’ the source told AFP.” • Too bad. Manufacturing: “Boeing Got The Easy Part Done. Now Comes The Tougher, Existential Problems” [Seattle Medium]. “Boeing is America’s largest exporter, and therefore very exposed to any trade war. China is the largest global market for new aircraft purchases, with Boeing forecasting that China’s fleet of commercial jets will double in the next 20 years. The aircraft maker has been down this road before. The company’s sales to China ground to a near-halt in 2017 as trade tensions between the two countries escalated during Trump’s first term. Orders from Chinese buyers fell from 64 in 2016 to 51 in 2017 to zero in both 2018 and 2019. A similar drop could occur if a new trade war breaks out. ‘We really don’t know what Trump will do with Chinese tariffs,’ said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an industry consultant. ‘But if he slaps 60% tariffs on all Chinese goods, the quickest way for China to retaliate is to switch to (Boeing rival) Airbus for 100% of its needs.’ Boeing has seen a modest resumption of sales and deliveries to China recently, with 20 orders in 2021 and 15 in 2023. So far this year it has 53 deliveries to China, up from 35 in the four previous years combined.” Manufacturing: “Employees across Boeing face sweeping layoffs this week” [Seattle Times]. “Boeing employees will learn Wednesday who will lose their jobs in mid-January in the round of layoffs Boeing announced last month. The cuts will be broadly spread across the company and, despite some expectations earlier, engineers and production workers won’t be exempt…. But a Boeing senior engineering manager in St. Louis said the cuts in the works target a roughly 10% reduction across the engineers supporting military programs, including the F-15 and F/A-18 jet fighters and the Navy’s P-8 submarine hunter, which is built in Renton with military systems installed in Seattle. Those engineering organizations will shrink, said the manager, who asked not to be identified to protect his job. “If the idea in Kelly’s mind is cutting overhead and programs will not be impacted, that’s not what’s happening.’…. Still, it’s clear non-front-line positions will suffer bigger losses. And white-collar staff working remotely may be particularly targeted as Ortberg tries to get the workforce connected and aligned with his new direction. A manager of a small team of about 15 people, all working remotely — and ironically focused on ways to improve efficiency in program management — told one employee to expect a 30% cut in his team. ‘If we are not holding a wrench, if we’re considered overhead, it’s about 30%,’ said the employee, who also asked not to be identified to protect his job.

Photo Book “Leaving and Waving” [Deanna Dikeman]. “For 27 years, I took photographs as I waved good-bye and drove away from visiting my parents at their home in Sioux City, Iowa. I started in 1991 with a quick snapshot, and I continued taking photographs with each departure. I never set out to make this series. I just took these photographs as a way to deal with the sadness of leaving. It gradually turned into our good-bye ritual. And it seemed natural to keep the camera busy, because I had been taking pictures every day while I was there. These photographs are part of a larger body of work I call Relative Moments, which has chronicled the lives of my parents and other relatives since 1986. When I discovered the series of accumulated “leaving and waving” photographs, I found a story about family, aging, and the sorrow of saying good-bye. In 2009, there is a photograph where my father is no longer there. He passed away a few days after his 91st birthday. My mother continued to wave good-bye to me. Her face became more forlorn with my departures. In 2017, my mother had to move to assisted living. For a few months, I photographed the good-byes from her apartment door. In October of 2017 she passed away. When I left after her funeral, I took one more photograph, of the empty driveway. For the first time in my life, no one was waving back at me.” Zeitgeist Watch “Why Close Reading is An Essential Part of Literary Translation” [Literary Hub]. “Reading—’this fruitful miracle of communication in the bosom of solitude,’ as Proust called it in a translator’s preface— is miraculously and mysteriously neither objective nor subjective, neither purely taking something in nor purely revealing or expressing what’s inside oneself. It is a complex interplay of the self and the world, analogous to perception—we see what’s really there in the world, but we see it, and it’s there in our world, the environment we move in and care about, which is different from the environment of any other person or animal in the same physical space.” • Take that, influencers! Class Warfare “The ‘Happiness Plateau’ Doesn’t Exist” [Bloomberg]. “[T]he latest academic work chips away at the idea that there is a plateau, just as previous academic work chipped away at the idea of happy peasants and miserable bourgeois. Matthew Killingsworth, of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Business School, has amassed a sample of more than one million real-time reports of experienced well-being in the US (compiled by getting people to report their day-to-day well-being on their smartphones). In a 2021 paper he studied 33,000 people who provided such real-time evidence and discovered three things: that there is no evidence of a divergence between evaluative and real-time well-being; that real-time well-being rises linearly with income and, third, that the slope is just as steep above $80,000 a year as below. The idea of a happiness plateau is for the birds: Higher incomes are clearly associated with both feeling better on a day-to-day basis and being more satisfied with your life overall. What about people who earn well above $80,000? In a new paper Killingsworth compares the reported life-satisfaction of his sample of 33,000 Americans with a wide variety of incomes with the reported life-satisfaction of two groups of ultra-wealthy individuals: millionaires from around the world and members of the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. His conclusions are well-summarized in the title of his study: ‘Money and Happiness: Extended Evidence against Satiation.’ Truly wealthy people are significantly happier than the highest earners in the ordinary income group if you take ‘life satisfaction’ as a meaningful measure of happiness. Moreover, the happiness gap between truly wealthy people and middle-income earners is three times as large as the happiness gap between middle and low-income groups. We not only get happier as we move from the middle-income herd to the Succession crowd, but we get a lot happier. Killingsworth’s study is not perfect: There is such a shortage of evidence about the well-being of the truly wealthy that one of the studies he relies on, of the Forbes 400, dates from 1985 (the other is from 2018). But never has the phrase ‘more research is required’ sounded more attractive.” • If there were in fact a happiness plateau, would there not also tend to be a capital accumulation plateau for capitalist owners? There doesn’t seem to be.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Remember the last week – and the FEMA employee directing the Milton response team to avoid Florida homes that got overlooked. Things just got a lot more interesting……. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5SP0jIZPs0 The fired employee is refusing to go under the bus calmly. I would possibly call her a whistleblower. It appears she was following orders from headquarters – and this was also happening in NC and other places. Hoo Boy! All those silent Trump voters lying to pollsters and the dearth of Trump signs in yards – the MAGA crowd may have more IQ than the PMC think. Again, who am I going to believe – the employee under the bus OR yet another branch of this Administration and the lapdog national media who seem to lie about almost everything. Thanks very much for the link Doc. It gives good information about the FEMA process. This whole program is 2 1/2 hours but the interview starts at 10 minutes in. The phrase or term “hostile work environment” seems overly broad, much like claims of “micro aggressions” have been used in the past as a weapon against others. Granted, if someone is pointing a gun at you, that is a reason to leave, but abandoning neighborhoods merely because some people are acting emotionally after a natural disaster is bad. And there is a question I really want the answer to….. Did all of these celebrities like Bon Jovi and Springsteen and Oprah charge the Obama campaign and the Biden campaign the same millions or is this something new? Because if they did not, it appears to me that the Kamala campaign may have been one of the largest money-laundering schemes in history. This really needs to be investigated. Is it against the law for celebrities like Oprah to appear and say nothing publicly about it being paid, and then take what seems to be obscene amounts under the table? It’s OK when they do it. That is another aspect of campaign spending that sorely needs to be addressed: any entity getting more than (picking a random reasonable number) $10,000 has to list all of its owners, unless it’s a publicly traded company. No more hiding behind LLCs. Someone(s) in the consultant class are sobbing all the way back home while counting their cash—-while I imagine some small-time bakery gets stiffed and becomes one of the creditors holding the Harris campaign’s $20 million bag. > No more hiding behind I still insist that in 2020, after being stabbed in the back by the Democrats, Sanders should have pivoted to riding the wave of labor organizing that was rising at the same time the pandemic was. I think he could have made the case to his base, and his base would have accepted it, particularly with a focus on protecting the working class from the ravages of Covid in the workplace. As it is… I won’t say that the well for a Sanders-style campaign based entirely on small donations has been poisoned irretrievably, given how horrid the current system is, but honestly, what did people get? (Perhaps the small donor concept should be redirected to an institution, more or less permanent, as opposed to a campaign, temporary by definition). I have trouble seeing why that’d be against any law. If Obama can charge millions in speaking fees for showing up at corporate and other hubbubs, why not? (I have to imagine Obama had to go bona fide for political campaigns, but that’s sort of his job as a Dem insider, but talking politics is not Oprah’s or Beyonce’s job. Um, maybe you missed this, but this is from when Stephen Colbert was a “better” comedian. In this clip he starts a super PAC, and can take any and all amounts of money from corporations: Comedy Central’s “Colbert Super PAC” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijxvjL7KJlk The lawyer helping him is pretty much the guy that wrote the law. Later on, Stephen signs a few more forms with the same lawyer (after the election) and all the remaining super PAC money becomes his money (there might be a few shell corporations in this). All entirely legal, has been for years. (I’m looking for that clip – I think it’s been scrubbed out of existence.) Haven’t you ever wondered where all the money goes AFTER the election, or why elections seem to cost more and more? Here’s the shell corporation: Comedy Central’s “Colbert Super PAC”: Stephen’s Shell Corporation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXOeChlhbhg And here’s the whole saga. Now what they gloss over in this by saying “he donated the money to charity” is that it was HIS MONEY TO GIVE at the end: Stephen Colbert’s Super PAC Lessons | Long Story Short | NBC News https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy7TUtlPmqk I still cannot find the clips where he signed a couple forms and the money was his – I should have save that. For all we know, the first time Trump ran it was just for the PR, and the MONEY. I’m not sure he expected to win. Just a little coda – because I’m not trying to belittle Trump – like him or not, he is now a giant in American politics, and good for him. I think Trump’s 2016 election was about an American public that was thoroughly disgusted with the corruption that Colbert demonstrated in both parties (the uniparty). The American public is not dumb, and they are very tired of getting screwed, so Trump, who was pretty straight forward about calling out the corruption, won. i agree with all you said….i remember trump at 3am or whatever(2016) with a real, authentic* ‘i caught the car’ look. he wanted his narcissistic supply, and got it…but then was expected to govern? pure dying empire mode,lol. (* you could tell it was authentic because, altho i never paid him much mind, he was ubiquitous, and was never, in my mind, to be associated with that word…i could almost see the cartoon thoughtbubble:”oh shit”) If you look at presidential elections over the past 30 years the winners oscillate between Democrats and Republicans. The electorate keeps hoping against hope that things will change, but they never do. Trump will prove to be a disappointment and so a Democrat will likely be elected POTUS in 2028. And the beat goes on. > Trump, who was pretty straight forward about calling out the corruption, won. This from Dave Chappelle is a hardy perennial, and not wrong: Won’t you come and join the Party Commentary on “Not Like Us” (a “Diss Track”). Drake is bad Is that bad good or bad bad? I’d like to know this too. I thought I was cynical enough and informed enough that nothing would surprise me. But hearing celebs were paid to endorse Harris actually has me a little surprised. I could see if it was pay for a performance, but Beyonce getting $10mil to come out and say “vote for Kamala” is nuts! I can’t believe there isn’t a disclosure requirement. Well, this is ‘Merica…I guess I can. Also, great to see the numbers. I remember all the crowing about how much they were raising. Didn’t do squat for ’em. Just like Hillary 2016. Heh. Never heard of paying celebrity endorsers but I’m too old to understand modern politics. This is strongly suggestive of Hollywood having a business relationship with, if not the Democrats then with the people the Democrats report to. When I worked with the Kennedy in ’80 campaign it was a no-brainer to give the “driving Sally Field” gig to one of our female union stewards that we’d been trying to talk into joining our local’s COPE committee. That was 1980 and the use of celebrity surrogates was somewhat edgy but Norma Rae was a popular movie and Field was on board. To the absolute best of my knowledge Field did this at her own expense and our driver did not get paid by the union or the factory although Field probably thought that was the case. Everyone always assumed you were getting paid if you took time off work for a campaign. Can’t cite the rules but that was a no-no. Not only do high level volunteers do so without pay, they usually do so at significant personal cost to themselves. If they have money, they donate both time and money to the campaign. And they don’t talk about that because no one needs to know those things. When you’re not being paid, it empowers you to, well, take my word for it — it empowers you. The current “everyone must get paid” bull excrement was put in place as part of a manufacturered higher wages for campaign workers movement that’s less than a decade old and which was created to push volunteers (witnesses) out of campaign spaces. Raising pay made the jobs more valuable and instead of selectively recruiting staff from existing experienced former staff/volunteers, the party and the various campaigns started doing crony hires. If I have a problem with 2020 vote tallies, it’s because I know for a fact that the Democrat party lacked the qualified staff to pull off a massive ballot harvest. My guess would be that countless NGOs used staff interfacing with poors to provide contracted for services plus help with filling out and casting ballots. It’s all — in my opinion — crooked as hell but when you don’t know how to win elections, cheating probably seems like the best option. > If I have a problem with 2020 vote tallies, it’s because I know for a fact that the Democrat party lacked the qualified staff to pull off a massive ballot harvest.

Interesting hypothesis (and akin to the role NGOs play in placing migrants, as contractors, entirely under the radar). And not, naturally, covered at all, the NGOsphere being a pillar of the Democrat Party, not to mention Little Madison’s workplace after Oberlin. This is an evolving story. Unsurprisingly it is being picked up on all right wing news and related websites and they may be stretching things quite a bit. Still, even the Washington Examiner is quoting FEC filings reporting that the Harris campaign gave $1 million to Harpo Productions (Oprah’s company). Oprah has publicly stated that doesn’t mean she was paid $1 million. Right. Of course not. Regular people understand how someone paying the company you own and profit from doesn’t mean you were paid… Of the amounts people are pulling from FEC filings appears to be production related expenses for various Ms. Harris’ appearance. For example, on the Call Her Daddy podcast. Those expenses are allegedly related to a $6 million payment for a mediocre looking set. Donors have every right to be furious about this. $6 million spent to help down ballot candidates could have dramatically altered a lot of contests. Pretty sure Trump didn’t have to pay the Podcasters he visited to speak on their shows. Pretty sure all of the celebrities Harris worked with were wealthy enough to donate time and production assistance if they come to. Pretty sure Harris is an idiot and she deserves people calling her out on this grift. I hope all her post election fundraising fails and she has to pay the bill for her failure. Stopping Hitler and saving democracy is important, but you’re not expecting me to do it for free, are you? Not for nothing, but Oprah still has an entire production company. I can think of nothing done for Harris that should have cost a million. Especially as Winfrey could have provided everything at cost, if not fronted it herself. (The one set cost I saw cited would bankrupt most film and television if every set cost that. and even if it wasn’t necessarily from Harpo.) Someday, when the deluded Harris supporters finally recover, Oprah’s reputation may finally be toast. One of the richest women around not only foisted a losing idea on the public, she had to be richly paid to do it. I would think they will finally go Dr. Oz, Dr Phil, liquid diets, Harris…why did we ever think she knew diddly. Cripes she was GOOP before Paltrow. I’ll bet she does know Diddy though. $6 million spent to help down ballot candidates could have dramatically altered a lot of contests. Could have at one time, but the people who knew how to actually GOTV were run out of the Democrat party years ago. The institutional memory, the skills, the techniques — all gone. The Democrats have outsourced their GOTV operations to phony hacks with no clue how to organize voters. Sure, the celebrity campaign was a boondoggle — the spectacle of a Hollywood billionaire, the richest person in the entertainment industry shaking down a political candidate for a pittance she could spend on lunch, was particularly skeevy. And you can multiply that many times over, as the article so fascinatingly does by listing all the has-beens and never-weres that the campaign thought would win them the election. It’s pathetic and indicative of their out-of-touchness that in the end they couldn’t secure an appearance by Alannis Morrisette. Don’t tell me — Hootie and the Blowfish and Courtney Love weren’t available? But the celebrity campaign is really just the bright shiny example, it doesn’t tell the whole story. All the money that Democrats *do* put into the mechanics of campaigns is stupidly spent. They spend it on “data science”. On “new” methods and techniques. On “things and tools” as Harris so eloquently formulated it: databases, targeted ads, shrill fundraising emails, phone calls, text messages. On occasion, they actually knock on doors. But now they only allow “professionals” to do that, and no matter what town you’re in, despite all the “data” they’re armed with, those professionals don’t know anything about you, or your neighborhood, or your town, or what’s important to you. And on the rare occasions that someone opens the door, the “professionals” make it obvious that they don’t care about any of that, either. They’re just about putting you in a box, like “5S” so they can congratulate themselves like a helicopter parent does a toddler (“good job”) before moving on to the next door, where probably no one will answer and they’ll just leave another door hanger. That’s Democrat “voter outreach” now. That’s “engagement”. Show your support for our campaign by “liking” us on BookFace. Get involved with our campaign by buying the merch. Granted, annoying text messages are small-bore compared to genocide, COVID shot mandates, inflation, rigged politics, censorship, saber-rattling, corruption, child poverty, union bashing, hippie punching, and a Dick Cheney endorsement. With such a longass list, any one of those Darwin Award moves could have done in the Democrats by itself. But all those expensive, “innovative”, forward-looking “tools” can’t make up for a cruel, boneheaded, tone-deaf politics. And that’s where Democrat money goes. Another $6 million wouldn’t have made a damn bit of difference with these bozos. They would have gotten better use of all that money by burning it to heat their offices. > All the money that Democrats *do* put into the mechanics of campaigns is stupidly spent.

On “things and tools” as Harris so eloquently formulated it: databases, targeted ads, shrill fundraising emails, phone calls, text messages. Apparently, Democrats now believe that politics is not local; fitting for a globalist party. This tallies with not giving the Democrat capo in Philly walking around money. No walking around money? In Philly? Really? And sure enough, they did badly. It also fits with a mindset that equates large donations with effectiveness, both as a candidate and a legislator. Now with the payments to celebrities, and probably donor owned tech companies and probably donor run NGOs, I am reminded of an Ourbourus, Every thing circles the donations. The donor class gives the candidate money which they use to beg donations from small donors, so they can hire consultants and producers and NGOs for the campaign giving much of the money back to the donor class. But without an “honest liar” as a candidate it is just a snake eating its own tail. Everyone gets their cut, except the small donors, as millions and now billions are spent to elect no one. Or even if they do get elected, their time is spent setting up the next circle. Just in case. The sugar packet cites. “First step to solve economic and financial crises would be to abolish the Noble prize in Economics- Nassib Nicholas Taleb” Funny that. I would like to know the company doing the packets. —– On the measures to prevent disease, #15 squared in red. Indeed. By far, the most frequent infectious diseases are…? Respiratory diseases!- well done! Why it is so? Because we don’t wash our hands frequently enough— Err Because these are almost certainly in most cases transmitted airborne.– well done! “Funny that. I would like to know the company doing the packets.” In the spirit of researching small, good things, I poked around a bit and found this personal blog site: https://havepaprikawilltravel.wordpress.com/2018/09/14/sugar-quotes/ The packets pictured with various words of wisdom are from https://www.azucarlutor.com/ Ignacio: I believe the sugar packet had a coffee brand on the other side, but I failed to note it. The coffee was served in Restaurant El Forcat, C. Roteros 12 in Valencia (sigh, I was there about 1 week before the terrible flooding). Wonder what other slogans they have on their packets? If Lee above is right is a company from Granada. Doesn’t surprise me. “Even Oprah Winfrey charged the campaign $1 million to show up.” Trump might be Hitler-adjacent and a danger to democracy but in neoliberal hell-world the bag must still be secured. (…with apologies to Sally Field) You like me {hands over a million bucks} you really like me! Oprah claims that she was not paid a dime by the Harris campaign. …on the grounds that it went not to her, but to her production company. I remember reading somewhere that when a major corporation is on the edge of death and every officer knows it, there is a better chance of a woman being appointed to be the captain who either rescues the ship or goes down with it. To paraphrase Bugs Bunny from a cartoon I remember . . . ” If its the Captain’s Mess, let her clean it up”. Or go down with it. I wonder if deeply secret private polling showed the Democratic Strategerists that ” this sucker is going down”, in the deathless words of Dubya Bush. And if the sucker is going down, why not let Kamala Harris be the Captain, since she wants it so bad. One thing for sure, in the widest scope, Kamala did not create and fill the sewage lagoon she ended up drowning in. 4 decades of New Yuppie Scumocrats and Clintobamacrats did that, step by careful step. Strangely, or not, I feel no sadness that Kamala drowned in the sewage lagoon. I am sad that she was not joined in that fate by so many deserving Democrats and Democrat parasites. Well, I feel no personal sadness for her, to be sure. She knew the risks and she took her chances. I feel sad for us in that her defeat means TrumpenVance’s victory , and people who thought things couldn’t get worse will feel just how much worse things can get. That’s why I voted for Harris. As Morpheus told Neo in that “Matrix” movie . . . ” There is no bottom.” > There is no bottom “[T]he worst is not So long as we can say ‘This is the worst.'” — William Shakespeare, King Lear breaktimes all day today, ive been trolling through x( i take numerous short breaks while doing this kind of work)…just came across this while waiting for WC: https://x.com/ljmontello/status/1856183302383907004 saw this morning that team blue was freaking that this was the cages guy and the separate the kids guy…but he’s also their guy, too. and, just in case yer blood pressure is too low, for some reason: https://x.com/NobleQAli/status/1854604563384614915 its gonna be a long 4 years.

The viciousness of the sect, selling out their downline, means that not making assumptions follows the precautionary principle.

Best thing for everyone. “Best thing for everyone.” Hmmm…. This sounds a bit too close to G–less Communism to we members of the “Committee For the Suppression of Choice.” (Your contributions not tax deductible.) It’s a conflict resolution variant. i agree. the ballot measures tell a much larger tale than we’ve heard, so far. like the Pew findings over the years that even most gop voters want universal healthcare. we remain unrepresented. and all this yelling about how the country failed kamalamadingdong sure as hell aint helping. at least we havent gotten to the russian interference stage(tm). i find that part particularly tiring. and the Gabriel Winant thing in Dissent is really good…really long, but really good…especially where he starts quoting Stuart Hall and Brecht. The Winant thing: > The Democrats, in other words, comprehensively failed to set the terms of ideological debate in any respect. > It is the structural role and composition of the party that produces its duplicitous and incoherent orientation. It is the mainstream party of globalized neoliberal capitalism, and at the same time, by tradition anyway, the party of the working class. Silly me, I was thinking they didn’t have an ideology, just targets. But I was paying attention to their words. I agree with Lambert, with the caveat that ‘globalized neoliberal capitalism’ is that which Must Not Be Spoke. Because class is implicit, and it’s the opposite of ‘local workers’. back when i was politically active locally…2001 til around 2009 or 10(whenever obamacare turned into what it became)…i was quite the starchild among the local dems(and libertarians and what i call, variously, the front porch/small-c/russel kirk/wendell berry conservatives(such egalitarianism/ecumenicism was unknown to each group, and is in itself pretty remarkable. i’m proud of it))…wrote a lot of letters to the editor of the local brochure, which were printed…influenced, thereby, a few local policy things…and was courted by the local dems to help them with their efforts…back when they had efforts,lol. but when obama got in, the fight was declared over(it wasnt)…i continued advocating in the paper for universal healthcare, or at least a step towards it… but then i and my MIL got invited to obama’s secong inauguration party, at the hilltop manse of a local rich guy(we were the 2 token po folks).waterfall in the foyer, gigantic picture window overlooking the barrio where i then lived, easily ignored if one simply refrained from looking down. and we sat around with the beautiful people, all of them well off and educated, and talked about who had went where to campaign for O…ohio, several other “battleground states”…fine wine, finer scotch, and even a few keystones for us rabble representatives. the talking stick, as it were, finally…and reluctantly…came to me…”joe, what do you think?” and i went to the big window, pointed to my barrio, and said, “i think we need to get the hell off this hill, get down there to the barrio with cabrito and a few kegs of beer, and register people to vote”….utter silence…shoegazing…shuffling of feet…a tiny almost choke on a half swallowed nip of scotch…and then they moved on, as if nothing had been said to upset their reverie…and then it was time to watch Obama speak on the gigantic tv thing…and MIL and i left. i was never called again…my emails were never answered again…the phone was never picked up. i put in the next paper a call for dems to meet me at the cop shop to become deputy voter registrars…and a friend, apolitical, showed up…merely to support me. i registered one person, and gave up on politics. that’s who the democrats are, now…and who they will remain, until the spell is broken, and the current regime crashes and burns utterly. i came down from the hills for Bernie in 2016, but not with the demparty…as an independent force. and went right back to the hills when the dems stole it from him. thats the perspective i’ve watched all this from, ever since. again, Fie! demparty cannot be saved, because they’ve poisoned it since at least clintontimes. they embody covert narcissism, it turns out…something of which i have become an expert, due to my mother(boomer dem wannabe pmc with all the pretensions and assumed superiority we see evidenced on msnbc at any given time). let them go into the wilds with all our sins at long last, and wither away. that is th only way to “reform” them. let them become dust. yes very good and accurate account, this is how it works as soon as PMC-types and educated folks are involved and PR is part of the game – not just politics but any area > i agree. the ballot measures tell a much larger tale than we’ve heard, so far. 100%. Missouri is a fine example. Damion Searls and the philosophy of translation. I have translated from French and Italian into English, from poetry, prose, and theatrical pieces. For some time, I was a member of an association of literary translators. Whenever translators starting talking about translation, they go on endlessly, as if they have to justify the idea of translation — as if translators and interpreters haven’t been around for thousands of years. Translation “theory” is even more deadly boring, although not quite as untethered to reality as queer theory and gender theory. Searls: “As writers go, a translator operates under an especially strong constraint: to produce a text that’s a translation of the original, not some random new thing.” This is “theory”? A long time ago, I read somewhere, or figured out the kernel of the problem myself — a translation of a work of art in the original language has to be a work of art in the target language. This has meant that some drafts of poems that I was trying to translate are still drafts — I can’t seem to get them into English. An Italian poet, whose work I was working on (some of which are those drafts in limbo), himself a noted translator of Proust into Italian, told me that at a certain point in translating, one must just give up. A translation can be beautiful, but usually, it is mainly adequate. This is why I love Moncrieff’s Proust translation. It’s a work of art in and of itself, the language inspired in ways that transcend merely paraphrasing those dense volumes into English (from a rather error ridden French edition, to be sure; Kilmartin did wonderful work availing himself of the corrected later editions to revise the Moncrieff translation). Yes! Big question is will this art survive pattern-based AI translations? Will people understand, see the difference? A.I. has no consciousness which is why prose translation doesn´t work yet. But when data is huge and calculating power enhances eventually you will get a translation of a novel that – and this is the very point – merely resembles the original more or less. (But who cares?) Is it possible the industry actually destroys the art of translation? And this is a very serious cultural issue if these moneyed interests are not checked in time with full force. >>>The Security Gap: Less Secure Group Swing Right IMO, yet again another patronizing take from the journalism class—and “white savior”-adjacent to boot. How about this take: people who don’t push electrons for a living, and people who spend more of their after-tax income on non-discretionary things, moved right. And your take is different from the tweet how? chris christie says trump to deschedule mary jane. https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/11/41910180/exclusive-chris-christie-says-trump-will-remove-federal-restrictions-on-marijuana-find-sweet-spot-for-crypto-regulation i mean, its that guy, and all…err those guys,lol…but if it happens, it sure as heck wasnt on my bingo card. Iowa Governor Harold Hughes was a reformed alcoholic who legalized liquor-by-the-drink in Iowa by enforcing existing laws which were widely disregarded. In no time at all the legislature passed liquor-by-the-drink and state liquor stores lost their monopolies but it did take decades to get ‘strong’ beer into Iowa. All accomplished by a 12-stepper (not a dry drunk, btw) who modernized Iowa liquor laws simply by enforcing them. Teetotaler Trump is exactly the POTUS I’d expect to normalize drug relations. Very glad he’s not doing this Harold Hughes style which would be to restart the war on drugs in the most disruptive and annoying manner possible to force Congress to take action. This will mark 12 steps, er years of having a non-drinker as President, and I’m ready for round 2 of teetotalitarian leader, barkeep please pour me a glass of Malbec and keep ’em coming when you see them nearing empty or me getting tipsy. Now having a toketolerant leader, I did not see that coming~ When Hughes was elected governor for the first time in 1962, the legislative session didn’t begin until mid-year. Hughes deputized the state police and made them shut down the “key clubs”, which were a loophole in the law. By the time the legislature convened, they were all jonesing for a drink and passed the reform quickly. Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying “the best way to get a bad law repealed is to enforce it strictly”. He was correct, of course, but the strategy wouldn’t work in this case. ::musical interlude:: (via YouTube) :) I doubt that Trump will deschedule mary jane. There is way too much money at stake in keeping it scheduled. As Putin has said, presidents get elected and some have ideas, but then the men in dark suits carrying briefcases show up and suddenly the president has a change of heart. Haven’t we seen this play out over and over again? Here is an item from whitepeopletwitter noting that Trump’s pick for SecState, Marco Rubio, has said he would NOT call for a Gaza Ceasefire. It is titled ” Congratulations Dipsh!ts”. Here is the link. https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1gplwwb/congratulations_dipshits/ But there are always tradeoffs in life, and maybe this is an acceptable price to pay for imposing peace on Ukraine. And to those who say it is not, I can only say ” Don’t blame me, I voted for Harris.” Actual quote from Trump today, after nominating Mike Huckabee to be the new ambassador to Israel: Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!” That’s the exact same language that Joe used when referencing his team (Blinken, Burns.) Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Excuse me while I now go pet an emotional support animal. And do not blame me, I voted for Jill Stein. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-nominates-mike-huckabee-us-ambassador-israel?msockid=2d204d3eb7166bef256e59a3b6406ab1 A guinea pig would be most appropriate for an emotional support animal… Gawd, when I first read that about Huckabee, I thought it must be from The Onion. Reality is getting worse by the moment. It’s going to take more than an emotional support animal to get through this. And don’t blame me, l didn’t vote for Trump. Charles Krauthammer coined the phrase “Oval Office OJ.” That was a bit of a hyperbolic reference to Bill Clinton after he got caught with that woman. But it rings true here. Neither party is interested in peace, or stopping the killing, just pretending like they didn’t commit the crime. Or in our case act as an accessory to murder. Best of wishes. The Lou Reed song comes to mind: Busload of faith to get by I like the “emotional support aminal” that Big Gretch fed in that infamous Pet Care video. It gets better. Trump seems to have just nominated a Fox newscaster, Pete Hegseth, for defense secretary. I was hoping for Tulsi. Not a good sign. I googled Pete Hegseth, and he is a serious war crime enthusiast. Makes Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men look like a shrinking violet. Methinks we are going to get our war-mongering straight up, not on the rocks. To modify your meme a bit, the Ship of State is now steering right for the rocks. What is funny about this is that Trump may well subconsciously be playing the part of America’s Nemesis. “You’ve been causing trouble for me for the last eight years. Now I’m going to show you what real trouble looks like.” Fellow Chris, I have no doubt Mr. Huckabee is capable of supporting that goal. Graveyards are quite peaceful. No children laughing. No people arguing. No traffic noise. No messy moral conflicts. No ethical concerns. No claims of “just war”. No hostages. Just peaceful dirt blowing through empty ruins filled with the dead. Mostly women and children. It will be peace the likes of which the world hasn’t known for millenia. I hope the stifling quiet drives whoever lives there completely mad. Gaza has the bones of a real supernatural horror story. The lurking shadows at the end of the hall in the sparkling new beachside condo in Gaza. The faintly heard cries of playing children out on the beach in the middle of the night during the full moon. But when you go out to look, nothing is there. Then you stub your toe on a half-buried child’s baby doll. But the beach commission is supposed to have cleaned up the beaches already! What’s that? It gleams dully in the moonlight. You go closer and see a land mine freshly washed up by the tide. You turn to go back and find yourself surrounded by mines. How did this happen? The condo by the sea idea is slowly but surely losing its allure. Suddenly you see a pattern in the mines laying around you. They are in a hopscotch pattern! Did some children put them there? What children? This is an Elder Condo, no children allowed except to visit. Something is wrong. Ets. etc. Stay safe. Watch where you step. I did not vote for Harris or Trump because their support for Israel is support for genocide. You passed the test, congratulations! Me three. I cannot imagine how Trump can bring peace to the Middle East but it is theoretically possible. I could envision no path to peace with Team Harris (or Biden). From my reading I have gathered that the road to peace in the Middle East goes through the grave. And to underline the point, it’s not clear that we’re getting peace in Ukraine out of this either. https://reason.com/2024/11/12/trumps-reported-national-security-advisor-supports-bombing-russia-and-afghanistan/ Poor guy thinks that it is still the 1990s. Boy, isn’t he in for a surprise. Most of those countries on his hate list can now shoot back. As I understand it, by the time Trump is in office most of NATO’s member countries will be in violation of the 2% of GDP rule agreed upon in the Wales Summit Declaration (NATO) (Article 14) in 2014. Here (also NATO) is a handy graph (#2). If my memory serves me here, Trump makes a lot of noise about member countries being deadbeats. There will be meat on that bone this time around. I see a lot of gloating going on among Democrats and others about Trump’s neocon picks. (No, I don’t see too much of it here because I think people here are much better informed.) What I do have to say is I have always been very impressed with how responsive the Republican party is to it’s voters – it’s much more responsive than the Democrats who routinely $hit on their supporters, and Trump’s supporters did get Pompeo removed. That is an achievement. Trump responds to public pressure! I mean we’re talking about war here. And we don’t want war. So how about we support them in their efforts? How about instead of don’t blame me we say I don’t want war, what can I do? I mean I didn’t vote for the guy, but I certainly want what’s best for my country, and we are where we are. I get a kick out of the bookends on the ap votecast bar chart Well OK, let me re-phrase this in a way that could motivate more voters… Tired of how the Democrats blow you off? Tired of having a rich ex-President lecture you on how to vote? Pile in on that X effort to convince Trump to dump the neocons. Attach a video about how you are working with your fellow citizens to help shape Trump’s Presidency because he listens to the voters, and he listens to the citizens that didn’t even vote for him. So rather than having an ex-President lecturing YOU on how to VOTE, he’s listening to US on how to run AMERICA. I mean, imagine being Clinton or Obama and watching THAT. That’s like slipping the dagger in, giving it a good twist, and snapping it off at the hilt. Rhetorically speaking of course. I have added orts and scraps. The quality of the blame cannonry and the post-election analysis is improving, which is a mercy/ LOL wrt the Spanish sugar packet! :D Grover Cleveland’s 2nd term started with a financial panic where money was really scarce, silver coins dated from 1893 to 1895 being the most valuable years of all, as few were minted. What if ‘Trump 2-the Sequel’ started similarly? “Return of the Creature From the DC Swamp?” Oh, be still my beating heart! Trump as the “Swamp Thing.” (I don’t see him as the Toxic Avenger. You know that character. The long-lost evil twin brother of the Hulk.) My Elliotician says the odds favor a massive move upward in the barbarous relic, with silver headed to test the long-term high in the 40’s. It won’t happen likely in time for Christmas, but February is a distinct possibility. Confetti money drives out the good, and once the moneyed classes figure out that their 401k is a 201k factoring in inflation, it’s Katy bar the door! I’m thinking more along the lines of something that matters to everybody, the current value of their abodes not abiding and in fact free falling, as inflation gathers steam in everything else they purchase. To coin an old phrase, a financial panic. The problem with confetti money will become apparent when and if the masses have a divine revelation, sort of like Moses when he saw the burning bush. All that funny-money being printed up is really quite worthless when you get down to it. At least a Kennedy quarter had some silver in it. Tricky Dick really fooled us good in 1971, and here we are almost 54 years later still swallowing the trickwitchery. We’re a ways away from that, but maybe all the reckless talk of tax cuts, guns, and butter will do the trick. I need boundless and unfettered fiat money to keep going for at least another couple decades, as its all I know, as well as pretty much all of my fellow citizenry. It’d be tantamount to removing all the lane dividers on the 405 @ rush hour were the fiat lady to sing, kinda bad. What possible financial wrecks have we cataloged for 2025 on NC so far? Last I checked it looked like we were going to have: (1) a collapse in home prices, (2) a complete collapse of the commercial real estate market, (3) market contagion from any banks exposed to either of those via MBS or CMBS, (4) shenanigans from inflation revving back up with the rate cuts, (5) possible supply side shocks from China restricting key inputs, (6) further labor issues from strikes, (7) possible price shocks from tarrifs being put in place prior to industrial policy, (8) huge swings in public sector workforce due to St. Musk pulling a Twitter on the federal government employee population, (9) labor related issues from possible mass deportation or the implied threat of mass deportation, (10) increasing risk of HPAI breakout in US. Oh, and, (11) weird weather causing grid failures this winter. Let me know if I’m forgetting anything.

As a release I recommend finding a med industry mba and be short tempered and mean and when they ponder the dire state of the dem party suggest firmly that the fact that 9 out of 10 med industry mba’s are dems is the problem. apologies to yves for being too broad, let’s say nine out of ten pharma industry mba’s and their private equity brethren instead… Why can’t Democrats just accept Harris was a shitty candidate? In 2019, Sanders was so good I switched voter registration from Republican to Democrat just to be able to cast my vote for him when the circus rolled into town. Unfortunately, when it did, the smoke filled room had already anointed Biden in SC. So amidst a pandemic, I presented myself in person and cast my vote for Sanders anyway. Come November I vote for DJT for the same reason I voted for him in 2016, Joe Biden was the same corrupt piece of crap as Hillary Clinton (saying a lot because HRC is the queen of corrupt alongside Rep Pelosi). However, had Senator Sanders been the nominee in 2020, I would have voted for him (and he would have won). Come this election, a) it probably wouldn’t have included DJT, but b) if it had I would have voted for Sanders again. I’m your basic Republican trending toward middle of the road voter. Democrats just need to run someone good. And their line up for 2028 doesn’t have anyone good in my opinion. Pritzker, Newsome, Whitmer, Butigeig, Kahana, et al? The whole lot can go to Hell. Notice I don’t even mention Harris . . . she’ll never run again, and if she’s stupid enough to try, she drops out before the first primary just like last time because she’s a shit candidate. Both of her Presidential runs set a lot of donor money on fire. No one will want to look stupid and so won’t back her again. Unfortunately hers may be the only one whose future career options took a hit. Not even her husband and brother in law will get blackballed much less the top Obama and Clinton retreads that were part of the campaign. To be fair, the Dem platform also sucked – basically it was “Joe Biden did everything perfectly.” Bernie could not have won on that platform. re Oprah-gate–Oprah says she was not personally paid a million dollars but turns out her production company was paid a million to stage one of the Harris rallies. https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/oprah-winfrey-never-paid-million-kamala-harris-campaign-1236207187/ Which doesn’t answer the question of why the mega rich Winfrey didn’t volunteer her company’s services for free as well. Tis a mystery. Company policy? Simple greed? If you are that good, charge for it? Lots of people got Oprah’s number when she had to be barred bringing in her film crew into a relief center in Maui in order to publicize herself. I have a longer comment in moderation about how none of it adds up. (And I even went for providing service at cost versus gratis.) But yeah, Winfrey has a long record of bad recommendations. I do believe that a majority of the deluded Harris supporters will get that she was a terrible candidate who had nothing to offer, and Oprah knew it but took the money anyway. May both fade into the mists of time. Who knew that Pol Ticketron is the best place to procure ‘sold-out’ acts. Who sold out? Don’t be surprised to discover a close bond between American political Parties and procurers. For example, Epstein-Bare Virus, which is, naturally, an STD. I was never particularly optimistic -shocking I know- but Trump’s appointments seem characteristically bad. Oh well. It’s gonna be a fun four years. We’ve got a collision course with Trumpflation as well if he succeeds with tariffs and deportations. Oh, it could be a mess. Trying to cut interest rates and taxes with inflation going up. How does it usually go? Prices will be going up and stats will say it’s just “vibes”. Trump is going to do a lot of things any sane person will despise: Bully Jay Powell into cutting interest rates back to zero; Nominate warmongers; Fire Lina Khan, the best public servant we’ve had in years. You cannot vote your way out of what is coming. Maybe Trump will bring it faster. I never see anybody obsessed with money doing the kind of things I like to do, which invariably cost nothing more than gas & food money, even though we can obtain a similar scale of exclusivity that Illionaires crave in living their sheltered pampered lives, but perhaps not having a price tag on my experiences lessens its allure, dramatically.

To Survive, the Democratic Party Needs to Transform Itself.” I guess they are saying that the party should go back to the future? I mean the party had been organized and run right down to the neighborhood level up until the 1980s. And the Republicans, while never as community oriented, had also been far more organically involved at the county and city levels decades ago. Both are far more brittle than they look. not brittle where it really counts, like ballot access, media access, debate access, funding, etc. they both seem pretty strong in those areas, still….but legitimacy crises rolls and tumbles right along, under the floors, and will not be denied. ive seen allusions to…but no hard data(no time, these weeds hafta be pulled right now) the idea that overall voter turnout was down quite a bit…i expect that to continue and get much much worse, much quicker than anybody expects. i voted this time around by staying home. so did many others, mostly on the dem side. shunning the entire crooked and evil mess. Fie! It wasn’t that long ago that they went to court and showed that they were like a club that did not have to listen to their members – and they won. The Republicans would be somewhat similar. Here in Oz over thirty years ago one of the main parties had a major ‘reform.’ Up til then, local branches would choose who would stand for them in their seat and if they won, represent them in Parliament. Afterwards, that party was free to parachute all manner of people into those seats that did not live there or know the people. The other party was doing the same and was even parachuting in ‘celebrity’ candidates which never worked at all. How will community organizing work when all they have is contempt for anybody not already in the cult? Well, Howard Dean had some success trying to reinvigorate the Democratic grassroots, and the party elites couldn’t wait to throw him and all his efforts in the trash. So this is what we’ve ended up with: a rootless party with crappy candidates, supported by billionaires and celebrities, pushing militarism and foreign slaughters with an asphyxiatingly heavy dose of identity politics layered on top of that, a combination that will never appeal to a plurality of voters. And they don’t even seem to have any insight, self-awareness, or–let’s face it–brains. Just big egos and big delusions. People like Dean, Al Gore, Gary Hart, and some of the others from that era may have had bad positions on some of the issues, but you at least felt like they were intelligent and able to adapt to reality not matching their expectations. Howard Dean had some success trying to reinvigorate… Howard Dean in recent years has been a fierce neo-conservative, and severely undermined Bernie Sanders especially in concert with Neera Tanden (now of the Biden administration). Dean and Tanden worked to drive Representative Tulsi Gabbard from the Democratic Party for standing against military strikes on Syria. https://twitter.com/govhowarddean/status/850895059771957248 Howard Dean ✔@GovHowardDean This is a disgrace.

Tulsi Gabbard: “Yes, I’m skeptical” of claim Assad regime is behind chemical weapons attack 7:32 PM – 7 Apr 2017 John Ratcliffe is Trump’s nominee as Director of the CIA. Another (former) Republican Congressman, who served as Director of National Intelligence in the last year of the Trump administration. The main controversies back then were his challenges to the Russiagate narrative. I just read the Wikipedia article on Ratcliffe. It is pretty amazing, in that it still asserts a number of Russiagate claims as true that have been proven false, and vice versa. Hard to tell where this guy would fall on the “warmonger” scale. But he did give the Establishment fits on Russiagate, which is a plus in my book. Here’s his Wikipedia page. Pretty entertaining: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ratcliffe_(American_politician) thanks 4 info On the other hand what´s your problem? German legacy daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG today has a big interview about Trump up-close and personal with none other than: CHRISTOPHER FUCKING STEELE! Even without the paywall you get this magnificent picture of Putin holding baby Trump (NOT baby Yoda!): https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/trump-putin-steele-dossier-wahlbeeinflussung-lux.VHXwZ2yC2maewnZ5z54YGn?reduced=true “”Trump is a vengeful man” “Christopher Steele unwittingly rose to fame in 2017 with the dossier that investigated Donald Trump’s involvement with Russia. How does the British ex-agent now view his re-election?” Gosh this guy must be a real hero! p.s. Well, you have to grant Ratcliffe that he has no Wikispooks entry to his name, yet. Rubio does: FWIW https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Marco_Rubio I love those Ratcliffe eyebrows. They remind me of the eyebrows of a certain American president who too came from Texas. A beautiful human being. Must be a hell of a place with countless remarkable American patriotic men. BUT, one has to indeed admit, Wikipedia says Ratcliffe was providing DISINFORMATION! How cool is that. “(…) Thirty-five days before the November 2020 election, Ratcliffe declassified 2016 Russian disinformation that asserted Hillary Clinton had personally approved a scheme to associate Trump with Vladimir Putin and Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Ratcliffe provided the disinformation to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, who publicly released it. The allegation had been previously rejected as baseless by the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee. Ratcliffe acknowledged in a letter to Graham that the intelligence community “does not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.”[82] The intelligence community opposed the release of the information.[83] According to the New York Times, Ratcliffe’s disclosure “appeared to be a bid to help Mr. Trump politically.” (…)” Yes, Wimpypedia is “entertaining”, it is not a source for truth. “Leaving and Waving” Saw something similar with this English couple. They took a picture of themselves in their backyard with their house behind them. Did it every year like clockwork but then one year there was only the husband and a few years later, nobody. But the saddest photo of that ‘Leaving and Waving’ series was the last one where it was just the house. For the person taking that photo, it would have been probably a good bye to the house they grew up with with their parents and all the memories. i couldnt bring myself to look at all that…still too near, 2 1/2 years later. “her absence is like the sky, spread over everything” -C.S. Lewis Yes. That is a wonderful book about loss. Lewis was a versatile writer. (He went through the same loss himself.) I have something similar. Every year before traveling home from our Christmas gathering, we took a few pictures of my family and my parents. Nothing planned, it just turned out we were in roughly the same spot. The kids (and some times the adults) grumbled, but we got a few pictures every year, missing a handful of years because weather kept us apart. 2023, both parents passed. This year the house was sold so the tradition ends… but we have +20 years. From youngsters to college age. Maybe I will put them in an album. Makes me appreciate my wife’s perseverance in this task despite the rest of us moaning about it. I try and tell our children that with each passing, a bit of up close and personal history disappears. Try and preserve as much as you can. Alas, they are still too young (40s) to understand. Bloomborg price is a riot, so his survey was given to like 5 squillionaires vs 30000 normal people and that’s “science” These sociologists… But obviously happiness still increases after 75k a year…unless that’s 75k in interest! If you are a millionaire , would you answer you are unhappy with your life ?. Bloomberg/WSJ study will says more money more happiness. Minimalist magazine would says the opposite. These studies are not worth the piece of paper they are written on These sociologists are writing what they are paid to, in order to increase their own personal happines. Their end goal is probably to get on depicted Vessel of happiness and sail directly to the Epstein Island, where The ‘Happiness Plateau’ Doesn’t Exist. Yep. I spent a lot of my academic career pointing out what mathematical properties “happiness scores” must possess in order to make all these statements like “this group does better by achieving x” or “this country is happier”. Basically if you state “4” then you must have twice as must utility as when you state “2”….difference between 6 and 4 must be same as between 3 and 1….and then this must hold ACROSS people. RATIO scales. Otherwise you can’t do mathematical operators. There is not a single study in world history that confirms this. It is “not even wrong”. Plus there are a multitude of studies showing that happiness or life satisfaction scores for retired people are absolutely inconsistent with younger people. I won’t bore people again but they are out there in plain sight. NC even in links showcased a study within the last year suggesting that young people had changed their internal reference scale to give happiness scores. If you see a rating scale then you are probably safe to assume it is garbage. If you want justification, e-mail the authors to ask “do your rating scale numbers satisfy ratio scale properties, as accepted by neuro-scientists?” Betcha they won’t reply. I won’t even start on the “quirks” people have re certain numbers…..I have a NSFW posting about what traditional Chinese people do with certain numbers. It involves soft and hard. Go figure. Tkacik, “and the proliferating subsistence entrepreneur class”. There, they’ve done it, the Democrats have re-created the “peasant” or “serf”, now neoliberally ennobled! I’ve had recent experience with “subsistence entrepreneurs”. The ones I know are excellent people, and I mean that, they are genuinely good, well intentioned people, mostly female immigrants who’s small scale and very publicly spirited enterprises live off grants from various Democrat controlled State development and re-development agencies. Shall we refer to the bureaucrats with sinecures in these agencies as “the entitled tax farmers”? At least at the state D level in New York, it is the political distribution of tax receipts through these “entitled tax farmers” that commands the fealty of the “subsistence entrepreneur class”. I suppose they were supposed to be the future of the Democrat party, but their significant others voted differently (that “it’s okay to lie to your spouse” thing appears to have backfired). It is kind of shocking how incompetent the Democrat party is, that they’ve been pursuing Trump for 8 endless years now. And completely failed. Totally. The full weight of the Establishment media, national security state, judicial system, and he evaded them all. They’ve failed so completely even the putative resistance hasn’t materialized this time. Wowzers. Functionally inept bankrupt party. That stands for nothing but gifting. How’d that billion dollars work out for you? On the other hand. As a rearguard action against the left, a success again. So the Democrat party is doing it’s job. And moving Overton Window to the far right. yes to this, thanks… The reason why there could be no primary is to not allow real issues to surface, and kamala had strict instructions to not give an inch…tax credits? Don’t make me barf…and now newly resurgent working class bernie makes it plain imo. here, chew on this,lol:https://apnews.com/article/trump-staff-picks-stefanik-wiles-stephen-miller-tom-homan-243d73610b03a3ee18c4d5f68756af7c?taid=6733fbca0264b50001628290 i laughed all the way through reading it. we’re well into idiocracy territory, here, and its well deserved. woe to all us firemonkeys, fucking in the mud…and abandon our pretensions to anything above that status. collapse of empire, here we come. embrace it. Someone on MoA said it well – we’re on autopilot and the new crew doesn’t know how to fly. > we’re on autopilot and the new crew doesn’t know how to fly Let’s just hope there’s no MCAS. a real estate guy as special envoy to middle east(ie: israel) i mean….is it trolling? jeez. to live in such times….. • Democrats, as we would expect, are doubling down on this behavior: There’s a concerted effort to move high(er)-traffic accounts off Twitter onto Blue Sky, as if the world needed more Democrat embubblement than it already has. Further, for all its many faults, Elon Musk’s hell-site still has a very functional Covid-conscious community, which these trolls would end up splitting, not that such a thing would matter to them. Brunch at Blue Sky! – Lambert above. From my travels I see a large effort to move from X to Blue Sky. Embubblement is right. Can’t deal with anything outside of that. Not that I’m defending X. They hate Trump, Musk, Putin – the axis of evil. Only to get more wild with the latest news. Trump taps Musk to lead a ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ with Ramaswamy From NPR. Can be found all over. More hair catching on fire. The dream of drowning government in a bathtub really is at hand. Thanks Obama! > Trump taps Musk to lead a ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ with Ramaswamy I think Warren’s snark doesn’t quite hit the mark: The Office of Government Efficiency is off to a great start with split leadership: two people to do the work of one person. Yeah, this seems REALLY efficient. https://t.co/XXKvrUAPkE — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) November 13, 2024 It’s not a matter of efficiency; it’s a matter of “What kind of chain of command is this?” (To be fair, there were two Roman Consuls). Further, if you think government should be run like a business (it shouldn’t be) Musk did succeed in massively reducing headcount at Twitter while that very large platform continued to perform. So, efficiency. But since Musk never did figure out how to run a paint booth (heck, QA) at Tesla, I would attribute that more to Silicon Valley bloat than anything else (and other Silicon Valley moguls followed his lead). It would be the same at Boeing: Massive headcount reductions would hit people with wrenches pretty fast. So is government more like Twitter (massive bloat) or Boeing (muscle close to the skin)? My instinct, as a quondam liberal, is to say the latter, but today I am either more cynical or realistic. NOAA muscle and DOE fat* would be my guess; CDC/NIH almost entirely fat at the administrative level, muscle at the science level. USDA I bet is fat all the way down to the inspectors. Social Security is all muscle. And so forth. Whether Musk/Ramaswamy will swing the axe out of ideology or actual merit remains to be seen. Oh, and Trump pairing Ramaswamy with Musk is an enormous mark of favor. Man, some of those Swedes really need take take a chill pill. So a Russian Orthodox Church was built on the outskirts of the Swedish town of Västerås. Suddenly there are accusations that it is a national security threat and it could be used as cover for future intelligence or sabotage operations- https://www.politico.eu/article/new-russian-orthodox-church-suspicion-sweden-town-vasteras/ Maybe those same people should check under their beds, You know, just in case. “Kamala Fell to the Same Cabal That Destroyed University Presidents” [Maureen Tkacik, The American Prospect]. For me the killer quote line from the article was the following: But the highest-profile victims of the purge were cautious, pragmatic people trying too hard to appease a capricious and bottomlessly vengeful boss class It reminded me so much of the TV series “Snowpiercer”. The Mr. Wilford character in that series is the boss of all that’s left of humanity remaining on a train making revolutions around the globe. You want to be in the good graces of Mr. Wilford lest ye not be chosen to stay on the train. Not only stay in the good graces but demonstrate your value/worth. Not all that different than needing to stay in the good graces of and prove your value to the boss at work lest ye lose your job. Getting back to the article, Trump is of the “boss class”; Trump doesn’t need to stay in the good graces of anybody. Kamala has the disadvantage of obviously not being of the “boss class” or at least not the same “boss class”. That said, Kamala had options. One option was to portray herself as a member of the “boss class” that has claimed virtuous authority – the authority at war with deplorables and irredeemables. Another option was to portray herself as a member of the “boss class” that comes from exercizing governmental authority. Biden could have done Kamala a solid if he had just resigned mid term and let Kamala have the reins. Or Kamala could have embraced “servant class” membership as a servant of the people. Instead we got Kamala as member of the “servant class” to the “boss class”, as per the article a member in good standing and making sure to stay in good standing by being obedient. Which any intuitive voter could sniff out. Anyways, highly recommend “Snowpiercer”. I think the readers here would find it right up their alley as a study in particular of the “boss class” and fascism and democracy and where does power come from. But at the end of the day it’s just good story telling and a rollicking one at that (pun intended). Sean Bean does a wonderful job playing the Mr. Wilford character as if his Ned Stark character in Game of Thrones had gone-to-the-“survival of the fittest”-side, a charismatic of the “boss class”. He’s not the only charismatic, not the only fascist in the story, but unlike the others embraces it. Plenty of parallels to personalities in the US. I’ve had contacts who are highly observant but not in academia intuit and observe the sort of behavior you highlighted in the Moe Tkacik quote at the top. I can’t exactly replicate some of the colorful phrase-making, but “Revenge of HR ladies” comes close. And that particular rendering comes from a woman, a pretty high profile and top professional in her field, who finds herself somewhat hostage to that type at her company, and regularly and loudly say that allowing women into leadership roles was a mistake. I do not buy that conclusion at all, but I think there is a case to be made that women were given important posts far out of proportion to the ones who had the skills and temperament to be very good at it. > making sure to stay in good standing by being obedient PMC through and through. My (executive) late mother’s advice was ‘go along to get along.’ Some of us bristle at that. I became day-job self-employed. Trump builds out national security team with picks of Hegseth for Pentagon, Noem for DHS AP Fresh faces… Entertainingly, one of the largest Covid outbreaks in the US came at a meatpacking plant in South Dakota on Noem’s watch, good job. Much is being made of Hegseth’s stint at Gitmo, but then if Obama had shut Gitmo down, as he promised…. Anyhow, Hegseth went to Princeton and then got a masters Public Policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, so presumably he meets at least some sort of baseline, the same as the other usual suspects. Anyhow, giving new meaning to the phrase “political appointees,” they not being appointed for their expertise. Presumably if the civil service beneath them retains some functionality, that will help them. “Public Policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard”? Oh no… p.s. John Krasinski “Sexiest Man Alive”! How much did he pay them? His goofy face is what you usually get when you want a stereotype for your modern-day understanding father figure in a Pixar movie about a precocious girl that intends to fly to Mars and who has “mother-issues”. Did I forget ticking a box? Gosh, I miss those days when watching a Disney movie you could sense the abuse all over the story… re: CHINA US EU German BERLINER ZEITUNG, Engl. China relies on Trump: “Biden’s industrial policy was a stab in the back for Europe” Donald Trump’s return to the White House is putting US-Chinese relations to the test. Europe will also be challenged. A guest article. by Gao Jian https://archive.is/WFBFm About the author: Professor Gao Jian is Director of the Centre for European Studies at Shanghai International Studies University and an expert at the China Forum of the Chinese think tank Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University (CISS). He writes columns for several international media outlets. For those who are acquainted with the German CORRECTIV “controversy”: the CEO of the “NGO” is now campaigning for Robert Habeck, Jeannette Gusko. BERLINER ZEITUNG brief report “Switch to the Greens: Correctiv leadership now campaigns for Robert Habeck The Greens are bringing the co-director of the media company Correctiv into their election campaign team. Correctiv has not revealed exactly what role Jeannette Gusko will take on.” https://archive.is/MLR7n I never took CORRECTIV seriously for a second since the moment they were founded some 10 years ago. (Their name gave them away – think “PRAVDA”?) Just as past year German JACOBIN´s senior editor Ines Schwerdtner switched to THE LEFT. There is no difference to the German state media which have been doing this for decades. Many spokespeople for the chancellor originated with German state media. So that´s that. Re: Proposals to reform the Democratic Party: ” Maps. There should be an accountable Democratic captain for every neighborhood in the country.” We moved to a suburb of Denver in 2007 and I became immersed in Colorado politics, including dedicating a large part of my life to Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008. I received a call from a local political activist and party official (I thought), asking me to be a precinct captain. There was, apparently, an existing precinct captain, who was an employee in the pro-abortion lobbying group then known as NARAL, but her existence was hand-waved out of mind. So, I got my list, knocked on doors, talked to people, tried to get to know ‘my’ precinct and do some organizing. After the election, I talked with local party officials about getting precinct meetings going, in preparation for the next elections. I was informed that I was not really the ‘official’ precinct captain, that my name had never been submitted to party leadership, and thus never ratified. So, I was, politely, being told to ‘bug off.’ I tried again prior to the next presidential election, at a breakfast meeting with local and county Dem officials. I talked with the Dem county head about the importance of having precinct captains working at grass roots level, knowing their constituency, organizing precinct meetings, gathering ideas and information and having that flow upwards. Hah! I was met with a blank stare and told in no uncertain terms, that the ideas and information and direction would come from the top. Well, after another real estate crisis or decade of cutting public sector or no potable tab water they will re-think. As I said for Germany: Too many are too rich still for anything to happen big time. Especially those liaison between locals and top-brass on national level. The arrogance you describe gives them their pride. I assume it´s not that different from Germany where most people who start out in local politics with great expectations as newbie organizers or activists turn away quickly due to the arrogance they encounter. Parties on the parliamentary level give a damn. It appears to be different with AfD because it was in part nurtured from the “bottom” up (no misunderstanding, AfD did not originate with poverty-struck people!) But they took traction when the German establishment went all DNC on those. And BSW is too young and too small to add them here. And now what are they doing – again attempting to ban a party, AfD – and among the ones agreeing to this, German LEFT PARTY. How can they dare with the tradition of Communist parties in Germany being banned and harassed since 1945. p.s. have they come back to you begging for support yet? Slime Emily Oster emerges from the depths There’s a Better Way to Talk About Fluoride, Vaccines and Raw Milk But there’s a real danger to painting everyone with concerns about fluoride as a conspiracy theorist. It’s not that we should remove fluoride from tap water (we shouldn’t), but fluoride is a complex topic, and glossing over that complexity — as public health experts and agencies often do — leaves people understandably skeptical. Public health agencies typically tell people what to do and what not to do, but they don’t regularly explain why — or why people might hear something different from others. They also often fail to prioritize. In the end, advice for a range of topics is delivered with the same level of confidence and, seemingly, the same level of urgency. The problem is that when people find one piece of guidance is overstated, they may begin to distrust everything. Lol. Like kids can’t get COVID. What an evil person.

Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy and markets NEW YORK -- Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy. Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they’ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs. Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else. — Stan Choe Here's a look at where Wall Street is placing its bets at the moment: Technology stocks soared in Trump’s first term, helped by the administration’s tax policies. But the relationship was tempestuous: Trump’s immigration stance threatened a source of high-skilled immigrants that comprises a significant part of the industry’s work force and his trade wars threatened international sales and supply chains. This time around, tech could benefit from an anticipated loosening of antitrust regulation that discouraged big deals from getting done and threatened to rein in the power of Google, Apple and Amazon. What’s more, Trump is expected to clear the way for Big Tech to make more inroads in artificial intelligence technology — an area increasingly seen as a crucial battleground in the duel for global power between the U.S. and China. Trump’s vow to impose tariffs and other restrictions on trade does pose a potential downside for chip makers, particularly stock market darling Nvidia. A possible rollback of Biden administration efforts to boost U.S. semiconductor production also is a concern. Still, in a sign of tech’s more conciliatory attitude, Trump’s election was greeted by congratulatory posts from most of the industry’s luminaries, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. — Michael Liedtke Trump’s victory brings a big dose of uncertainty for the retail industry. Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He also wants to further cut the corporate tax rate. Those would be tailwinds for shoppers and businesses, analysts said. But the president-elect’s trade proposals could have a huge downside. He’s proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and tariffs of 10% to 20% on other imports. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, said retailers would either take a big hit on profits or be forced to increase prices. As opposed to Trump’s first term, retailers will have a harder time absorbing tariffs this time because their costs of doing business are already higher, Saunders said. Many companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year. The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher prices for U.S. shoppers if Trump’s new tariffs are implemented. For example, an $80 pair of men’s jeans would cost $90 to $96. — Anne D'Innocenzio Trump has said he wants to “drill, drill, drill” starting on Day 1 of his presidency, so it’s expected that traditional fossil fuel-focused companies will get a boost and renewable energy outfits could be disadvantaged. Oilfield services companies including Haliburton and Schlumberger would likely benefit from initiatives to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Natural gas companies including EQT and CNX Resources could benefit from facilities and pipeline projects. Meanwhile, clean energy companies, such as First Solar and many electric vehicle makers, could have a harder time growing if Trump cuts tax credits and other incentives for the industry. But remember Trump’s first term, says Austin Pickle, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The thought back then, like now, was that Trump would boost prices for oil-and-gas stocks. But energy stocks ended up struggling late in his term when the price of oil briefly went below zero during the COVID-19 pandemic. — Damian Troise Drugmakers, insurers and other health care companies could benefit from fewer regulatory roadblocks to mergers and a lighter regulatory stance overall. Insurers, in particular, may see some regulatory relief for Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of the government’s Medicare program mainly for people ages 65 and older. Under Democratic leadership, some insurers were facing smaller bonus payments tied to their Medicare Advantage plans. Some drugmakers are facing revenue hits on certain drugs covered by Medicare. Those challenges could abate under Republican rule, analysts at Morningstar noted. A second Trump administration also may challenge health care companies. The approval of drugs and vaccines could become less predictable, depending on the role anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plays, said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. Health insurers that sell coverage on the Affordable Care Act’s insurance marketplaces or manage state-and-federally funded Medicaid coverage could face challenges if Republicans attempt to dismantle parts of the law, said Julie Utterback of Morningstar. In particular, extra subsidies that help people buy marketplace coverage are slated to expire at the end of next year, which could lead to enrollment drops. — Tom Murphy The auto industry is another that should welcome less restrictive regulations but dread tariffs. Trump is likely to roll back or scrap tailpipe emissions limits for 2027 through 2032 imposed by the Biden administration. Companies like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis could more easily sell larger, less-efficient vehicles without paying hefty fines. Companies would also face less pressure to sell more electric vehicles to offset emissions from big trucks and SUVs, which make big profit margins, said Kevin Tynan, research director for The Presidio Group. Tariffs are a different story. Trump has threatened tariffs on imported vehicles to force more production in the U.S. The threat of 100% tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico is a big concern. Morningstar analyst David Whiston said such tariffs could potentially cost General Motors, Stellantis and Ford billions in profits. About 30% of GM’s North American production comes from Mexico, while it’s 24% for Stellantis and about 15% for Ford. Whiston notes that tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico would violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement negotiated during Trump’s first term. But that can be reworked in July of 2026. Whiston said those tariffs would mean higher prices and many buyers already can’t afford the current average price of over $47,000. Trump also has threatened to get rid of electric vehicle tax credits that have helped boost sales of EVs. — Tom Krisher Bank stocks could benefit if Trump's policies boost the U.S. economy and more customers apply for loans. In addition, Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo believes the Trump victory can usher in a “new era” of lighter financial regulation after 15 years of stricter oversight following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Under Biden, banks were facing requirements to set aside more capital to reduce risk, but the Trump administration is likely to take a step back. Dealmaking could see a revival under Trump, which would help banks with large investment banking operations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. That also increases the odds the pending merger between Capital One Financial and Discover Financial gets federal clearance. Regional banks should benefit if a growing economy prompts the creation of new small businesses or the expansion of existing ones. — Paul Harloff Construction companies are looking at a mixed bag, with lighter regulations a plus but higher materials costs a potential minus. Construction companies, including homebuilders KB Home and PulteGroup, could benefit from tax incentives and more friendly regulations. A surge in development could help relieve some pressure on a housing market pressured by a lack of supply for new homes. A boost in construction could also help suppliers of raw materials including steel and aggregates used in concrete. But the potential for overall raw material price increases is a threat. Higher costs could cut into profits for construction companies and homebuilders. Steel tariffs could help shield U.S. producers from competition, but a jump in global prices as a result could negate that benefit, while also squeezing construction companies. Plans for an immigration crackdown could worsen an existing labor shortage and result in delays for projects. — Damian Troise Trump, once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has surged above $86,000. Shares of crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 60% since the election. Crypto industry players welcomed Trump’s victory, in hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for. And Trump had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government’s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight. — Wyatte Grantham-Phillips 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy and markets NEW YORK -- Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy. Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they’ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs. Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else. — Stan Choe Here's a look at where Wall Street is placing its bets at the moment: Technology stocks soared in Trump’s first term, helped by the administration’s tax policies. But the relationship was tempestuous: Trump’s immigration stance threatened a source of high-skilled immigrants that comprises a significant part of the industry’s work force and his trade wars threatened international sales and supply chains. This time around, tech could benefit from an anticipated loosening of antitrust regulation that discouraged big deals from getting done and threatened to rein in the power of Google, Apple and Amazon. What’s more, Trump is expected to clear the way for Big Tech to make more inroads in artificial intelligence technology — an area increasingly seen as a crucial battleground in the duel for global power between the U.S. and China. Trump’s vow to impose tariffs and other restrictions on trade does pose a potential downside for chip makers, particularly stock market darling Nvidia. A possible rollback of Biden administration efforts to boost U.S. semiconductor production also is a concern. Still, in a sign of tech’s more conciliatory attitude, Trump’s election was greeted by congratulatory posts from most of the industry’s luminaries, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. — Michael Liedtke Trump’s victory brings a big dose of uncertainty for the retail industry. Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He also wants to further cut the corporate tax rate. Those would be tailwinds for shoppers and businesses, analysts said. But the president-elect’s trade proposals could have a huge downside. He’s proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and tariffs of 10% to 20% on other imports. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, said retailers would either take a big hit on profits or be forced to increase prices. As opposed to Trump’s first term, retailers will have a harder time absorbing tariffs this time because their costs of doing business are already higher, Saunders said. Many companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year. The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher prices for U.S. shoppers if Trump’s new tariffs are implemented. For example, an $80 pair of men’s jeans would cost $90 to $96. — Anne D'Innocenzio Trump has said he wants to “drill, drill, drill” starting on Day 1 of his presidency, so it’s expected that traditional fossil fuel-focused companies will get a boost and renewable energy outfits could be disadvantaged. Oilfield services companies including Haliburton and Schlumberger would likely benefit from initiatives to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Natural gas companies including EQT and CNX Resources could benefit from facilities and pipeline projects. Meanwhile, clean energy companies, such as First Solar and many electric vehicle makers, could have a harder time growing if Trump cuts tax credits and other incentives for the industry. But remember Trump’s first term, says Austin Pickle, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The thought back then, like now, was that Trump would boost prices for oil-and-gas stocks. But energy stocks ended up struggling late in his term when the price of oil briefly went below zero during the COVID-19 pandemic. — Damian Troise Drugmakers, insurers and other health care companies could benefit from fewer regulatory roadblocks to mergers and a lighter regulatory stance overall. Insurers, in particular, may see some regulatory relief for Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of the government’s Medicare program mainly for people ages 65 and older. Under Democratic leadership, some insurers were facing smaller bonus payments tied to their Medicare Advantage plans. Some drugmakers are facing revenue hits on certain drugs covered by Medicare. Those challenges could abate under Republican rule, analysts at Morningstar noted. A second Trump administration also may challenge health care companies. The approval of drugs and vaccines could become less predictable, depending on the role anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plays, said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. Health insurers that sell coverage on the Affordable Care Act’s insurance marketplaces or manage state-and-federally funded Medicaid coverage could face challenges if Republicans attempt to dismantle parts of the law, said Julie Utterback of Morningstar. In particular, extra subsidies that help people buy marketplace coverage are slated to expire at the end of next year, which could lead to enrollment drops. — Tom Murphy The auto industry is another that should welcome less restrictive regulations but dread tariffs. Trump is likely to roll back or scrap tailpipe emissions limits for 2027 through 2032 imposed by the Biden administration. Companies like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis could more easily sell larger, less-efficient vehicles without paying hefty fines. Companies would also face less pressure to sell more electric vehicles to offset emissions from big trucks and SUVs, which make big profit margins, said Kevin Tynan, research director for The Presidio Group. Tariffs are a different story. Trump has threatened tariffs on imported vehicles to force more production in the U.S. The threat of 100% tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico is a big concern. Morningstar analyst David Whiston said such tariffs could potentially cost General Motors, Stellantis and Ford billions in profits. About 30% of GM’s North American production comes from Mexico, while it’s 24% for Stellantis and about 15% for Ford. Whiston notes that tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico would violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement negotiated during Trump’s first term. But that can be reworked in July of 2026. Whiston said those tariffs would mean higher prices and many buyers already can’t afford the current average price of over $47,000. Trump also has threatened to get rid of electric vehicle tax credits that have helped boost sales of EVs. — Tom Krisher Bank stocks could benefit if Trump's policies boost the U.S. economy and more customers apply for loans. In addition, Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo believes the Trump victory can usher in a “new era” of lighter financial regulation after 15 years of stricter oversight following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Under Biden, banks were facing requirements to set aside more capital to reduce risk, but the Trump administration is likely to take a step back. Dealmaking could see a revival under Trump, which would help banks with large investment banking operations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.

Title: How CFOs Can Adapt Their Budgeting To Today’s Economic Reality

Plus: Wall Street Looks Forward To Fewer Regulations, Republican Election Wins Rally Markets, Crypto Prices Soar, Why Tax Cuts Might Take Some Time Investors, bankers and dealmakers are celebrating Donald Trump’s election victory last week. Forbes’ Hank Tucker writes why: Republicans are known for being more business-friendly and less likely to enact strict regulations. And Donald Trump, who has made his distaste for regulations crystal clear, will have a Republican Senate and potentially a Republican House of Representatives to get his policies through. Many in the business world are hopeful Trump keeps his campaign promise of generous corporate tax cuts, and can fill the Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission with leaders who will give more flexibility to business. Regardless of who won the election, 2025 was already expected to be a return to more active financial times. Inflation has moderated, interest rates have been slashed, markets are booming and the economic climate is right for M&A, IPOs and fundraising. Tight bank regulations enacted during the global financial crisis were being eased. Those are expected to be much less onerous now. “I consider this a watershed moment in turning the page for bank regulation. The post-Global Financial Crisis period is now over,” longtime Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo told Tucker. “The pendulum had already started to swing back, but now it’s likely to swing back even more.” But while businesses expect happier days, there are also potentially dark clouds on the horizon. On the campaign trail, one of Trump’s major economic plans was drastically increasing tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S.—-potentially going as high as 100% for China or Mexico. Economists from differing philosophical backgrounds warn that would make everything more expensive for everyone in the U.S. While Trump has said this will force other countries to pay more to the U.S., Forbes’ Cyrus Farivar writes that tariffs don’t work that way in practice. Companies pass higher import duties to consumers, increasing the prices of all goods. Consumers respond by buying less. According to an analysis from the National Retail Federation, the effects of tariffs Trump’s proposal will be “dramatic,” especially since many products that are made in the U.S. use foreign-made components or materials. Some U.S. companies are scrambling to increase their imports—especially from China—to beat any tariffs before Trump takes office. Even without the presidential election, a global pandemic, supply shortages, supply chain issues, inflation and geopolitical upheaval have rapidly changed the business environment in the last five years. This has created many changes in the budgetary process. I talked with Andy West, a senior partner at McKinsey and global co-leader of its Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice, about how CFOs can adapt. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week, after the election. With Republicans’ ballot box victories came new highs for the stock market. Last week was Wall Street’s best of 2024, with all three major indexes rallying—the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.6%, the S&P 500 rose 4.7%, and the Nasdaq gained 5.7%. All three indexes continued consistent growth on Monday. The S&P crossed the 6,000 mark on Friday, and stayed there for much of Monday. But the gains were not just for the largest public companies. The Russell 2000 was up 8.5% last week. One of the companies that saw the most movement was Tesla, whose market cap passed $1 trillion on Friday for the first time since 2022. Since the election, the company’s stock is up about 35%. CEO Elon Musk’s supercharged support for Trump—both on the campaign trail and as one of his largest political donors, providing the campaign about $130 million—helped drive Tesla’s rally, which appears to be cooling off a bit today. However, Tesla isn’t the biggest Trump beneficiary on the stock market, nor is it the only one seeing its fortunes rise from Trump’s campaign trail priorities. Private prison companies CoreCivic and Geo Group—both of which are Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractors—have seen their stock up 76% and 75%, respectively. And Taser parent Axon Enterprise has seen 40% growth. Adding fuel to the economic fire was the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates by 0.25% at its meeting last week, bringing them to 4.5% to 4.75%. Unlike the market rally, the cut had nothing to do with the election. It was widely expected due to falling inflation rates—which were down to 2.1% last month, according to the Commerce Department—and a 4.1% unemployment rate. However, analysts cautioned that the Fed’s planned wind-down of interest rates, which were hiked due to high inflation that peaked in 2022, may not unfold as initially anticipated due to the uncertainty around Trump’s tariff plans. Chesnot/Getty Images Cryptocurrency is also seeing a gigantic boost from Trump’s win. Bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency, has seen its price skyrocket to more than $86,000 since Trump’s election. Trump ran as a cryptocurrency-friendly candidate, promising to fire Securities and Exchange Chairman Gary Gensler and roll back regulations on cryptocurrency at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. Trump has also said he would like to create a strategic national bitcoin reserve. With the election of blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno as a new Republican senator from Ohio—unseating former Senate Banking Committee and strict cryptocurrency regulation supporter Sen. Sherrod Brown—it could be easier for pro-cryptocurrency laws to get through Congress. Trump’s family also stands to personally benefit from looser regulations on cryptocurrency. In September, he started a new cryptocurrency business venture called World Liberty Financial. It’s run by his older sons Don Jr. and Eric. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks outside of the U.S. Capitol Building on Tuesday. With Republican control of the White House and at least the Senate, fast tax cuts are expected. Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb writes that tax cuts are likely on the way, but it may take a while before they’re reflected in what businesses are paying the government. It has to do with the budgetary processes in Congress. While Republicans will have a majority in the Senate, most bills they bring up will be able to be filibustered by Democrats—a strong likelihood in this case. A majority of senators can consider financial bills through a process called reconciliation, which has special rules. These bills can only deal with spending and revenues for a limited time, meaning they usually have to expire—which is why tax cuts from Trump’s first term are sunsetting in 2025. And even with broad agreement on the big things, it does take some time to get agreement on the details. Erb points out that the previous round of Trump tax cuts wasn’t approved until December 20, 2017, nearly a year into his term. McKinsey Senior Partner and Global Coleader of Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice Andy West. After about a decade of relative stability, the last five years have delivered financial uncertainty to companies as pandemics, supply chain issues, inflation and geopolitical upheavals have impacted businesses across the globe. That’s changed the CFO’s budgeting process significantly, and leaders who do better recognize that some of these issues should be seen as more permanent conditions, said Andy West, senior partner and coleader of McKinsey’s Global Strategy and Corporate Finance practice. I talked to him about some of the changes in the CFO’s budgeting process. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What are some of the bigger issues to address as CFOs are putting together budgets right now? West: The biggest is around granularity, in terms of how granular you need to be when making decisions. Instead of wrapping it up in a product line or a business unit, and talking about things like total revenue, as you have impacts like inflation on price, or supply chain risk on volume, [you should be] decoupling that in price and volume. What are our assumptions and how do we think about that? In a multi-business company, multiple product lines are completely affected by these risks. Some may be status quo, others might be having a massive impact on the supply chain and can no longer price or supply the way that we expected. The specificity with which budgets need to be evaluated is increasing in a lot of different ways. We also see an expansion from just financial metrics to finance and operating-driven metrics. I have a client that [is] a contract manufacturer. For them, instead of just setting budgets, they need to bound their financial budgets by what’s operationally feasible. You used to be able to say, ‘I’m just going to set a budget 10% higher than last year, and that seems right.’ Now we have to understand our aspirations for spending 10% higher than last year. Is that consistent with what’s happening with our unit costs? If you are setting a budget that is impossible to execute, you need to know that. That was not a factor before. You knew that last year was going to be the same as this year. That level of de-layering is really important. The last one that is really interesting is cadence. The annual budget cycle used to be [on a regular] cadence, which is a year. What you’re seeing now is that’s insufficient for the amount of risk and uncertainty in the world and the budget. They’re either managing that with holdbacks and then they’re releasing budgets as they go, or they’re changing the cadence and saying, we’re going to do quarterly budgeting. What is most interesting is organizations that are getting more granular are also thinking about the cycle in a more granular way. Old business, same assumptions, that’s the good old yearly cycle, and we’re going to do it the old way because the new way is more expensive and more complicated to execute. But these two strategic initiatives are going to be on a faster flywheel and we’re going to look at them in isolation in order to manage the risk. This new budgeting strategy is a departure from how things have been done in the last 10 to 15 years. But all of this uncertainty is not a unique occurrence for business in general. What time periods could CFOs learn from? There will be a handful of executives who were making business decisions in the 1970s. I think when we look at the different eras of business and economic performance, one of the things that typically draws us back to that era is [the] supply constraints that we’re dealing with right now. Supply of energy, scarce resources, less economic stability, a bit more polarization in the world. Where we are right now is a different era than the ‘70s, but if you go back to some of the fundamentals and how long it took to work through things like energy supply—which was a big problem in the ‘70s—it took years. I think that’s the situation that we’re in right now: Years to get the budgeting updated, years to pivot on strategy, years to find a way to manage around some of the global issues. I think we’re seeing a fairly resilient consumer right now, but until we work through these structural challenges, we are still going to have some uncertainty. What advice would you give to a CFO working through this process? Take it seriously. The changes you’re making now are a lot of work, but it will lead you to an inherently better place because the world’s likely not going back. These changes are a good thing. I would say keep granularity in mind. It is really important for the CFO and the finance function to help the organization understand performance and make sure that resources are being reallocated accordingly. And I would also say embrace the strategic moment. CFOs have, for the last decade, become closer and closer to general operators, and become more and more strategic. This is only a continued evolution of their role and an opportunity to lean into the moment.

Title: Amazon is taking on Nvidia with an AI freebie

Amazon (AMZN-5.22%) Web Services is looking to take on Nvidia’s (NVDA-4.19%) dominance in artificial intelligence chips with a new offer to AI researchers. The cloud computing unit of Amazon said on Tuesday that researchers who want to use its custom AI chip, Trainium, can get credits worth $110 million to use its cloud data centers as part of its Build on Trainium program. The company’s Trainium chip is used for training AI models, and is an in-house competitor to AI chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.87%). Amazon is making up to 40,000 first-generation Trainium chips available for the program, which is focused on university-led research in generative AI, and counts researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California, Berkeley. Gadi Hutt, business development lead for AI chips at AWS, told Reuters that the company is taking a different strategy from Nvidia to get developers to use its chips, and is planning to publish Trainium’s instruction set architecture so customers can program the chip directly, instead of with software, which is what Nvidia’s chips need. But despite preparations to roll out the next-generation of its in-house AI chips, Amazon “is going nowhere,” until Nvidia’s CUDA software “is no longer the control point of AI training,” and the cloud giant “iterates much faster,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. Amazon will likely launch its in-house AI inferencing chip, Inferentia, at its re:Invent conference later this year, Windsor said, but he doubts “it will make much difference” to Nvidia’s dominance. “We want to be absolutely the best place to run Nvidia,” Dave Brown, vice president of compute and networking services at AWS, told the Financial Times. “But at the same time we think it’s healthy to have an alternative.” Windsor said Brown’s statement “is indicative of Nvidia’s market power, and all of its biggest customers are trying to reduce their dependence on it for training and inference and so far, they are having very little success.” Meanwhile, Amazon is discussing another multi-billion dollar investment in AI startup, Anthropic, The Information reported. Amazon is reportedly asking Anthropic, which develops AI models rivaling those of OpenAI, to use servers powered by its in-house custom chips.

Title: 11 stocks that are soaring after Trump's election win — and why they're up

Manage your account Donald Trump’s impending return to the White House has boosted some industrial sectors he has historically championed and others he advocated for during his campaign. It’s no surprise that Tesla (TSLA) stock has been soaring since Trump’s victory given Elon Musk’s endorsement and closeness to the president-elect in recent months. In the same vein, Trump Media (DJT), the social media platform founded by the former president, is on the rise following his victory. But Tesla and Trump Media shares aren’t the only ones expected to appreciate following Trump’s victory. Other sectors likely to benefit include banking, private prisons, cryptocurrency, and the non-renewable energy industry. Here’s a look at stocks poised to thrive in a Trump 2.0 era. Shares of JPMorgan (JPM) have seen significant growth since Election Day, fueled by investor optimism that Trump’s return to the White House will usher in a period of reduced regulation. The former and now-future president has long pushed for scaling back regulations across industries. For banks, that will ease what had been growing concerns over antitrust scrutiny and looming capital requirements that have slowed both potential investment banking and lending revenues. During his campaign, Trump promised to cut the corporate tax rate from 21% to as low as 15%. Moreover, he pledged to remove Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office. Currently, JPMorgan (JPM) shares are trading at $240, reflecting an increase of more than 9% over the past week and a nearly 40% rise for the year so far. Morgan Stanley (MS) shares have surged following Trump’s victory, driven by expectations of increased bank deregulation. Currently, the stock (MS) is trading at $132, reflecting a 14% gain over the past week and a nearly 40% rise year-to-date. A more lenient approach from Trump’s antitrust regulators could pave the way for a wave of deals that seemed uncertain under the current regulatory environment. Reuters has suggested that banks may benefit from faster approval timelines in the M&A landscape. Shares of credit card companies, like Capital One (COF), surged on optimism that a proposed merger with Discover Financial Services (DFS) could finally move forward under Trump’s leadership, as it has previously faced regulatory hurdles. Currently, Capital One (COF) stock is trading at $189, reflecting a 17% gain over the past week and a nearly 43% rise year-to-date. Shares of Discover Financial Services (DFS) have been surging since Trump’s win, hoping for a smooth merger with Capital One (COF). Currently, Discover (DFS) stock is trading at $180, reflecting a 20% gain over the past week and over 60% rise year-to-date. Shares of GEO Group Inc., a company specializing in the management of private prisons and detention centers, are climbing amid expectations that Trump’s policies will lead to increased detention of migrants entering the country illegally. Late Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Tom Homan, former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and a proponent of the “zero tolerance” policy, will serve as his administration’s “border czar.” Currently, Geo Group (GEO) stock is trading at $26, reflecting an 81% gain over the past week and over 144% rise year-to-date. Shares of private prison company CoreCivic are surging post-election, as investors anticipate that a Trump administration will enforce stricter policies on immigrants entering the country illegally, driving demand for detention facilities. Currently, CoreCivic (CXW) stock is trading at $23, reflecting a 78% gain over the past week and over 65% rise year-to-date. This year, Trump emerged as a pro-crypto leader and pledged to create a Bitcoin reserve. The fact that crypto companies are thriving after his victory is not surprising. On Monday, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced it spent the first weeks of November accumulating Bitcoin. Between October 31 and November 10, the company purchased 27,200 Bitcoin for approximately $2.03 billion, at an average price of $74,463 per Bitcoin. This latest acquisition brings MicroStrategy’s total holdings to 279,420 Bitcoin, valued at nearly $24 billion at current market prices. Currently, MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock is trading at $340, reflecting a 45% gain over the past week and a 396% rise year-to-date. Coinbase (COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., was one of the leading crypto companies advocating for a crypto-friendly government. Following the confirmation of Trump’s victory, CEO Brian Armstrong took to X to share data indicating that the upcoming Senate and House of Representatives will have a majority pro-crypto congresspeople. Currently, Coinbase (COIN) stock is trading at $324, reflecting a 74% gain over the past week and a 106% rise year-to-date. During his speech at the Bitcoin conference, Trump said Bitcoin “is the steel of the future,” and he wants it to be “mined, minted, and made” on American soil. He met with executives from prominent crypto mining firms, listening to their challenges and discussing ways to enhance the industry’s growth. This pro-crypto stance has sent a surge of optimism through the industry, especially among major crypto mining companies like MARA Holdings Inc. (formerly Marathon Digital Holdings) (MARA). Currently, MARA Holdings (MARA) stock is trading at $25, reflecting a 56% gain over the past week and a 9% rise year-to-date. It is generally expected that Trump will favor policies that would benefit American oil companies. Non-renewable energy stocks, which provide services to the oil and energy industry, performed well after his victory. EQT (EQT), a natural gas producer that engages in hydrocarbon exploration and pipeline transport, has surged since Trump’s win. Currently, EQT (EQT) stock is trading at $44, reflecting a 44% gain over the past week and a 13% rise year-to-date. Baker Hughes (BKR) (BKR), an energy technology company, also surged after Trump’s victory in the election. Currently, Baker Hughes (BKR) is trading at $44, up 10% over the last week and up over 30% for the year so far. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) pleaded with fellow Republicans to back Donald Trump’s choice as attorney general, Matt Gaetz, after initially sounding skeptical about the bombshell pick. Appearing on Fox News’ Hannity on Wednesday, Graham said: “To every Republican, give Matt a chance.” His remark came amid a growing rebellion from GOP ranks over the surprise decision. Several Republican senators openly showed their disdain, saying it wasn’t a “serious” appointment. Republican senators are warning that former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s (R-Fla.) nomination to serve as President-elect Trump’s attorney general is in serious trouble, even though Republicans will control 53 seats in the upper chamber next year.

So, if it’s… Naughty List While Elon Musk and president-elect Donald Trump are apparently closer than ever, the famously mercurial Trump seems to be growing weary of Musk's clinginess. "Elon won’t go home. I can’t get rid of him," Trump teased at a Capitol Hill meeting on Wednesday, as reported by The Hill. "Until I don’t like him." […] Jesse Watters Primetime host boasted of his ties to some of those headed for the most powerful jobs in government Within minutes of President-elect Donald Trump’s announcement of Fox News host and Army veteran Pete Hegseth as his selection for Secretary of Defense, current and former senior military commanders began messaging and calling me with their reactions. “Ridiculous,” said one. “An effing (euphemism inserted) nightmare,” said another. To be clear, these were not partisans, but senior commanders who have served under both Presidents Trump and Joe Biden. The tech sector is full of bulletproof stocks -- but these two are a cut above. Alyssa Farah Griffin says she urged Gaetz not to present Trump with the "printed out conspiracy theories" about Joe Scarborough. Former national security adviser John Bolton said Wednesday that former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) and Rep.

There is a list of investors that you might call Wall Street legends, and sitting near the top (if not at the very head of the list) is Warren Buffett. Buffett is the chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), a stock that hasn't just beaten the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the long term, it has trounced it. What has Berkshire Hathaway done?

Electric vehicle (EV) maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) said late Tuesday that it closed a hugely important deal, in which giant Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY) will invest billions in the California-based upstart. The Volkswagen deal ensures that Rivian will have ample cash to launch its smaller, higher-volume R2 and R3 models -- and opens up a potentially lucrative new market for its technology. In a nutshell, Rivian and Volkswagen have formed a joint venture that will take the technology Rivian is developing for its upcoming R2 model and adapt it for some of Volkswagen's upcoming electric vehicles.

Title: These Closed-End Funds Pay $1,000 A Month On Every $100K Invested

A pile of one hundred US banknotes with president portraits. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve mentioned closed-end funds (CEFs) to investors and been met with blank stares in return. It’s too bad more people don’t know about these powerful income plays because … Personally, I think the most powerful thing about CEFs is the Point #2. But I know that investors—including CEF Insider members—tend to favor Point #3. And I get it. After all, thanks to CEFs’ big income streams, we can re-create a middle-class salary with much less than we’d need with index funds, literally shaving decades off the time we’d need to save enough to stop working. Nest Eggs This table shows us that because the average S&P 500 stock yields so little—around 1.2% on average as I write this—we’d need to save an absurd amount, nearly $8.5 million, to get $100,000 in annual income. You could opt instead for the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD), which lowers the savings level to $2.5 million, thanks to its 4% current yield. But thanks to the average CEF’s big yields, CEFs get you there with just half that amount. We can take this even further. Some CEFs are currently yielding 12%, meaning you’ll get $1,000 per month for every $100,000 you invest. An annual six-figure income means you’d have to save just $833,333. Plus, there are some funds that can get you this amount of yield while being even more diversified than you’d be with SPY or SPYD. Let me show you three funds that easily create this kind of yield, while providing diversification across asset classes—something S&P 500 index funds can’t do. The Gabelli Utility Trust (GUT) has a portfolio of utility companies across the country—giants like Duke Energy (DUK) and Florida-based NextEra Energy (NEE). With GUT, we’re essentially getting a slice of the energy bills paid by residents in cities and counties across the nation. That’s as predictable a revenue stream as you’ll find, and as a result, GUT has maintained its high payouts—currently yielding an even 12%—since the 1990s. GUT Dividend Back in the 2000s, GUT paid some special dividends and briefly hiked its payout to six cents a share monthly, up from five cents at its IPO (which is its current payout). But the fund has held back on special dividends to focus on consistency. That’s great for income investors, but it also means GUT has become incredibly popular. Most CEFs trade at a discount, but GUT trades at a really, really high premium—nearly 53% at the moment! That’s incredibly high for a CEF, and it poses risks if you want to hold GUT for the shorter term, then get out. That’s a problem our second fund doesn’t have. Convertible bonds aren’t well-known, but they’re fascinating income plays: You get a high yield, like a bond, but there’s also a conversion privilege. So if the price is right, you can convert your bonds into stock and get capital gains if the stock rises. One fund that collects these bonds and converts when it’s ideal is the Advent Convertible and Income Fund (AVK), currently yielding 12.3% and paying out every month. That spike you see in the chart below is a special dividend paid out in late 2021. AVK Dividend But despite that high yield and consistent payout, AVK trades at a 7.1% discount, which is a sea change from the 6% premium it saw earlier this year. Investors do this to CEFs every once in a while, and it’s happened three times with AVK in the last three years. Higher interest rates have boosted demand for debt from investors, and AVK has benefited with more investment income that management has used to maintain its monthly payout after hiking it back in 2017. High, steady payouts and a discount? Need I say more? In case I do, check out AVK’s widely diversified portfolio: AVK Holdings This fund holds bonds and stocks in Bank of America (BAC), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Western Digital Corp. (WDC), Uber Technologies (UBER) and other high-quality companies that have no problem paying their bills on time. And those bills accrue to AVK, which passes on those interest payments to investors. Finally we’re going to pick up the 11.3%-yielding (not a typo!) PAXS, which holds a diversified portfolio of 325 high-yield corporate bonds. As the name states, this is a PIMCO fund. PIMCO is a well-respected name in CEFs, as the firm is known for its active management and its ability to effectively navigate interest-rate changes and seek out undervalued bonds. PAXS Dividend PAXS has only been around since January 2022, which was lousy timing for the fund to hit the market, given the hit that bonds took as interest rates rose that year. But it’s still returned around 12% in that time. Its dividend has also risen, with a special payout in late 2022, as you can see in the chart above. While PAXS trades at a 2.7% premium to NAV, that’s not unusual for PIMCO funds, which often trade at bigger premiums due to PIMCO’s strong record. And this one has traded at premiums as high as 9% in recent months, a good sign for future gains. The final word? Beyond this trio, there are many more CEFs trading at discounts and with similar yields, meaning you can combine a 12% yield with capital gains. That might help you save years, or even decades, off your planned retirement date. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Something Deeper Than Control Is Driving Restrictive Work Mandates

white color theme modern style office with exposed concrete floor and a lot of plant, 3d rendering Despite overwhelming research that shorter work weeks and remote working are good for productivity, there is still a debate between employees and employers on where and how they work. Spotify made headlines recently for reaffirming its work-from-anywhere policy, proclaiming that "our employees aren't children." So, why do we still have so many return-to-office (RTO) advocates, such as Amazon? "It's a power play between the employer and the employee about return to office mandates or shorter working weeks. And I think a lot of it is coming down to a sense of control," says Dr. Dale Whelehan, a behavioral scientist and CEO at 4 Day Week Global. While many have surmised that control is the real reason leaders are stubborn to change outdated working models, Whelehan's comment tunes into a more interesting undercurrent: the shifting dynamic between employee and employer. It is indeed a power play; a power play with two dramatic elements beyond control: trust and loyalty. "It's a challenging economic climate, and companies' default is to assume that the worker is the one that's the problem. Therefore, they want to bring the worker back in and monitor and evaluate their outcomes to try and improve productivity through that manner," Whelehan says. The problem with that is that all the research — too numerous to cite here — points to these restrictive mandates having the exact opposite effect. "All of these policies to revoke flexibility and autonomy is going to perpetuate further burnout." Businesses aren't following the data — they're following their gut instinct instead. But what worked 20 years ago won't work today. Why? Because trust is broken. Whelehan makes the point that back in the day, workers were happy to come in five days a week in exchange for stability. They knew if they were loyal, they could have a job for life if they wanted. Now, employees see regular stories of mass layoffs and realize that the majority of businesses are going to put profit before people. No longer is a track record of good performance enough for job security. So, in exchange for that lack of stability, employees want more flexibility. "It's a world of survival where people are constantly trading off money versus time," he says. Why is flexible working linked to better business performance? It’s simple — burnout. "Burnout has risen exponentially. We can't deny that people are reporting higher levels of stress, full stop." Whelehan links that stress to the fact that our current working model hasn't been updated for modern gender dynamics and economic realities. "It's no longer just the man going to work and coming home and having his meal prepared for him by his wife. That system worked before, but that's not the lived existence of the workforce now. It is now a dual-income household who is expected to work above and beyond, who has to pay for childcare, and is expected to commute longer distances to their workplaces because they can no longer afford to live in urban areas," he says. Managers and companies must evolve beyond outdated mindsets to remain competitive. "I think management is stuck in this paradigm of thinking from a hundred years ago that is not married to the skills that we're trying to actually develop within the workforce," says Whelehan. "And it's because we're fundamentally misfiring on the management side." 4 Day Week Global helps organizations trial the right flexible working model for the context in which they operate. One of the key activities to make the pilot successful beyond its fixed term is gathering the right before and after data, such as turnover, revenue, productivity, and self-reported measures of well-being. It's showing examples of where it's worked in a company/region similar to your own to build that social proof. Whelehan advises that it is the socialization of the successes that create a groundswell of motivation to try a new philosophy of work. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Tesla Stock Dips 2% As Post-Election Surge Cools Off

Shares of Tesla slipped Tuesday as part of a broader cooling off among the hottest trades following last week’s election of Donald Trump, though the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker remains far more valuable than it was prior to Election Day. People look at a Cybertruck at a Tesla dealership in Manhattan. Tesla stock fell 6%, its first daily loss since last Monday. That pares Tesla’s post-election gain to a still eye-popping 31%, as investors flooded into the stock following Trump’s victory on optimism about what Musk’s close alliance with Trump would mean for Tesla. “The magnitude” of Tesla stock’s post-election surge “surprised us,” Deutsche Bank analysts led by Edison Yu remarked in a Tuesday note to clients. Accompanying Tesla’s slip Tuesday were losses for some other assets which rallied after the Trump win. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase lost 2%, the stock of Axon Enterprise, the Taser stun gun parent which was the only S&P 500 company to outperform Tesla from Election Day through Monday, dipped 3%, private prison companies CoreCivic and Geo Group sank more than 5% apiece and analytics-focused defense contractor Palantir slipped 1%. Major indexes were only down slightly, with the S&P and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both losing less than 0.3%. “Elon Musk’s emergence from a political ‘outsider’ to having a voice in potential policies may, at some level, accelerate Tesla’s journey beyond autos,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a Tuesday note to clients. American leadership in Tesla’s core ambitions like electric and autonomous vehicles, solar energy and robotics “is going to involve government and industrial partnership on a scale some have compared to the Manhattan Project, US Highway Act or the Apollo Missions,” Jonas added. Musk’s net worth fell by about $12 billion Tuesday as Tesla shares fell. His $308 billion net worth is still more than $75 billion higher than the next-wealthiest person in the world, Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, while Musk is still almost $50 billion richer than he was before the election. Tesla added more than $340 billion in market value in the week ending Monday, eclipsing a $1 trillion market capitalization for the first time since April 2022 in the process. Yu outlined several near-term factors behind the surge, including “retail exuberance” and short trade unwinding “due to lack of near-term negative catalysts.” But Yu wrote there are “potential large” benefits for Tesla under a Trump regime with Musk a close advisor, including “streamlining” regulatory approval of Tesla’s self-driving cars and the potential for Tesla to secure further market share in the U.S. with the potential cutback of federal tax credits for electric vehicles. Tesla stock led a broader rally for U.S. equities since the election, with the S&P up 4% over the last week, trading above 6,000 for the first time ever as Wall Street celebrated the positive earnings impact of the lower corporate tax rates backed by Trump.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Many Americans use the stock market to build wealth and achieve financial freedom. In 2022, roughly 60% of U.S. households had some stock exposure and the share of Americans trading stocks directly rose to 21% from 2001. But not everyone who invests in stocks becomes wealthy. Investing requires patience, research and wisdom. Let's look at a success story for inspiration and ideas. In July last year, an investor shared his success story, detailed portfolio and tips on r/Dividends, a discussion board on Reddit with over 600,000 members. Don't Miss: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. From $25k to $438K Portfolio and $20,000 in Dividends The investor said he started investing at the age of 44 with $25,000. At the time of his post, he was 50 and his portfolio value had reached $438,000. But that's not it. He had about $20,100 in estimated dividend income from his portfolio. "Wish I’d have started when I was 20, I’d be retired now. Remember it's never too late to start so don't give up," he said. The investor said his income averaged about $60,000 to $100,000 per year, but his expenses were low, at around $2,000 per month. He said he always managed to "dump" extra cash in the stock market. "I sold anything in my home I didn't need and put the money into the portfolio. You'll be surprised what you can sell on FB Marketplace. I also put an ad on Craigslist saying I would take anything for free. I sold some things people gave me for a few hundred $'s and added this to the portfolio." Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! He also shared details on his contributions during the discussion: "Some years I was able to put away up to $35k per year, other years less. I bought index funds and oil stocks at first; my dividends weren't at the forefront because I didn't know any better. Once I had built up a portfolio and interest rates rose, I moved some money from riskier oil stocks to VTI and VUSXX." Portfolio Value Doubled Thanks to ‘Stupid Risks' In Oil Stocks But how did his portfolio go from $25,000 to $438,000? In addition to compounding, the investor's risky bets paid off. "I managed to double my portfolio by taking some stupid risks in oil stocks that happened to work out well. Could have quite easily gone the other way," he said while answering a question. The investor advised Redditors to start investing from whatever they had, even with $50 and let the compounding effect work over the long run. However, he urged investors not to forget the real goal of investing and the purpose of money. Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. "We spend too much time becoming financially agitated thinking about money. My friend died of cancer at 41 years old and didn't enjoy anything he had saved throughout his working life. Yes, be responsible but enjoy yourself." He said that since he started investing late, he took high risks, invested in oil and tech stocks and kept taking profits, with a goal of early retirement. However, he was now investing in a money-market fund to enjoy high yields. "I've owned lots of traditional dividend stocks like AT&T, Verizon and XOM over the years but now I'm heavily in the safety of VUSXX route for now while it's paying 5%." The investor shared detailed screenshots of his portfolio. Let's examine some of his biggest positions. Trending: Wondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund The Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund (VUSXX) is a money-market fund that gives investors exposure to U.S. Treasury securities. It was the biggest holding of the investor, whose portfolio went from $25,000 to $438,000. The Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund invests in short-term treasuries and yields about 5.7% as of August. It's another suitable fund for investors in search of stable monthly income. VUSXX accounted for about 67% of the investor’s total portfolio. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF Shares (VTI) made up about 20% of the investor’s portfolio. VTI tracks the total stock market, exposing investors to small, mid- and large-cap stocks. About 69% of the fund is allocated to large-cap stocks. The fund’s portfolio includes more than 3,600 stocks. Among the top holdings of the ETF are Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Amazon. SPDR Gold Trust SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was the third-largest position of the investor, who saw his portfolio rise from $25,000 to $438,000 and reach $20,000 in annual dividend income. The ETF provides investors with direct exposure to gold’s price movements without physically holding gold bars or coins. It is up about 34% over the past year. The Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund ETF The Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VWO) is a suitable option for those looking to gain exposure to emerging markets like China, Taiwan, South Africa and Brazil. VWO tracks the FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index. It also pays quarterly dividends and yields about 2%. Some of the fund’s biggest holdings include Taiwan Semiconductor, PDD Holdings, Infosys and Alibaba, among many others. Trending: During market downturns, investors are learning that unlike equities, these high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% are protected by resilient assets, buffering against losses. Kaleyra Inc. The investor, whose portfolio worth increased from $25,000 to $438,000, had mobile communication services company Kaleyra in his portfolio. In June, Tata Communications announced it would acquire the company for $100 million and debt. Tata completed the acquisition in October and Kaleyra is no longer a publicly listed company. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF: VTSAX) was the sixth-biggest holding of the investor, whose portfolio worth rose to $438,000 from $25,000. The ETF exposes investors to the entire U.S. stock market, including small-, mid- and large-cap stocks. Its portfolio consists of more than 3,600 stocks. The fund pays quarterly dividends and yields about 1.2%. Apple The investor, who earns about $20,000 in annual dividend income and has a portfolio of $438,000, said Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was part of his portfolio. Apple shares have gained about 250% over the past five years and the company has a dividend yield of 0.4%. Deutsche Bank German banking company Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) is another notable dividend stock in the investor’s portfolio who saw his portfolio jump from $25,000 to $438,000. The stock has a dividend yield of about 2.9%. Vermilion Energy Vermilion Energy Inc. (NYSE:VET) is a Canadian oil and gas producer with a dividend yield of about 3.5%. The company posted third-quarter results earlier this month. Revenue in the period rose 3.1% year over year. Cenovus Energy Cenovus Energy Inc.

To explore the cost-effectiveness of midomafetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) compared to placebo with therapy (PT) in US healthcare settings. A health state-transition model was used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-AT for treating patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity. Both treatment arms consisted of 3 preparation (90-min), 3 interventional (8-h), and 9 integration (90-min) sessions, lasting ~4 months total. All sessions included psychotherapy, with interventional also including MDMA or placebo. After receiving treatment, patients were distributed across health states of No PTSD (not meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria), Non-Severe PTSD (treatment responders), Severe PTSD (treatment non-responders), and death. Each state had unique healthcare costs and utilities sourced from real-world data analysis and patient data from MDMA-AT clinical trials (including long-term follow-up). The base-case analysis considered the payer’s perspective with a 5-year horizon, 3.5% annual cost and effect discounts, and an assumed MDMA medication price of $12,000 per session. Trial-derived utilities and US life tables mortality data were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The main outcome was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with a $150,000 willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. The base-case ICER was $83,845 per QALY. Total direct costs were $64,745 in the MDMA-AT and $33,132 in the PT arms ($31,613 increment). The costs of intervention were $48,376 for MDMA-AT and $12,376 for PT. The highest MDMA medication cost to fit under the WTP threshold was $20,314 per session. Costs related to PTSD healthcare visits and other PTSD treatments were lower with MDMA-AT than PT (-$2,511 and -$1,877 increments, respectively). Utility benefits were higher in MDMA-AT than PT, with 3.691 and 3.314 QALYs generated over 5 years, respectively (0.377 QALY increment). These data suggest MDMA-AT may be a cost-effective treatment compared to PT for patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represents a psychiatric syndrome caused by exposure to different types of traumatic events, mostly related to war, sexual abuse, or natural disasters [1]. Studies have shown that the annual PTSD prevalence rate in the US population is up to 9.1% among civilians and 50.2% among military personnel [2]. Not all individuals who are exposed to trauma develop PTSD; onset depends on the nature and severity of trauma and the duration of trauma-related symptoms. However, some population subgroups are more prone to developing PTSD, such as females, those facing childhood adversities, patients with mental health conditions, and individuals with low socioeconomic status or a lack of social support [3]. Chronic PTSD is diagnosed when the traumatized patient fails to recover from a traumatic event and is frequently followed by depression, anxiety, and substance abuse [1, 3]. PTSD is associated with high economic and long-term health outcome burden. The incremental economic burden of US individuals with PTSD compared to those without PTSD in 2018 was estimated at $19.6 thousand per patient. The excess expenditures were also higher among military personnel than civilians ($25.7 thousand and $18.6 thousand per patient, respectively). Additionally, PTSD diagnosis is associated with an increased premature mortality risk of approximately 1.2 times in US civilians and 1.8 times in the US military population [4]. Treatment options for the clinical management of PTSD include psychotherapies and pharmacological interventions [1]. Psychotherapy helps patients cope with and overcome trauma, while medications from different pharmacological classes are used to reduce symptom severity associated with PTSD and other comorbid mental health conditions [1, 5]. Clinical guidelines also consider the augmentation of psychotherapy with pharmacological interventions [6]. However, there are still many challenges associated with PTSD treatments. Available pharmacotherapies used to treat PTSD symptoms typically require long-term use to maintain clinical benefits. This often results in the occurrence of adverse events, leading to treatment discontinuation and worsening symptoms [7]. Additionally, some first-line psychotherapies and pharmacological interventions have shown high treatment failure rates in clinical trials, with many patients retaining PTSD symptoms and frequent dropout [8]. Midomafetamine used in combination with psychological intervention (MDMA-AT) is an investigational treatment approach being evaluated by Lykos Therapeutics for adult patients with PTSD. Although the exact mechanism of action is unclear, it is hypothesized that the synergistic effects of combined midomafetamine and manualized psychotherapy treatment more directly impact pathological PTSD mechanisms rather than only suppressing the symptoms. By affecting the serotoninergic activity in the left amygdala, midomafetamine is thought to alter the trauma processing in PTSD patients by attenuating fear, reducing reactions to stress triggers, eliminating chronic hyperarousal, and decreasing defensiveness without blocking access to memories or preventing a deep and genuine experience of emotion. The effects of midomafetamine is therefore proposed to augment manualized psychotherapy during MDMA-AT sessions [9, 10]. Phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reported significant efficacy of investigational MDMA-AT compared to placebo with therapy in terms of reducing symptom severity in participants with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity. The treatment course consisted of only three MDMA sessions in combination with psychological intervention and close patient observations. Adverse events that occurred were typically transient, mild to moderate severity, and promptly managed [11, 12]. The challenges of current PTSD treatments suggest the need for novel clinical interventions to treat patients. MDMA-AT demonstrates the potential to address this unmet need in the current PTSD treatment landscape. Although efficacy and safety were shown in clinical trials, the cost-effectiveness of this intervention remains unclear. This health economic model aims to explore the cost-effectiveness of the MDMA-AT for treating patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity in the US healthcare setting. Model development and reporting of findings are aligned with the updated Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist [13]. The research is based on the principles of mathematical modeling, published peer-reviewed literature, publicly available US statistics, and de-identified clinical trial data. The study does not require ethics board approval as there are no relevant or potential conflicts with ethical principles in medicine and research. Clinical trial data supporting the study findings were used under license from Lykos Therapeutics and are publicly unavailable. Data access may be granted by the authors upon reasonable request and gained approval from Lykos Therapeutics. Any data that might be shared would be released via a data use agreement. The model development and cost-effectiveness analysis were performed using Microsoft Office Excel® software (version Office 365). Clinical trial data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics® software (version 23.0). A health state transition economic model with a cost-effectiveness analysis was developed from the payer perspective. The modeling time frame was 25 years with implemented annual cycles. The model population included patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher disease severity. The treatment included three interventional MDMA-AT sessions as well as preparation and integration psychotherapy sessions based on clinical trial protocols [9, 11, 12]. Briefly, participants received three 90-minute preparation psychotherapy sessions prior to the first MDMA-AT session. Each interventional MDMA-AT session lasted 8 hours and consisted of MDMA administration, psychotherapy, and close patient monitoring by two trained therapists. MDMA was administered as a split dose of 80 mg and 40 mg (120 mg total) during the first MDMA-AT session and as a split dose of 120 mg and 60 mg (180 mg total) in the second and third sessions. MDMA-AT treatment sessions were spaced approximately four weeks apart followed by three weekly 90-minute integration sessions comprised of psychotherapy alone with two therapists. For all preparation, interventional, and integration sessions, a manualized psychotherapy approach was used. Manualized psychotherapy is inner-directed and designed to invite inquiry and facilitate a therapeutic effect by providing support for approaching difficult material that does not interfere with the participant’s spontaneous experience. The model comparator was identical to the protocol used in the MDMA-AT arm including manualized psychotherapy, but patients were administered placebo instead of MDMA during the interventional sessions. The modeling was based on data from MAPP1 and MAPP2 studies–two randomized, double-blind, phase III clinical trials comparing MDMA-AT to placebo with therapy administration in participants with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher disease severity [11, 12]. After completing the phase III trials, some participants were included in the long-term follow-up study (MPLONG) which was used to estimate the durability of treatment effects. Model health states were No PTSD, Non-severe PTSD, Severe PTSD, and death. At model initiation, all patients had moderate or higher severity PTSD; therefore, they were classified in the Non-severe or Severe PTSD health states. After receiving treatment with MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy (4-month post-treatment endpoint), patients transitioned to other health states based on the treatment response: Loss of PTSD diagnosis in clinical trials was defined as not meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria after treatment according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and measured using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5). Treatment response was defined as a clinically relevant CAPS-5 score decrease of at least 10 points. As such, more effective treatment would be depicted by a higher rate of patients in the No PTSD state, while less effective treatment would show higher rates of patients with Non-severe and Severe PTSD. The durability of treatment effects was assessed in the follow-up MPLONG study of MAPP1 and MAPP2 participants. Data from this long-term observational study were analyzed to obtain transitioning rates between the model states at the MPLONG endpoint by applying the previously explained criteria. The mean follow-up duration in the MPLONG trial was 17 months for participants with moderate or higher severity PTSD. Patient distribution among health states at the 1-year endpoint was estimated using distribution data at trial enrollment, the 4-month post-treatment endpoint, and the 17-month long-term follow-up endpoint. The proportion of patients in the No PTSD state treated with MDMA-AT at these endpoints was graphically represented with the proportion of sample as the y-axis and time in months as the x-axis. Using the best-fit method (log model), proportions were extrapolated over time and extracted for a 1-year time point. The difference between the proportions of patients in the No PTSD state at the estimated time point and a previous time point was equally distributed between the Non-severe and Severe PTSD states. The patient distribution at the 1-year time point was employed for the first annual cycle, while distribution of patients extracted from the MPLONG trial was used for all other consecutive model cycles (from 2nd annual cycle to the maximum 25th annual cycle) due to the lack of data in the literature. The same method was used to estimate transitioning rates between the model health states among patients treated with the placebo with therapy comparator. Briefly, the model started when the target population initiated the treatment with MDMA-AT or the placebo with therapy comparator. After the treatment course (4 months for the MAPP1 and MAPP2 trials), patients were stratified into one of the health states (No PTSD, Non-severe PTSD, and Severe PTSD). Each state had its own PTSD treatment costs, healthcare visit costs, utilities, and mortality rates. Afterwards, patients were observed over the long-term follow-up (MPLONG trial) and redistributed across health states based on the changes in their health status. Healthcare costs, utilities, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at relevant endpoints were calculated. The full model scheme diagram is shown in Fig 1.

Healthcare cost inputs were pooled from a PTSD burden of illness (BOI) study based on real-world evidence data. The cohorts in the BOI analysis match the model health states (No PTSD = Baseline PTSD, Non-severe PTSD = PTSD without comorbidities, and Severe PTSD = PTSD with comorbidities). PTSD economic burden and treatment characteristics in the BOI analysis were assessed during the 2-year follow-up period [15]. Healthcare costs included three components: intervention treatment costs (MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy), healthcare visits for PTSD, and regular PTSD treatments (psychotherapy or medication). Intervention costs were one-time expenditures in the model paid for MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy. According to the clinical trial protocols [11, 12], there were three interventional sessions (MDMA or placebo administration with 8-hour psychotherapy) with a total of nine integration and three preparation 90-minute psychotherapy sessions provided by two therapists. Hence, the MDMA-AT intervention cost was the sum of three preparation psychotherapy sessions, three MDMA-AT sessions (which included the estimated MDMA medication price plus eight hours of psychotherapy), and nine integration psychotherapy sessions. The comparator intervention cost included only expenditures related to the psychotherapy components (three preparation, three placebo with therapy, and nine integration sessions). The cost of a single preparation or integration session was pooled from the BOI analysis using an average 90-minute psychotherapy session cost multiplied by two (the number of therapists per session). The cost of a single 8-hour session (480 minutes) was estimated from a 90-minute psychotherapy cost input by multiplying with a time coefficient (480 minutes divided by 90 minutes) and the number of therapists (2 therapists). The second cost component represents healthcare expenditures associated with PTSD services provided in outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department (ED) settings. PTSD-related visit costs per cohort from BOI analysis were used to estimate the average monthly cost of PTSD-related healthcare services per model health state. To calculate the PTSD visit costs for MDMA-AT and the placebo with therapy comparator, the monthly PTSD visit costs per health state were multiplied by the rate of patients in each health state that received respective intervention treatment and summed per model arm. The average monthly PTSD visit costs were multiplied by the annual rate (12, for the total number of months) to estimate PTSD visit expenditures per model cycle, and then multiplied by model endpoint duration (i.e., 1-year, 5-year, 10-year…) to determine the total PTSD visit costs. The final component of healthcare costs was regular PTSD treatment expenditures including psychotherapy, FDA-approved medications, and off-label medications. Psychotherapy utilization rates and the number of sessions per month were extracted from the MPLONG data. The monthly psychotherapy cost per model state was calculated using monthly utilization data from MPLONG and the average cost of psychotherapy sessions from the BOI analysis. Medication utilization rates were not available from the MPLONG data and were therefore determined from BOI analysis. The monthly medication expenditures (FDA-approved and off-label separately) were estimated using the utilization rates per cohort and 2-year costs related to the medication group from BOI analysis. The 2-year medication group costs were divided by 24 months to estimate a mean cost on a monthly level. The monthly PTSD treatment costs for model health states were the sum of monthly psychotherapy, FDA-approved medication, and off-label medication expenditures per respective state. The same method as for the PTSD visit costs was applied to calculate monthly PTSD treatment costs per model arm (MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy) using the results per health state. Since other PTSD treatments were not allowed during the MAPP1 and MAPP2 trials, PTSD treatment costs were not included in the calculation while patients were receiving MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy sessions (until the end of the 4th month in the model). Health-related utility values were measured with the European Quality of Life—5 Dimension—5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) tool in MAPP1, MAPP2, and MPLONG trials. Using the post-treatment and long-term follow-up results for each health state per study arm, the 1-year values were estimated by applying the previously explained modeling method. The utility values for MDMA-AT were derived by summarizing the multiplied results of patient distribution across health states in the intervention arm and utility values per each health state in the same arm. The calculation was also applied to gain utility estimates for the placebo with therapy comparator at all endpoints. The base-case analysis included patients with PTSD of moderate or higher disease severity, the economic burden from the payer’s perspective, a 5-year modeling time horizon, and 3.5% annual discount rates on cost and utility inputs. A brief description of all model input parameters and relevant data sources for base-case analysis are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313569.t001 Discount rates of 3.5% per year of modeling were applied to cost and utility inputs. The pre-defined willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was $150,000. ICER was the main study outcome, calculated as the ratio of healthcare costs increment and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) increment between MDMA-AT and psychotherapy. Abbreviations: ICER–Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; MDMA-AT–MDMA-assisted therapy; PT–placebo with therapy; QALY–Quality-adjusted life years Univariate one-way sensitivity analysis (OWSA) was implemented in the model to denote which input parameters had the greatest impact on study findings. By varying input values in a specified range (±10%), the impact of each parameter was presented in a tornado chart. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) assessed the reliability of study findings by showing the impact of uncertainty regarding model inputs. By running a high number of iterations (varying input values 5,000 times according to the assigned data distribution), the results were reported as the ICER of mean cost increment and mean QALY increment, a scatter plot of all cost and QALY increments (each dot representing the result of a single simulation), and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Scenario analysis with a goal-seek function was also implemented in the model. This analysis calculated the maximum MDMA-AT session cost at which the ICER is equal to the WTP threshold. It also provided ICER values for decreasing MDMA-AT cost per session estimate. The base-case analysis ICER (patients with PTSD of moderate and higher severity, payer perspective, 5-year horizon, and 3.5% annual cost and utility discounts) is $83,845 per QALY. MDMA-AT is a cost-effective treatment compared to the placebo with therapy comparator in the base-case setting. The cost of MDMA-AT treatment was $48,376 ($36,000 for MDMA and $12,376 for all psychotherapy components of MDMA-AT), with a $16,125 price for a single MDMA-AT session ($12,000 for MDMA, $2,357 for 8-hour psychotherapy, and $1,768 for preparation and integration sessions). The total cost of the placebo with therapy was $12,376. Total direct PTSD costs over a 5-year time horizon were $64,745 for the MDMA-AT arm and $33,132 for the placebo with therapy arm ($31,612 incremental cost). The cost difference was mainly driven by the intervention costs, with a much higher cost in MDMA-AT than in placebo with therapy ($48,376 and $12,376, respectively). However, MDMA-AT had lower costs related to PTSD visits ($4,831 compared to $7,342 in placebo with therapy) and PTSD treatment expenditures ($11,538 compared to $13,414 in placebo with therapy). Unlike the healthcare costs, utility outcomes were more beneficial for MDMA-AT than placebo with therapy (3.691 QALY vs. 3.314 QALY, respectively). The cost-effectiveness chart using the base-case scenario and $150,000 WTP threshold is presented in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313569.g002 OWSA with a 10% variation rate denoted utility inputs as parameters with the highest impact on findings. Lowering MDMA-AT utility in the No PTSD category for 2–25 model cycles by 10% yielded an ICER of $247,773 per QALY, while increasing the value by 10% provided an ICER of $50,460 per QALY. After varying MDMA-AT utility in the No PTSD category for the first model cycle by +10% or -10%, ICER values were $71,549 and $101,243 per QALY, respectively. Univariate OWSA findings are presented in Fig 3. Abbreviations: ICER–incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; MDMA-AT–MDMA-assisted therapy; PT–placebo with therapy; PTSD–Post-traumatic stress disorder. Abbreviations: ICER–incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; MDMA-AT–MDMA-assisted therapy; PT–placebo with therapy; PTSD–Post-traumatic stress disorder. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313569.g003 PSA was performed with 5,000 iterations. The mean direct PTSD expenditures for base-case analysis were $64,805 in the MDMA-AT arm and $33,106 in the placebo with therapy arm, yielding a mean cost increment of $31,699 (±5,378 standard deviation). The average QALY increment was 0.376 (±0.305 standard deviation) with mean utilities of 3.691 in the MDMA-AT arm and 3.315 in the placebo with therapy arm. The estimated ICER using the mean increments was $84,240 per QALY. These findings were consistent with the main results, establishing the cost-effectiveness superiority of MDMA-AT over the placebo with therapy comparator. The acceptability of MDMA-AT compared to placebo with therapy was 72.12% at the $150,000 WTP threshold and 60.16% at the $100,000 WTP threshold. PSA findings are presented as scatter plot (Fig 4) and cost-effectiveness acceptability diagrams (Fig 5). Abbreviations: QALY–Quality-adjusted life years; WTP–Willingness-to-pay.

Abbreviations: WTP–Willingness-to-pay. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313569.g005 Scenario analysis calculated the maximum MDMA medication cost per session with the base-case analysis ICER equal to the pre-defined WTP threshold. It was demonstrated that a maximum MDMA medication price of $20,314 per session yielded an ICER of $149,998 per QALY, meeting a WTP threshold of $150,000. Besides the maximum price, scenario analysis provided an overview of ICER value distribution at lower MDMA medication costs. The maximum MDMA medication price to fit under the $100,000 WTP threshold was $14,030 per session, while $7,746 per session was a maximum cost for WTP threshold of $50,000. This cost-effectiveness analysis estimated the healthcare costs per QALY in patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity, comparing MDMA-AT and placebo with therapy. Model inputs were based on data from three clinical trials (two phase III and one long-term follow-up), a real-world economic BOI analysis, and treatment patterns in modern clinical practice to minimize assumptions and provide the most accurate price estimate. The analysis yielded a cost of $48,376 for the MDMA-AT treatment course, including three preparation 90-minute sessions ($442 per session), three interventional sessions consisting of MDMA medication administration ($12,000 per session) and 8-hour psychotherapy ($2,357 per session), and nine 90-minute integration psychotherapy sessions ($442 per session). Using these cost estimates, the reported ICER was $83,845 per QALY. This was considered cost-effective as the WTP value in the model was $150,000 per QALY. The threshold was defined by the World Health Organization recommendation stating that the cost-effective boundary should be between one and three times the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita [16]. The World Bank data for 2022 reported $76,329.58 GDP per capita for the US [17], yielding a cost-effective threshold range between $76,330 and $228,989 per QALY, which corresponds to the MDMA medication cost of $11,056 to$30,242 per session. However, the authors used a median value (approximately $150,000) to have a fair comparison and considered it relevant for the modern US healthcare system. Regarding sensitivity analyses, univariate OWSA (10% parameter variation) identified utility changes due to MDMA-AT treatment as the most impactful parameter on study findings. The results were also consistent with 5,000 simulations in PSA. The ICER was lower than the WTP threshold in 72.12% of iterations. There are several published cost-effectiveness analyses including MDMA-AT for PTSD treatment. The most recent was published in 2022 by Marseille et al., including phase III clinical trial findings. Although the model had a different design than this study and was based on the Markov principles, it also demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-AT over the standard of care comparator with ICER of $47,554 per QALY at 1-year follow-up. In addition, standard of care was dominated by MDMA-AT at 10- and 30-year periods after receiving the intervention. The cost of full-course MDMA-AT treatment was $11,537 per patient [18]. However, the Marseille et al. model was based on multiple assumptions due to a lack of real-world economic and treatment patterns data. The authors used only MAPP1 clinical trial data as MAPP2 and MPLONG trials were not available at the time. Therefore, the Marseille et al. model was developed for patients with chronic severe PTSD, excluding those with moderate disease severity. Also, the long-term follow-up estimate may not be reliable since the phase III trial followed patients for only 4 months, and the model horizon covered a 30-year period after MDMA-AT administration. Another Marseille et al. economic model with an identical design used the findings of six phase 2 clinical trials in which MDMA-AT showed superiority to the standard of care arm among chronic, severe, treatment-resistant PTSD patients. MDMA-AT was cost-effective at 1-year endpoint (ICER $26,427 per QALY) and dominated standard of care at 10- and 30-year periods. The estimated price of two MDMA-AT (which included two interventional sessions) was $7,543 per patient. However, the model was based on small sample trials in patients with severe and treatment-resistant PTSD. Although the findings from a long-term assessment of phase II trials completers were incorporated in the model (mean follow-up 45.4 months), it included only 19 patients, which significantly limited the generalizability of results on 1,000 patients for the 30-year period [19]. Unlike the previous MDMA-AT health economic models, the inputs in this study were purely based on the real-world evidence and data of two phase III clinical trials, including a long-term observation of a larger sample of participants, to provide the best possible estimate. Despite the model covering 25-year period, primary findings presented benefits for a shorter time horizon (5 years), ensuring a higher level of reliability since the average length of follow-up in MPLONG from the parent trial baseline was 17 months. In addition, the long-term phase II clinical trial conducted by Mithoefer et al. demonstrated sustainable effects of MDMA-AT during an average of 3.8-year follow-up period, without significant changes in CAPS scores compared to baseline [20]. Mavranezouli et al. performed a network meta-analysis using available literature sources, supplemented by expert opinion, to populate a health economic model that compared 10 PTSD interventions with no treatment from the UK healthcare setting perspective [21]. The authors pointed out substantial between-study heterogeneity, mainly originating from the differences in PTSD patient characteristics and included interventions, which significantly affect the reliability of the findings. The results imply that Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) was the most cost-effective PTSD intervention, with a 1.8 QALY increment and £33,928 net monetary benefit (NMB) per patient. EMDR was followed by combined somatic/cognitive therapies (£33,364 NMB), self-help with support (£32,880 NMB), and psychoeducation (£32,754 NMB). The most cost-effective medication treatment compared to no treatment was the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with an NMB of £32,316 [21]. A systematic literature review by von der Warth et al. captured all economic evaluations of PTSD patients published until February 2020 regardless of the sample population, traumatic experience, or intervention type. The findings denoted that most published studies were low-to-moderate quality, lacked relevant reported information, and had inappropriate designs. Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) was the most assessed treatment with an ICER of $13,162 per QALY gained compared to usual treatment and $39,366 per additional PTSD remission compared to breathing retraining and psychoeducation comparator. Authors identified the need for accurate and comprehensive economic evaluations of PTSD interventions [22]. Hence, our study addresses this unmet need in the published literature by providing precise estimates of PTSD economic burden and extensive reporting of model findings. The health economic analyses of medications in PTSD are lacking in the published literature, with limited studies that evaluate cost-effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for PTSD. Mihalopoulos et al. [23] compared SSRIs and trauma-focused CBT to standard treatment practice for adults with PTSD in the Australian healthcare setting. The median ICER for trauma-focused CBT was $19,000 per QALY, with 100% uncertainty iterations falling beneath a $50,000 per QALY threshold. SSRIs showed a much lower ICER of only $200 per QALY, most likely due to a very low price, but the results were highly uncertain [23]. Another cost-effectiveness analysis by Le et al. [24] compared prolonged exposure psychotherapy to sertraline in a double-randomized treatment preference trial. Prolonged exposure psychotherapy was dominant to sertraline treatment with lower healthcare costs (-$262) and more QALY gained (0.056). The probability of cost-effectiveness with a $100,000 per QALY threshold was 93.2% [24]. Unlike other health economic models, this study provides highly precise estimates by utilizing real-world economic BOI and treatment patterns data of patients with PTSD instead of previously published literature. Analyzing individual patient data from clinical trials instead of using aggregated published results also increased the reliability of model findings. However, as with other health economic models, the study has several limitations that should be considered while interpreting the results. The main limitation refers to the BOI study and clinical trials used to populate the model inputs. Any limitations regarding inputs from these sources directly apply to this economic evaluation as well. The second limitation is the generalizability of model findings. Although the model used data from two clinical trials and a long-term follow up study, the total number of patients may not be sufficient to fully reflect the real-world sample. Also, heterogeneity in population characteristics (i.e., comorbidities, disease severity, demographics) may limit the generalizability. Third, the choice of the model comparator was limited due to a lack of evidence on direct comparisons and specific study protocols. Hence, the comparator arm was the placebo with therapy from MDMA-AT clinical trials instead of treatments from PTSD clinical practice. Fourth, the average observation of patients in the follow-up study was 17 months, while the model time horizon was 25 years. This study demonstrated that MDMA-AT was a more cost-effective treatment than placebo with therapy for patients with chronic moderate or higher severity PTSD. Inputs with the highest impact on model findings were quality of life benefits in treatment and comparator arms. The results were consistent with 5,000 simulations. Based on these findings, MDMA-AT is a novel option for patients with chronic PTSD that may decrease disease burden, including economic aspects, and improve patient outcomes after a single treatment course. All steps in conducting the research were supervised and critically reviewed by experts from Lykos Therapeutics.

Title: Streaming Video Prices Rise While Quality Falls, Following Cable TV’s Lead
URL: https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/12/streaming-video-prices-rise-while-quality-falls-following-cable-tvs-lead/

Culture Streaming video still provides some meaningful advantages to traditional cable: it’s generally cheaper (assuming you don’t sign up for every service under the sun); customer satisfaction ratings are generally higher; and users have more power to pick and choose and cancel services at a whim. But the party simply isn’t poised to last. Thanks to industry consolidation and saturated market growth, streaming giants have started behaving much like the traditional cable giants they once disrupted. As with most industries suffering from “enshittification,” that generally means steadily worse service at higher prices to appease Wall Street’s demand for improved quarterly returns at any cost (even long term company health). As a result, Netflix has started acting like password sharing, something it advocated for for years, is a dire cardinal sin. Amazon now thinks would be fun to increase the number of ads it runs, charging Amazon Prime users even more money to avoid them. Consumers are paying more for streaming than ever as layoffs abound, streaming catalogs shrink, and the underlying product quality gets worse. Ars Technica points to a recent flood of surveys from TiVO, CableTV.com, and Whip Media that all show that streaming customers continue to report a drop in the quality and customer satisfaction of streaming services over the last few years. When asked why this is happening, TiVo analysts suggest the problem is simply that companies are struggling to make streaming profitable: “The amount of new original content overall on SVODs may be down [year over year] as many streamers continue to struggle to hit profitability targets. Without new original content (or exclusive content deals), perceptions of value/differentiation may decline.” You’ll notice that neither the trend-studying organizations nor Ars discuss several important things. One, the pay for fail-upward media sector executives (like Time Warner CEO David Zaslav) continues to skyrocket despite both strategic missteps and quality problems. Two, that mindless consolidation and a “growth for growth’s sake” merger mania mindset is only accelerating all these problems. Or three, that this is all driven by Wall Street’s insatiable need for improved short-term quarterly improvements at any cost, regardless if that ultimately harms consumers, workers, or the product itself. It’s simply not good enough to provide an affordable product people really like; the need for improved quarterly returns at impossible, permanent scale inevitably results in a sort of product cannibalization and destructive performance art (see: the AT&T Time Warner Discovery mergers) that’s not really subtle. Companies can mitigate this erosion if they’re in sectors where there’s still subscriber growth to be had or if they’re able to expand into additional business opportunities. But streaming subscriber growth has hit a wall, and there’s nowhere else to really go if your product is quality film and television. So instead we get more creative ways to be annoying and nickel-and-dime customers for ever-sagging product quality. This results in an enshittification cycle that absolutely will drive more users to either free services (Twitch, TikTok, YouTube) or piracy, at which point streaming executives will blame everything (younger generations! VPNs!) but their own choices. It’s exactly what cable TV executives did. And many of those folks now work in streaming, having been financially incentivized every step of the way to have learned nothing from the experience. Filed Under: competition, consumers, enshittification, prices, streaming, tv, video Companies: disney, netflix, warner bros. discovery YouTube also get big price raises for their premium plans (like their Premium Family just recently). There has been a lot of investments in streaming services and still not much has been collected, and since the user engagement is, at best, stalling, the only solution is to continue to milk the poor skinny cash cows that are subscribers. And since producing good content will always cost more and more (new technology allow reducing some production cost, but not marketing), and that nobody is eager to invest no more, video streaming is doom to become like music streaming: not a revolution but another way to get content. So yes, I’m still buying my CDs like a 80s dinosaur, and yes, I am paying more and more to listen to them. Calling an early shot that at least one Democratic Primary contender in 2028 will put streaming costs and ad runs in their stump speech, correctly (if belatedly) throwing blame on the Trump irregulation policy. (This makes one massive assumption, but we’re all entitled to a bit of optimism to start our weeks) The same party that as soon as it took office after correctly calling The Patriot Act a direct assault on the 4th Amendment decided it was a great idea and didn’t go far enough? https://newrepublic.com/article/155793/hell-democrats-just-extend-patriot-act The same party that first called the idea of building more walls on the southern border stupid, but then built more? https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/biden-administration-waives-federal-laws-allow-border-wall-constructio-rcna118959 That party? You really have learned absolutely nothing from the shellacking the outspoken fascists just gave you. “The Democrats will make things somewhat better, but they’ll still be bad, so let’s make things worse!” Fuck me. The American left is dumber than dog shit. yup, people are dumb – film at eleven. Thing is, most people are neither right nor left. If you were smart you would know this. What is Right and what is Left? Define them in your glorious detail. Now try to fit the entire population into your two little cubby holes. Square peg, round hole, better get a bigger hammer for this one. After November 5th, I’m somewhat more inclined to agree. That the American left wasted a brat-branded opportunity, boycotted the vote over the Israeli-Gaza war, and twice handed the White House over to a power-mad, vindictive, rambling waste of space isn’t just ridiculous, it’s embarrassing. boycotted the vote over the Israeli-Gaza war for what its worth there is zero evidence that israel/gaza/genocide played any roll here. just because some people made it their main cause doesn’t mean that american voters did. November 5th is also the date that British people burn effigies on bonfires, for what it’s worth. Regarding the border wall issue…. “Congress appropriated fiscal year 2019 funds for the construction of border barrier in the Rio Grande Valley, and DHS is required to use those funds for their appropriated purpose,” the CBP spokesperson said… So, what was it you proposed that Biden do about money congress allocated during Trump’s term? They don’t dislike the idea of a king. They just want a different type of king. The Emperor has no clothes. Did you have to, dude? I’m never going to get that image of Trump naked out of my head now. They’re going to have to. I’m starting to think the next Democrat should run on eliminating taxes on eggs and literally nothing else. 45 million American adults are functionally illiterate. Tell them you will put a tariff on avocado toast. Ups sales of bread and avocadoes so people can make it themselves at home. Net loss to diners. I don’t mind the inflation as much as I minded my cable fees promoting Fox News Reading this latest TD piece made me think about Walter Kirn on Oprah’s $1 million fee for the Kamala interview: ‘You would have thought Oprah would have gotten to the point in her life where she would have stopped Hitler for free, being a billionaire and everything.’ Matt Taibbi: ‘[Laughing] It is funny that you need to charge to stop Hitler.’ xD How is it, the way you become a billionaire? Does it require certain traits? Perhaps an unwillingness to throw money at causes (unless there’s a tax break somewhere, in which case you’re effectively throwing the government’s money)? I would think that stopping literal Nazism was worth any cost to the individual or society! “on Oprah’s $1 million fee” You mean the thing that did not happen, but was being spread by a bunch of idiot right wingers? https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/oprah-winfrey-rumors-kamala-harris-campaign-one-million-1236060133/ It was paid to Marx or whatever oprahs production company is called Harpo Productions There’s a further link to inadequate antitrust enforcement here: A quality product that is not taking advantage of opportunities to increase its quarterly profit is an attractive acquisition target i.e., Either you are the predator, or you are the prey. the need for improved quarterly returns at impossible, permanent scale inevitably results in a sort of product cannibalization and destructive performance art (see: the AT&T Time Warner Discovery mergers) that’s not really subtle.

November 12, 2024 8:00am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Peter Goodman, How the World ran Out of Everything, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio. Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, another extra special guest, Peter Goodman, is the award-winning investigative reporter and economics correspondent for the New York Times, his latest book, how the World Ran Out Of Everything Inside The Global Supply Chain. What a fascinating deep dive into how we got here in terms of why were we unable to get basic protective equipment during the pandemic? How could we not get ventilators or even things like face masks and, and gowns. What led us to outsourcing everything and not having a backup, not having an emergency system. How did we break our resilience leading up to the pandemic? I thought the book was a great read and very fascinating. I learned a lot about it, and I, I think this conversation is fascinating also, if you’re at all interested in things like global supply chains, the role of consultants in, and the role of shareholder primacy in how society operates, plus all the craziness that took place during the pandemic is detailed in the book and in with great specificity, I think you’ll find this conversation fascinating. With no further ado, my discussion with the New York Times, Peter Goodman. Peter Goodman: Thanks so much, Barry. Great to be here. Barry Ritholtz: So I found the book fascinating. It’s such a fresh story in everybody’s minds. But before we get into the book, let’s talk a little bit about your background. You, you have really a fascinating career. Oh, thanks. You, you start as a feature writer freelancing in Japan from Southeast Manila and Jakarta. How on earth did that happen? Peter Goodman: Yeah, so, you know, I was one of those kids who got outta college and just, I did what I wanted to do. I, I liked to write, I had been sort of a political activist in college, but life seemed more complicated than it did to my activist friends. So journalism drew me and I wanted to go check out Southeast Asia. So I, I first stopped in Japan, got a job writing features for the Japan Times, teaching English to pay the bills and save up the money to then move to Manila, and then eventually Jakarta spent a lot of time in Cambodia. Wow. Covered a massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in East Timor, got kicked outta Indonesia, came back to the States and ended up in Alaska at the Anchorage Daily News. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, I was gonna ask, how, how do you find your way from, from Asia to, to Anchorage? What, what was it like reporting from a small town in Alaska? Peter Goodman: Yeah, I mean, I basically figured out that if I wanted to do this seriously, I was gonna have to go somewhere to, to learn journalism. I didn’t go to J school, went to a liberal arts college where we didn’t have, you know, that sort of paper where we had beats and, and structure. And I, I understood that, you know, freelancing would take me a certain distance, but if I wanted to be serious about it, I had to go work, you know, doing local journalism somewhere. And the anchor, I, I was lucky enough to be hired by the Anchorage Daily News, which was just a heavyweight shop of talent, only about, you know, 16, maybe 20 reporters. They had won the Gold Medal for Public Service Pulitzer, huh? A few years before I got there. They were a finalist the year before I got there for the Exxon Valdez crash. And it was just a very talented, creative group of people. I, and yes, I ended up in, I was living in Palmer, which is next to Wasilla. It was the local government reporter where I covered, as you can probably guess, a then unknown member of the Wasilla City Council named Sarah Palin. 00:03:45 [Speaker Changed] And how and how did that turn out? Peter Goodman: You know, it was, it was fascinating. I mean, there’s nothing like having a local beat and having to figure out who matters. What’s a story? How do I go to a, a meeting of local government, prepare for whatever issue seems most interesting, develop sources, build people’s trust, figure out, you know, when you get it wrong, how to make it right. And, and, you know, there’s nothing like being in a place where someone will call you if you get a fact wrong. I mean, when you’re freelancing in Cambodia, writing about Cambodian refugees, you spell somebody’s name wrong, nobody’s gonna call you. You mess up a fact. Like I once messed up a fact. You know, I, I misheard somebody, say assessment when they meant Cessna. And boy, I, I thought I was gonna have to flee the state in embarrassment you, and you learn how to, how to get it right. Barry Ritholtz: So you have a knack for being in the right place at the right time. You were the Shanghai Bureau chief for the Washington Post, really, as China was emerging as a global superpower. Tell, tell us a little bit about your experiences in Shanghai. Peter Goodman: Yeah, that was as just an incredible story. It was a story of a lifetime. I mean, it was, it was a moment where China had become a, a very significant story in the American media and, and imagination and, and politics. But, but it was still before, you know, everybody had these giant bureaus before we were covering news in this very granular way. So you had time to really dig into stuff. And, you know, we had two guys in Beijing who were phenomenal, my two colleagues who did a lot of political stuff. And I was ostensibly the economic writer. But the truth was, all of her stories were more or less the same because everything was an economic and political story combined. Right. And it was a moment where you could just sort of point at anything like, how did that ballpoint bearing factory get there? Who owns it? How did the land and the energy become available? Where are they selling their product? Who’s getting a cut of the action? You know, anything you dug into was a story that would tell you something about power and the trajectory of, of the Chinese economy. Barry Ritholtz: And, and I’m sure that helped set the stage for all the things you saw when the world ran out of everything. But, we’ll, we’ll circle back to that. You also covered the financial crisis and recession as the Times New York based economic correspondent. Right. I have a vivid recollection of my experience during the financial crisis. Tell us a little bit about your experience in ’08, ’09. Peter Goodman: Well, you know, it’s interesting. I I, I was sort of an accidental national economic correspondent. ’cause I was very happily working for the Washington Post covering international econ. And the post was, let us say, not having its best days. Right. And I had this opportunity to go to the Times, and they offered me the National Economic Correspondent. I thought, well, you know, I’m living in New York at the time. I’m working in the New York Bureau of the Washington Post. Wasn’t all that keen to leave. I love the Washington Post, but I thought, well, I better do this sleepy story, the national economy. It’s the fall of 2007. Didn’t know anything about it, was surrounded by people who knew much more about it than, than I ever would. The first story I ever pitched was, you know, it seems like consumer spending is drying up because housing prices are falling. That could be significant. I keep reading that, you know, consumer spending is more than two thirds of, of the American economy. So I got Mark Zandy to go crunch some data for me, showing where were home equity lines of credit drying up the fastest, and what was their historical relationship to consumer spending. And I got this crunched for like every metropolitan area in the United States. And, and almost at random, I said, I’m gonna go out to Reno. Barry Ritholtz: I was gonna say four areas stick out in my mind. Southern Florida. Yeah, Vegas and, and Reno, right. As two and three. Yeah. Southern California. Right. And I’m trying to remember, maybe DC was the other area that was, Peter Goodman: Well, there were a lot. Yes. DC was hit for sure. There were parts of New England that were hit. Right. But you just listed that. But so I, I sort of randomly said, well, I’m going out to Reno because if you look at the ratio of home equity lines of credit to consumer spending, we’ve seen this big right dry up fest. And within five minutes of getting off the planet, I had no real reporting plan. I pulled off the road from the airport headed to where I was staying, and there was a tile shop. And I went in, introduced myself and talked to this guy, Marshall Witty, who was a salesman who at that time was about to send the keys back on his third spec house. His commissions were drying up. He told me how he had, you know, financed a trip to Tahiti for his honeymoon on home equity line and credit. He used to get a new truck every year for the variety of color. And suddenly he’s answering his phone. No, dude, I can’t go to the club tonight. I’m staying home to watch Netflix. And I just sort of glued myself to this guy for three days. I met all of his friends and I went back to New York, and I remember saying to my colleagues in the newsroom, we are, and I used an impolite word that I will not use on your radio program. We are, you know, really up a creek here. And they’ll say, you know, calm down. You know, let’s take it easy. But that story, I, I sort of just accidentally fell my way into, I I, I saw that this was gonna be really bad. It was not merely a mild recession. And so every story I did afterwards, I mean, as I then got into the minutia of how the mortgage markets work and eventually covered the foreclosure crisis really began with that just basic, you know, naive, you know, question, well, what’s gonna happen when we can’t just use our homes as, as ATM machines anymore? That seems like it’ll have implications. And yes, it did. Barry Ritholtz: That reminds me a little bit of the scene from the Big Short, either the book or the movie, but in, in the movie, it’s Steve Carrell speaking to a stripper about the home she bought to fix up. Right, right. And he said, he goes, wait, you, you’re buying this home as an investment property. And she’s like, I have six homes as an investment property. And suddenly he realizes, oh, we are in for a world of trouble. This is much worse than anyone imagined it. 00:09:46 [Speaker Changed] It’s exactly that. In fact, the guys I was hanging out with when I said, well, I’ll take you out to to dinner and drink so we can have a longer conversation, we ended up in a place where there were people of, of that profession. It was actually my first expenses that I ever recruited as a New York Times writer. And I was embarrassed to submit them given tickets [Because it was so expensive?]. It wasn’t that it was so expensive. It was what it was the name of the place!. Barry Ritholtz: I love the expression, the expression jingle mail people used to put their keys in an envelope and send it back to the bank. And that’s jingle mail. I’m done with this. Peter Goodman: Actually, Marshall Woody explained that to me. I didn’t even understand what he meant. He said, yeah, I’m sending the keys back. I’m like, whatcha talking about doing what? He’s like, well, you know, this home, I never expected to live here. I guess I’m gonna be spending some time here. I figured I’d be moving uptown, you know, next year. That’s not happening. Barry Ritholtz: It, it’s amazing. And, and in fact, until the financial crisis, I don’t think anybody ever stopped to find out, am I in a recourse state or a non-recourse state? Meaning am I still on the hook after I lose the house? Or is the bank limited to just, they get the house and I get to walk away? Peter Goodman: I mean, let’s face it, we all click agree, read all the terms to millions of documents a day that we don’t even read a sentence of. Right. Right. And suddenly we’re living in the fine print. Oh, they’re actually are terms that are gonna apply here. That matter. Right. That matter. That people that we deluded ourselves into believing would never, you know, this never mattered because housing prices are going up forever. Even Alan Greenspan says that you’re a sucker if you don’t get a variable rate mortgage. And you know what could happen? Oh, if it doesn’t work out, I’ll refi, I’ll sell. So well suddenly, you know, we’re dealing with the all of this ink that was never intended to have effect. 00:11:27 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. I, I’m still to this day, amazed that the models never allowed for home prices to fall in New York. I have a vivid recollection of finishing grad school in 89, and anybody I know who bought a co-op or condo in New York, they were underwater for 5, 6, 7 years until, until the next leg, late, late nineties. And the booming stock market started to send real estate prices higher. But you don’t have to go that far back in time. Look at the 1970s to see when inflation made, at least in real term, home prices not go up. And then, you know, pre-war, there were some pretty bad recessions in depressions in the turn of the century or the twenties and thirties. Obviously, homes weren’t as widespread owned back then as they are now. And I don’t wanna spend too much time talking about the financial crisis. I have to ask you, you’ve done multiple trips to some pretty heavy conflict zones, Iraq, Cambodia, Sudan, East Timor. What’s it like being in these areas? Are you embedded with the US military or are you just walking around hoping no one takes a pot shot at you? Peter Goodman: It depends. I have been embedded in places, you know, Iraq actually, I was there at the best possible time to be a journalist, you know, in this period. Like the, I was there as Bush declared mission accomplished. I was just in my own SUV driving from the Kuwait airport up to Basra with a couple Washington Post colleagues. And then we drove, you know, all the way up to Baghdad and Keokuk. And actually, I’ll never forget the car broke down when we put a black market gasoline. And at some point I had to call him National Car Rental in Kuwait, and then get that thing on the back of a flatbed truck through all these laid off truck drivers who had no business. And we hired somebody for a couple hundred bucks to drive it through the desert. You know, it’s, it, it’s always, I I’m not a thrill seeker by nature. I mean, there are, there are people who cover conflict who’ve spent a lot more time in conflict zones than, than I ever will. Some of whom, you know, I fear for their safety, right? ’cause there is, I, I’m just somebody who wants to see what’s going on. I’m not like the bravest soul, but, but there’s nothing like being in a place. And boy, I mean, Iraq after Saddam was just a goldmine for journalists because there are all these people, many of whom are English speaking, who are, are dying to tell their stories. Whether it’s like, how do these trading companies work despite American sanctions? I did a story on smuggling out of the Port of Basra, where like in a day I found the guy who like ran a smuggling ring, who took me to the porch, showed me the fake bills of lading. Like, that was absolutely incredible. Huh. Cambodia was, was an endlessly Barry Ritholtz: Fascinating place. Of all these, of all these wild overseas stories you’ve done, what’s been your favorite to cover? What’s been the most challenging? Peter Goodman: That’s a, that’s a tough question. I, I mean, I would say that Iraq coverage just felt so vivid and, and important. And I mean, there, there’s nothing like when, when you get accustomed to doing, you know, sort of enterprise or investigative or longer form stuff, there’s nothing like being in a place where it’s like, no, people actually want to know right now what happened to you today. And, and stories almost write themselves. I’m gonna go to, you know, an oil refinery that shut down ’cause the looters came and the Halliburton people haven’t figured out how to turn it back on. And there are a bunch of Iraqi employees saying, who’s gonna pay us? And how come we can’t go in there? You know, these sorts of stories are just so vivid and, and compelling. So I, I found that, you know, particularly amazing. I mean, my, my time in China was kind of un unbeatable as, as well. It’s just such a fascinating place. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah. Really fascinating. Let’s talk a little bit about some of the background philosophy. Tell us about the Lean Taliban and the cult of efficiency. 00:15:18 [Speaker Changed] Love it. Yeah. So the Lean Taliban refers to the way the people at McKinsey and Company, the business consultancy viewed themselves in proselytizing for lean manufacturing, or just in time as we know it now, just in time, is a very sensible idea, pioneered by Toyota that says, you know, instead of having giant warehouses filled with all kinds of stuff that we may need at some point in the future, but who knows when it’s Japan, the end of the second World War space is limited, capital’s limited. Let’s have the suppliers bring the stuff we need on the supply chain as we need it. They, they sort of emulated the way a supermarket deals with milk. You, you want enough on the shelf that everybody gets milk, they don’t leave unhappy, they can’t buy it, but not so much that you’re spilling it. Well, this is a great idea until business consultancies like McKinsey get hold of it and turn it into this crude imperative to just slash inventory hand the extra savings to the corporate executives as a reward for being smart enough to hire McKinsey. 00:16:20 And I end up digging deep into how this actually works in the decades before the pandemic, and I spent time with this guy in Minnesota who was working at this industrial generator plant where McKinsey’s, lean Taliban show up, bunch of slick suited young people, straight outta Ivy League universities, one older guy from the Chicago branch. And they say, you’re doing it all wrong. You know, why do you have all these $5 sheet metal brackets sitting around taking up space in warehouses? Let’s go lean, just order them when you need them. And the guy I’m talking to, he says, well, well hold on Indus, these are giant industrial generators that need to be installed by Crane. Talk about just in time. And if we listen to your advice, we’re gonna be slow with orders. Which is exactly what happens. So now they’re spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to expedite delivery of their products. They’re losing sales because they’re upsetting the contractors. We’re waiting for their generators. Also, they can say, look at us being so lean that we don’t have $5 sheet metal brackets. 00:17:24 [Speaker Changed] And, and, and without those brackets, you can’t complete that generator. Correct. But even worse, when you give people incentives and metrics, no matter how ridiculous they may be, they follow those incentives and they, they’ll do those metrics to the point where the people running the factory will not take delivery of key components. Right. ’cause it’ll be sitting on their books on the 29th of the month and it’ll screw up their metrics. Exactly. They leave ’em the, they won’t accept parking lot until first, until the first 00:17:56 [Speaker Changed] Right out in the parking lot. 00:17:57 [Speaker Changed] And it, that just seems like, no, aren’t we supposed to be making products and selling them this secondary level of metrics seems kind of absurd. This 00:18:05 [Speaker Changed] Is central to understanding the product shortages that we’ve experienced for the last few years in overdoing it on lean. And the ultimate example, the story I tell in the book is I found a railroad engineer out in Idaho who’s working for Union Pacific now. The railroads have their own version of the Lean Taliban. It’s called precision scheduled railroading, fancy way of saying, let’s lay off lots of workers. Let’s stick the remaining workers with more jobs. Let’s make scheduling really complicated. Let’s, let’s limit scheduled service, make trains longer than ever. Well, so this railroad engineer is horrified to discover that he’s actually pulling freight to the wrong destinations. And this is not by accident, this is because Union Pacific has told Wall Street, we hear you on the need for efficiency and going lean. We’re gonna limit dwell time, which is the amount of time that cargo sits in any individual place. 00:19:00 And so the guy running Union Pacific’s rail yard in Nebraska absorbs this mantra and says, well, I don’t care where the next train’s going. I am attaching as many cars to it as possible. So I have done my job. I have lowered dwell time. Well, the real effect of this is there’s somebody sitting in Southern California waiting for auto parts that are in Oregon. ’cause this guy’s hauling them to the wrong place. We’ve lowered dwell time. Wall Street’s happy. If all you’re looking at is some window on a Excel spreadsheet, oh, the railroad is more efficient than ever. If you’re the paint manufacturer in California needing a drum of chemicals that’s stuck in Washington state, and now you gotta tell your customers you’re late with the order, that doesn’t seem particularly efficient. My takeaway from doing this book is there’s a lot of inefficiency in this ruthless efficiency. 00:19:50 [Speaker Changed] So I wanna, I’m glad you brought that up because I am not a big fan of consultants in general. You have a lot of interesting things to say about McKinsey in the book who, who perhaps have not distinguished themselves over the years with many of the things they’ve contributed to it. It’s sort of funny to see a bunch of Ivy League suits who’ve never run a factory or who’ve never run a railroad or who’ve never run a, a retail shop, come in and say, no, no, you’re doing this all wrong. Here are the metrics that will get you a higher stock price on Wall Street, regardless of the subsequent impact to either your sales, your profits, your other stakeholders, including employees and customers. Right. Just a relentless pursuit of how can we get the stock price up regardless, right. Is that, is that a fair assessment? Yeah, 00:20:44 [Speaker Changed] I think that is a fair assessment. And the problem is that that trick works time and again 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] For a while anyway. 00:20:50 [Speaker Changed] Y you know, I I mean, you think about slashing inventory, right? Which on the books, if all you’re thinking about is you’re in a cubicle and you’re analyzing numbers for some publicly traded company, you slash inventory, you’ve lowered, or I’m sorry, you’ve increased return on asset because inventory is asset, right? So asset is now smaller. Whatever your revenue is, is divided by a smaller number. That’s a higher measurement. Well, as a, as this London Business School professor I talked to for the book, put it to me. Yeah, that’s really great. But if you can’t make a ventilator in the middle of a pandemic because you’ve managed your inventory, so that quarter to quarter you’ve boosted your return on asset, you don’t get to say, well, at least our share price is high. 00:21:32 [Speaker Changed] So I remember having a conversation with Duff McDonald who wrote a book called The Firm Oh yeah. About McKinsey and Company. And, and some of the things that McKinsey is responsible for is, is kind of like shocking. Like it, it seems whenever there’s some financial engineering based disaster, and you look into the details somewhere in the back of it is some consulting person right. From McKinsey who says, what would happen if instead of doing it the way you always did it, we focused on these metrics instead. Right. And let’s see if that helps get the stock price up. It sounds like lean inventory and just in time delivery is a version of focusing on a secondary characteristic in order to affect the stock price rather than focusing on increasing revenues and doing it more efficiently. 00:22:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean, let me be clear, just in time is a good idea and trying to eliminate waste from your supply chain is a good idea. The question is, are you doing it in a way that’s commonsensical or in a way that’s purely driven by trying to hit some metric that some 22-year-old at a Harvard told you, you know, is a good way to 00:22:47 [Speaker Changed] Do it. So, so let’s stay with that, because you talk about Toyota’s role in all of this, right? Toyota, they’re on an island, the everything is destroyed post World War ii, it would make, and they don’t have a lot of capital. So given those constraints, their version of common sense, rational, lean inventory, you know, given their constraints seems to be pretty 00:23:11 [Speaker Changed] Intelligent. Oh, it was, it was highly 00:23:12 [Speaker Changed] Effective and, and it worked. Is the implication that when everybody else started implementing this via consultants, they just took it way too far, is that the thinking? 00:23:24 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s that the consultants understand who they’re working for, they are working for executives who must get the share price to go up right now. And if they fail to do that, they’re gonna be looking for their next job. So whether they think it’s commonsensical or not, in terms of the long run, I mean, look, this, we learned up close during the financial crisis, right? Right. Like you can now 00:23:44 [Speaker Changed] Radical deregulation turned out to have a cost to it. 00:23:47 [Speaker Changed] I mean, you can have spectacular business failures that we can all see that are wildly successful for all the people involved as long as they get out before the plane crashes. Part of the mixed metaphor. And, and so if, if you talk about the role of, of consultants, it’s a question of are you distilling it down to this kind of cultish reverence for just hitting that one metric? I mean, even Toyota, well first of all, Toyota understood that they needed their suppliers close at hand because you have to be able to replenish the supply. If something goes wrong, they would never have signed up for supply chains across oceans, which is what we get from McKinsey combined with the rise of the, of container shipping and the internet and all these, all of these things that have made our version of globalization, you know, doable. 00:24:34 What’s happened is we’ve eliminated all the margin for trouble. But McKinsey actually, even McKinsey, realized that we had gone too far in the nineties when they discovered that Toyota factories were telling their suppliers not to replenish enough to fill even the existing space on the assembly line. They said, well, this doesn’t make any sense. Even McKinsey said, look, why have two trips to replenish the same workspace, just so you can say on the spreadsheet that, you know, you’re only holding four bits as opposed to eight. That’s right. Even, even McKinsey recognized that was bananas. But 00:25:09 [Speaker Changed] That’s you coming down the other side of the efficiency curve and all along this stuff, you’re giving up long term resiliency in favor of these short-term metrics of supposed efficiency. Fair, fair statement. Yeah, 00:25:22 [Speaker Changed] I think that’s right. Look, you know, take this to, to real life. Imagine that you told your kid who you’re trying to get to brush teeth. At the end of the day, I insist that you spend five minutes by the sink. You know? Well, if that’s how you do it, your kid’s gonna spend five minutes by the sink watching YouTube videos. You know, common sense is no, I better get involved in knowing what exactly are they doing and what, like, how’s this gonna play out? Well, we’ve effectively let McKinsey write those kinds of rules. And it’s not just McKinsey, it’s lots of business consultancies. And it’s not even just because of the business consultancies. It’s, it’s that we’ve handed over our business and societal fate to shareholder interests, to the exclusion of anything resembling common sense. 00:26:02 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. None of this is a new concern. I was fascinated in the book in Henry Ford was concerned about supply chains and resource availability a century ago when he was building the Model T, how did his concerns about supply chains be so easily forgotten? 00:26:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so Henry Ford, I I, I was fascinated by this story myself, you know, bonded with Thomas Alva Edison riding a rail car back from a trade show at a hotel on Coney Island. This is, you know, in the 19 teens, Edison is his hero and they bond over the supply chain. Edison says, yeah, you know, you have all these great creations, but if you can’t get the materials you need, these are, these are just ideas. And Ford was obsessed with self-sufficiency. I mean, to the extent to which he had his own fiascos, you know, trying to become self-sufficient rubber. He had this failed venture in Brazil, but you know, the scale of his factories, like including the River Rouge factory, which remains, you know, Ford’s showcase outside of Detroit was all about having soup to nuts. The ability to make a car without, as Ford put it being pinched by some supplier. 00:27:15 He was suspicious of rail in particular. So he bought his own rail and shipping lines. Vertical integration didn’t exactly work out, but that concept of let’s understand what we’re dependent on and how reliable is the supply. I mean, Ford would’ve been horrified to see what I saw at his River Rouge plant, a century later where I’m, I’m actually watching the F-150 come off the line. This is Ford’s most popular vehicle pickup truck. Beautiful vehicle, amazing, you know, orchestrated assembly with some automation. But at the time that I’m watching this in January, 2022, they’re taking the cars and parking them in these giant lots in the shadow of Ford’s corporate headquarters and across the street from Henry Ford Elementary School because they’re dependent upon one supplier for the computer chips happens to be across the ocean on this island that not incidentally is claimed by China as part of its own territory. I’m talking about Taiwan. And until these computer chips show up, these F1 fifties are just taking up space in a parking lot. 00:28:17 [Speaker Changed] Four horrified. I had, I had a car come off lease, I wanna say late 21 or early 22. And I recall going to the dealer and going through a whole floor of cars, and they were divided in half. That half doesn’t have the chip for the sunroof, which we’re allowed to sell. Right. So the sunroof is closed and whenever the chip comes, o back comes in, bring the car back and we’ll get you sunroof working. Right. Those cars, they don’t have the a, BS chip, we’re not allowed to sell those. You can’t drive. So you can’t, you could drive it, but a, b, s, but stop it. That would be flood. Well, you could stop it the way you stopped cars 20 years ago without all the technology. And so, wait, I don’t understand why, why can’t you get these chips? And that, that was an early read into that. So we, we talked about Toyota and Ford and McKinsey. If we’re talking about supply chain and globalization, we have to also talk about the outsourcing to China, right? Where you spent a lot of time. Right. And I’m curious about the role of Walmart. Yeah. In moving so much manufacturing capacity to China. Tell us a little bit about Walmart. 00:29:27 [Speaker Changed] So Walmart is the ultimate example of how publicly traded companies have undercut costs in the name of gratifying consumers with low prices. And they found in China the, you know, ultimate solution to their bottom line concerns. I mean, here’s this country where there’s no labor unions. They’re, they’re effectively, they’re banned by the Communist Party. You can cut a deal with the Communist Party official to get hold of space or resources. You’re tapping into the world’s potentially largest consumer market for, you know, just about everything. And China, even before China enters the World Trade Organization in 2001, but especially afterwards, I is the, you know, perfect place to make products at scale, increasing sophistication, low cost. And, you know, we spend a lot of time now talking about how this supposed, you know, export juggernaut intent on killing American living standards is undercut all these manufacturing jobs in the us. I mean, it isn’t, I’m glad you’re, you’re, you’re putting the focus on companies like Walmart because it really was American and western companies in general clamoring for a shot at the Chinese market as a way to satisfy their own concerns for low prices to make their share prices go up. 00:30:50 [Speaker Changed] Huh. So what about the politicians? Who, who do we blame? Is this Bill Clinton? Is this Ronald Reagan who helped set the stage for the hollowing out of the American Industrial Center and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization? 00:31:06 [Speaker Changed] Well, I’m not so sure that it was wrong, by the way, to let China enter the World Trade Organization, though we could have put more focus on terms for, for labor and human rights and, and, and 00:31:18 [Speaker Changed] Environmental 00:31:19 [Speaker Changed] And environment for for sure. You know, I I I argue in the book that, you know, most of our problems and the problems are significant in terms of the, so-called China Shock that cost, you know, a million direct manufacturing jobs in the decade or so after China. China enters the wt O and 2 million, if you count, you know, the truck drivers who right. No longer have a factory to deliver to, you know, that’s really home cooking, right? I mean, other countries, I mean, Canada is not, you know, seething with anti-trade sentiment to the extent that it is in the US because they have national healthcare there. We Right, we don’t have national healthcare. We don’t, we have trade adjustment assistance, but it’s woefully underfunded. That’s a program that’s supposed to help people who lose their jobs because of trade deals transition to something else. I mean, it’s our own political decisions that have left workers effectively abandoned when, when, when they lose their jobs. 00:32:07 And in terms of the net trade with China has actually been a positive for the American economy. It’s a question of how we’ve distributed the spoils. But in terms of how that all came about, yeah, I think you gotta look at Clinton, who, I mean, I tell the story in the book of how Clinton runs in 92 as the answer to George HW Bush calls him, calls him out for supposedly coddling the butchers of Beijing, you know, cozying up to the Chinese Communist Party after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Clinton vows, that things are gonna be different in his own administration. Human rights are gonna matter so much. And not even a decade later, he’s at the Great Hall of the people. This is across the street from Kenman Square itself, saluting his host. This is Jang Zain with Hillary by his side and, and saluting the great strides that China has made as he’s lobbying for this deal that will bring China in into the WTO. And he even goes to the back of the hall, picks up the baton and conducts the People’s Liberation Army Orchestra. This is the orchestra for the institution responsible for the Tiananmen massacre. Now why does he do this? Because he comes from Arkansas. This is Walmart’s home state because the Democratic party and the Republican party for that matter, awash in campaign contributions from retailers, manufacturers who want a crack at China. ’cause it’s good for business. And, and that ultimately drives the equation 00:33:35 [Speaker Changed] During that debate about China entering to the WTO, we heard the phrase democracy tossed around a lot, right? That this will open up China to democracy, that this will improve their environmental regulations, it’ll improve human rights and their labor laws. None of that happens. 00:33:55 [Speaker Changed] None of this happens. We hear this from Larry Summers, we hear this from Bill Clinton. We hear this from Bob Rubin. What does happen? Bob Rubin gets to go to China with Citigroup and make Right, you know, 00:34:06 [Speaker Changed] As chairman, 00:34:07 [Speaker Changed] As chairman, you know, and, and crack that market. And that’s good for, for their share price. Of course, what happens, China does become the workshop to the world. Retailers get a crack at this giant market for a time. Although we’ve never really gotten the market opening. That’s right. Promises that we got share, prices do go up because costs come down. Consumers, you know, if, if, if you like the idea of being able to go to Walmart and buy a badminton set for three bucks or whatever, like you, you got the bonanza. But we got a lot of lost manufacturing jobs. We got a real hit to the kind of psyche of American industrial areas. Our politics change, not, not for the better. As inequality sinks in and is working, people understand that their ability to support their families doesn’t seem to matter very much to the people running the economy. 00:34:55 [Speaker Changed] In, in the beginning, it, it felt like there were inexpensive products from China later on. That lack of environmental regulations or lack of even basic safety standards kind of cause problems. I don’t know about you, I won’t buy dog treats or food made in China. ’cause you never know what’s in them. We had that whole thing with the sheet rock that was mildew or problematic. Yeah. And, and on and on Every time it, it seems that there’s a problem with a Chinese product. It’s not that the, the people who are working in the factories are doing anything wrong, it’s that they’re just allowed to do anything with no sort of regulatory oversight. So you end up with asbestos in sheet rock, or you end up with some bad chemical in the dog bones. At, at what point is, is the backlash from the lack of regulatory oversight in China gonna actually impact them? 00:35:56 [Speaker Changed] Well, I mean, it has had some effect, right? I mean, Chinese citizens are unhappy about polluted air. I mean, there’ve been a lot of moves to reduce. We, we don’t see the progress here yet. Coal-fired electrical plants, or at least move them further away from urban areas in places where the environmental destruction resulting from massive industrialization. It’s really hit. We’ve seen protests. We’ve, we, we have seen some change there. But ultimately China has been driven by a very successful effort to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. And so for, for the most part, economic considerations have trumped all, all other considerations. I mean, the great irony is that the, the driver of the kind of globalization that I’m writing about in this book, at the center of it is this, what I describe as a joint venture between the people’s Republic of China. This institution forged under a, a peasant rebellion revolution in under a Marxist Leninist terms and Walmart, the ultimate retailer from the citadel of, of, of western capitalism. And this joint venture has really propelled us through the decades. And that’s what is now changing. 00:37:09 [Speaker Changed] So there’s some really interesting tidbits in the book. I i I have to bring up. Between 1981 and 2000 American companies reduced their inventories by about 2% a year. By 2014, they were holding $1.2 trillion less in inventory than they had been in the eighties. That seems like a giant number. 00:37:36 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it is. Now some of that is reflective of more reliable products. So, so some of that is the part of the Toyota production system that doesn’t get talked about much, which is, you know, quality improvement. So if your parts don’t break as frequently, then you don’t need to hold as many. That’s fine. But we know that every time there’s a shock to the system, we run outta stuff. I mean, the pandemic brought that if, if you didn’t know that before the pandemic, you sure found out about it when we ran out of, you know, everything medicine, right? I mean, that’s the title of my book. But the first supply chain disruption story I ever wrote was back in 1999 when there was an earthquake in Taiwan and we had shortages of chips and other electronics. Then of course the Fukushima did Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011 and into 2012. 00:38:25 We had massive shortages of electronics for months after we had floods in Thailand around the same time that knocked hard drive production outta whack. And each time people who pay attention to this stuff. And that’s a, a fairly geeky set of people would say, I think maybe we’ve overdone it with just in time. But this equation has been so good for the people running publicly traded companies that any CEO who says, I don’t know, maybe we need more of a hedge against trouble, that’s an invitation to go out looking for your next job. The CEO says, let’s keep going lean. They know that eventually there will be a comeuppance. But with any luck that’ll happen after they’ve moved on, they’ve sold their op, they’ve cashed in their options, and then they’re on, you know, some beach and a hammock with a cocktail in their hand. So, 00:39:11 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about what took place before and after the pandemic and some of the data in the book is really quite astonishing. Pre pandemic China made 80% of the fa face masks sold in the US and 90% of many basic antibiotics. Yeah. That just seems insane to me. 00:39:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. In retrospect it’s, I mean it’s certainly insane. 00:39:35 [Speaker Changed] Like, like how can we not make our own antibiotics in, in the United States? I 00:39:39 [Speaker Changed] Mean, what makes it insane is we’re discussing a period where we’re deciding to have a trade war with China. Right? I mean, right now, you know, i I mean if you have a great re I mean, I, I think if we were saying 80% of our face masks are made in Canada, I don’t think we’d give that any thought. Right? ’cause the likelihood that we’re gonna close the border seems pretty small. But yes. To be going into the pandemic simultaneously having this trade war, while we’re heavily dependent for really significant stuff on this country that, you know, happens to be on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, that’s a problem. 00:40:11 [Speaker Changed] So let, let’s talk a little bit about what this looked like. Once the world shuts down by the middle of 2021, 13% of the world’s container shipping fleet, they’re just stuck in traffic jams at ports. They can’t get in or out. Yeah. About a trillion dollars worth of product is just stuck offshore. Te tell us about that. 00:40:33 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Involuntary warehouses, suddenly container ships or involuntary warehouses. You know, I’m tracing in the book the passage of the single shipping container from a factory in China to a warehouse in Mississippi. This is the most important shipment in the history of this startup company based in Mississippi called Glow run by a guy named Hagan Walker. And Hagan Walker’s got this deal with Sesame Street to make these light up bath toys. And this is his first order that’s big enough to fill a 40 foot shipping container. And first, you know, the price of moving a container of goods from the West Co, from coastal China to the west coast to the US goes from like 2,500 bucks to north of $25,000 in the space of a few months. And then by the time he manages to get his stuff on board a ship, there’s 50, 60, 70 ships just floating off the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. These are the two ports that collectively are the gateway for 40% of all imports reaching the US by container ship. And there’s just not enough space on the docks for them to unload. So they’re stuck floating for sometimes for weeks. 00:41:39 [Speaker Changed] So do we not have enough ports or was it just a shortage of port workers and truck drivers and, and railroad cars and even shipping containers themselves that led to this problem? 00:41:53 [Speaker Changed] It’s a little of each of these things all at once. But it’s important to understand that the shipping industry is basically an unregulated cartel, right? Made up of international companies. They’re all foreign companies. They’re organized though there are scores of them into three alliances. Think like airline alliances, like your star alliance or your one world or whatever, right? And these three alliances, they control like 90 plus percent of the traffic across the Pacific. So in the same way that, you know, it’s not an accident that you get on your united flight and every seat’s taken and they’re looking for volunteers ’cause they’re managing inventory so carefully, right? They want you to be anxious about getting space on that flight. So if you really gotta make that trip, you’ll pay whatever it costs. They have a similar, the shipping carriers have that relationship with the people who are dependent upon space on their ships. 00:42:47 So you’ve got limited capacity and, and sorry to back up on you, but there was a, a massive miscalculation by much of international business as the pandemic begins, right? We, we get the first shutdowns in China, we then get disruptions in Europe as the pandemic spreads and we get quarantines people throwing outta work. Unemployment shoots up to 14% in April of 2020 in the US. And people running businesses react to this as if, you know, oh this is familiar, okay, this is a, this is a, a terrible downturn, like the great financial crisis and then the great recession. We just need to slash orders for everything because, you know, people are outta work. So spending powers drying up. Well if they had part of it, right? Yeah. If we’re not gonna offices, then there’s no need for the sandwich shop on the corner. We’re not going to the gym, gyms are shut. 00:43:40 But guess what, we’re now stuck at home cooking, you know, 27 meals a day for our cooped up children. We need more kitchen appliances. We can’t go to the gym. But now we’re buying Pelotons and sticking ’em in our basements. We need more of those. A lot of this stuff’s made in China. So there’s now demand for these container ships to carry them across the ocean. And a lot of the containers have been sent out to places that are bearing face masks and, and gowns and, and other PPE and they’re headed to places that don’t have that much stuff to send back to China. So there’s stacks of containers in, you know, west Africa, in parts of Latin America that don’t do that much trade with China. Just as China’s turning on to make our pelotons and our, you know, bar backyard barbecues and trampolines to entertain our cooped up children. 00:44:28 So shipping price skyrockets and it turns out we actually need more stuff including ships than, than we needed. And at the same time, to your earlier point, we got truck drivers six. So we don’t have as much truck drivers, so we don’t have as much trucking capacity. Dock workers are six, so we don’t have as many people to load and unload. Warehouses are now full. ’cause we don’t have people to move the stuff outta warehouses. So we don’t have places to put all these boxes that are coming in. So they’re piling up on the docks. The whole system just 00:44:59 [Speaker Changed] Buckles it. It’s amazing. And it’s, it’s so hard to imagine what it was like before. ’cause we know how it turned out. And, and today it feels like, how could any of mi one have made that mill miscalculation? It’s so obvious the demand for goods over services was gonna spike. But at that time, not a lot of people saw that coming, did they? It it was a pretty big miscalculation. 00:45:27 [Speaker Changed] It was a big miscalculation. But it also goes back to what we were discussing earlier in terms of shareholder primacy. You know, one of the things that Toyota really valued in its own version of just in time is you have to take care of your suppliers. If things are bad, you don’t just say, well, you know, we disown you. We don’t need any of what you’re making. Good luck to you. Because then when you do need them, they’ll be out of business. Right? But that’s effectively what we did with computer chips. You know, why can’t you find a car that’s got a computer chip? Because the auto companies, well the auto companies made a series of terrible cal miscalculations, right? First of all, they didn’t understand that they didn’t actually matter very much to their ultimate customers, right? The chip fabricators in Taiwan, they thought, well, you know, we’re Ford, we’re gm, we’re, you know, Nissan, whatever. Like they, they have to take care of us. No, they don’t. They’re taking care of Google and Apple. That’s most of their markets. So, and even they, those companies can’t get chips. So whatever chips they can make, they’re going into the iPhone because that’s the big customer. Sorry, Ford, you’re last in line for 00:46:27 [Speaker Changed] Those chips. Well, not quite last because it was 00:46:28 [Speaker Changed] Medical 00:46:28 [Speaker Changed] Device manufacturer. Manufacturer, right. Small med devices and, and some real important lifesaving devices. That’s right. Could not get manufactured according to your book. Correct. 00:46:37 [Speaker Changed] But when you tell a chip manufacturer, Hey, sorry, we don’t need any of what you’re making, we’ll, we’ll call you. When we do, they turn their fabrication plants offline and you can’t just turn a switch on to get that going again. It takes billions of dollars, it takes lots of materials, it takes months. So once we realize that we’ve grossly miscalculated in terms of running the economy, we then have to wait to ramp back up. And that does go, that, that is an indictment of how we’ve done just in time. We haven’t thought about suppliers as, you know, partners. They’re just, suppliers are just costs to be contained. And the same goes for human beings. You know, you go back to what you were saying about McKinsey earlier. One of the things McKinsey did in terms of proselytizing for lean, is they turned human beings and human workers into inventory. Okay? Oh, we don’t need you. Well, we’re just gonna make you flexible. You’re, you’re an independent contractor now, congratulations. That effectively means we own your time. If you’re a warehouse worker or you’re a, a worker in a, in a plant that makes something like, you know, you’re engaged in Biomanufacturing, if we need you, we need to know that. We can tell you a day before that you have to show up for work so you don’t have control of your time. You can’t go on vacation, you can’t schedule, you know, a doctor’s appointment for 00:47:57 [Speaker Changed] Your kid. How do you drop off your kids? How do you do any of that stuff? 00:47:59 [Speaker Changed] Right? But you don’t get paid unless we call you. Well, guess what? The minute unemployment drops to historic standards, people say, you know what? I got other options. I’m gonna pursue them. ’cause I don’t like being treated like inventory. And you go back to Henry Ford who understood that, you know, Henry Ford is not a figure to be lionized, right? He was a racist, he was an anti-Semite, he crushed organized labor. But he understood that if you want workers showing up, giving their all, you gotta pay them. He doubled wages in 1914. Some people called him a communist. He said, I’m just a guy who wants to make product reliably. And any business premised on low wage labor is inherently unstable. We broke that connection. So, so ultimately we lost, we, we have these labor shortages we love to say, but we’re really, we ran out of people willing to continue to sign up for the deal of downgraded jobs. 00:48:53 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk a little bit about that because I, I, I constantly harp on this point, and I feel like so many people don’t understand this. So the decade leading up to, or maybe the two decades leading up to the pandemic post nine 11, the Bush administration changes the rules for who can stay in the United States if they’re here on an education visa, right? We reduced the number of legal immigrants who take a lot of jobs that Americans don’t want. Right? Then we have the pandemic. And so there’s no traffic in or out. I don’t know. Arguably it was close to 2 million people in the US die of, of covid, right? I, I know the official numbers are a little less than that, but it feels like that’s a conservative guess. You have millions of people on disability, millions of people who still have long COVID, all these different factors come together and it creates this massive shortage, right? Of workers in the United States. Of course, unemployment is four point something percent, right? We don’t have enough bodies. How much of this, what you’re describing is just in time inventory for people? How, how much of this traces back to, to that approach? 00:50:09 [Speaker Changed] A lot of it, you know, I mean, I think we heard a lot about how are your stuff’s not showing up because there aren’t enough truck drivers willing to do it as if these guys just lost their mojo to do their jobs. I actually spent three days riding along with a long haul truck driver from Kansas City. It’s 00:50:25 [Speaker Changed] A tough gig, isn’t it? It’s a, 00:50:26 [Speaker Changed] I mean, look, it’s always been a tough gig, but you know, before deregulation and under Carter, people love to talk about Reagan, but a lot of that stuff actually starts with Carter. In the late seventies, the teamsters were in charge. Okay, here’s another institution not to be lionized, you know, they have an unsavory history, but they, they demonstrate the power of having a union because you, you know, you’re away from your family. You’re on the road, you are worried about where to park. You know, that was always true. But these guys got paid really well. I mean, it was, this was a, a truly middle class to upper middle class job. Now it’s basically a working poor job and you’re, you’re away from your family more than ever. You are really at the mercy of, of too much competition in that particular industry where trucking companies are constantly undercutting one of those. 00:51:14 It’s very hard for any of them to make any money. ’cause there’s so many of them. And so they rely on being able to squeeze labor. And that model works so long as there are huge numbers of people so desperate to do anything that they will sign up for. You know, and going back to our earlier discussion of, of, of the mortgage industry before the great financial crisis, there are these predatory schemes, reminiscent of subprime right? In the recruitment of drivers. And a lot of drivers sign off on this pitch that the, you know, the allure, the open road and we’re gonna pay for your training program. But then you’re indentured to the company that paid the training program for six months or sometimes two years. And by the time you figure out this is actually a really bad deal. I’m not getting paid by the hour. 00:51:59 I’m getting paid by load delivered. I’m spending hours and hours just waiting at some port for my container to be available. I’m stuck at outside some warehouse that’s also short of employees waiting for them to unload my freight so I can pick up the next load. I do the math. I’m actually working barely minimum wage in some cases even below a lot of people quit. And so we have this churn where even a successful trucking company has to replace their entire fleet in the sh in the space of a year in any other industry that would be a scandal in trucking. We just accept that that’s how it goes. Well that breaks down once unemployment drops below 5%. Yeah. 00:52:35 [Speaker Changed] One of the fascinating things about the combination of the pandemic and the CARES act that we’re sending people pretty decent sized checks enough that they could live on for, for a couple of months. The highest level of new business formation in American history, 20 21, 22. It seemed like a lot of people figured out, Hey, I gotta find something and if they’re not gonna pay me, I’m gonna figure it out myself. Right? And whether it was creating new apps or just their own little businesses that they were running, it looked like a big swath of Middle America said, I don’t need one of these high efficient corporate jobs for that sort of headache. I, I could figure something out myself. How much of the labor shortage has been driven by people just kind of upskilling and, and saying to corporate America, Hey, I think I have a shot at at, at generating as much as you’re paying me. 00:53:33 [Speaker Changed] I think a lot of it, I mean, certainly in the supply chain, you know, the normalcy that we’re accustomed to where you click your buy button on Amazon and you wait sometimes just a few hours and some somebody shows up at your door, we’re invited not to think about the army of workers behind that. You know, that’s based on large numbers of people being so desperate for a job, especially a job if it happens to pay, have healthcare, that they’re not looking around for anything else. And they’re aware that whatever else is out there probably represents a downgrade. If they’re able to stay in their home and support, support their families. I mean, we know that lots of people who are working in, you know, places like Walmart warehouses who are moving packages in giant Amazon fulfillment centers qualify for food stamps. I mean, they need a federal subsidy courtesy of us, the taxpayer, just to keep themselves fed so they can do those jobs. 00:54:29 [Speaker Changed] Do you remember the mc helpline back in, I wanna say twenty twelve, twenty thirteen? I recall a bunch of news articles that McDonald’s would hire people Oh yeah. And then help them, like Walmart, get all this aid, and it makes you think, wait, you’re spending all this money lobbying to keep the minimum wage low. Right? So if you’re a, if you are a private company, why are you asking me the taxpayer Sure. To subsidize your employees. I don’t care if the burgers 30 cents more. Pay your clients a little. And the fascinating thing about that, I have a vivid recollection, I wanna say it’s 2015, right? Of Amazon announcing we’re gonna pay $15 an hour and scooping up all the best people. And, and they left places like Walmart, right? Scrambling. There was a period where Walmart shelves were empty. Sure. The stores were dirty. Sure. I think Amazon had enough money that they said, we don’t care about a couple of bucks. Let’s just, this is a resource we’re gonna capture. Right. We we’re gonna monopolize this resource. Right. 00:55:26 [Speaker Changed] Well, so a lot of that was reflective of the fact that you have huge numbers of people who are just so busy doing two jobs, driving vast distances to keep the job they’ve got, that they don’t have time to think about, well, what alternate career could I pursue? That’s like thinking about going to the moon, right? Well, suddenly the pandemic shuts everything down and you are now having to contemplate whether you want to or not, some other way to feed your family. That was such a shakeup At the same time that we do have emergency unemployment benefits that are taking the edge off and allowing people to continue to, to spend on their basic needs. And we have unemployment drops so much that suddenly people who are not accustomed to thinking about alternatives, you know, what else is out there? Let’s check it out. Maybe I will start a small business. You 00:56:16 [Speaker Changed] Talk about the meat packing industry in the book that also ran into not just shipping problems, but worker problems. What made the meat packing industry so unusually at risk to supply chain problems? 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] Well, it, it’s a perfect example of this. Engineered scarcity is the term that I use where, because, you know, one of the types of deregulation that we’ve had that’s been so disastrous because we eliminated antitrust enforcement. This goes back to Reagan continues through every presidential administration on both sides of the aisle until this break under Biden, we’ve got four companies that are in control of 85% of the meat packing capacity in the United States. I mean, that’s a number that’s higher than during the Robert Baron era. So guess what? They’re setting themselves up so that the cattle ranchers in selling their animals have few alternatives which keeps prices low on the front end. You know, the people they’re paying have no pricing power, right? So they’re getting the animals cheaper at the other end where they’re distributing to restaurants, to consumers, grocery chains and the like. 00:57:33 They, they are benefiting anytime there’s a shock to the system. So they’re getting record high retail prices or, or wholesale prices that are translating into retail prices. At the same time, the cattle ranchers are going outta business because they’re getting a smaller slice of the dollar that we’re spending on, on, on beef, and they’re working the system. So they get the Trump administration in the first wave of the pandemic to drop an executive order that says, slaughterhouse workers are essential. Workers have to continue showing up even when local public health authorities say, actually these slaughterhouses their super spreaders. Right. What I discovered in researching the book is at the time that, so I tell this story, this one woman tin I who’s an immigrant from Myanmar who actually dies, and the jb well, she contracts covid and dies the first wave. She worked at a JBS slaughterhouse outside of Denver. At the time that the Trump administration is parroting industry talking points, these people are essential workers. If they don’t keep showing up for work, we are not gonna be able to get fed. Right. The meat packers are actually sitting on record volumes of frozen meat, and they’re boosting their exports, including to places like China. So we essentially sacrifice the lives of these slaughterhouse workers, not to feed Americans to, to continue to funnel monopoly profits to, to a handful of companies. So, 00:58:55 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about those profits, and I wanna talk about a data point in the book. When, when the phrase greed deflation first started circulating in mid 2021, I had a list of, you know, 15 things that, that were contributing to inflation. And I think I had greed. Deflation was 13. I was pretty skeptical of it. Yeah. And then as time went on, there was more and more data coming out Sure. That said, Hey, we’re seeing record profits. And it looks like a lot of this is, is a little opportunistic. The data point that you have in the book. By the time inflation is peaking in June of 2022, more than half of the price increases in US goods we’re going to increase profits. A mere 8% found its way to to workers. So it seems like the greed, deflation narrative turned out to be pretty right. 00:59:51 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. And the thing is, this was not a surprise to anybody listening to the earnings calls because the executives of companies like Kroger, you know, the giant supermarket chain publicly, well, you know, we’re having to shell out more. There are all these supply chain disruptions. Our prices are going up. So unfortunately our costs have to go up. Meanwhile, they’re telling Wall Street analysts, this is fantastic. You know, we, this is the greatest opportunity we’ve ever had to jack up our margins because everyone’s rising lifting their prices, you know, collectively. So nobody’s gonna point the finger at us. 01:00:26 [Speaker Changed] Historically, people don’t realize this. Historically, stocks have always been a great inflation hedge. ’cause when prices rise, well, it just gets passed along. Sure. And then profits rise either the same or more. And if your stock price is a function of your profits, well guess what? It’s a great hedge against inflation. It’s not gold. It’s stocks that are the good inflation hedge. 01:00:51 [Speaker Changed] I mean, the question is, and, and this is something I get into in detail in the book, the question is, are we talking about an industry where there’s truly competition or not? If there’s competition, then you’re limited in how much you can jack up prices, because presumably your competitor will say, well, I’ll accept a slightly lower margin for greater market share that’s actually free market capitalism. But, 01:01:10 [Speaker Changed] But it didn’t feel like that happened in 21 or 22. It kind of felt like, Hey, no one’s gonna notice if I make this package a little smaller. Right. Or if we raise, like everything is just gonna get lost in this giant surge of prices and who’s gonna really know. But 01:01:28 [Speaker Changed] Beneath a lot of this, it turns out, is market concentration and various forms of collusion. I mean, oh, what, what a coincidence. Every time one airline lifts their fare from New York to la the other ones Go ahead. You know, how interesting that, you know, this just happens to be how it works out, you know, every single time. You know, why is that we don’t have enough competition and there’s no transparency in the marketplace. And you know, everybody knows that if you walk into the casino thinking that you’re the smartest guy, well you’re the sucker because there’s a lot of data operative behind you. And that’s the world that we’re living in. This is, this is not competition most of the time. 01:02:09 [Speaker Changed] And, and we have since learned that a lot of the algorithms and software that are being used to set prices also contribute to that conclusion most recently with rents, landlords, and rents. Yeah, that’s right. That, hey, these guys have kind of figured out that this algorithm is, is colluding to drive Sure. Rents higher. Yeah. Because we have access to all this data and oh, we know what those guys are charging and we know what those guys are charging. So we could, we could bump up to that level. And it’s, it seems that if you’re putting software in charge and all the landlords are using the same piece of software, right? Hey, that very much looks like collusion. 01:02:46 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, that’s, that, that’s absolutely right. And you know, my favorite example of this recently is we, we just had this dock worker strike on the Eastern Gulf Coast of the United States, and there were all of these breathless stories, but this is such a terrible time for the shipping industry. You know, they can’t move any of this cargo. Well, guess what happened after they settled the strike? The stocks of the companies that are publicly traded plummeted. Why did they plummet? Because anybody who understands the container shipping industry gets that engineered scarcity is the name of the game. And when there’s a shock to the system, if you can’t move cargo, they’re gonna jack up freight rates globally way in excess of their underlying cost. So the market said, oh no, the strike’s over, we’re back to normal. That’s my chance to, to sell off at the, in the, in the same way that, you know, we’ve got the, the Houthis in Yemen opening fire on vessels, headed toward the Suez Canal, effectively shutting the canal, making ships that are going from Asia to Europe, go the long way around Africa Fed analysts tell me that probably increased cost for shipping companies by maybe 40%. 01:03:56 I mean this, oh, really? Increased diesel costs, you know, more labor costs. Well, shipping rates are up three and 400%. That’s fatter margins. So when there’s a shock to the system, if there’s no competition, that gets expressed as pricing power, which means we all pay more. 01:04:14 [Speaker Changed] So, so since the pandemic, the new administration has focused on re industrializing the United States nearshoring, or in-house shoring, or whatever you wanna call it, what is the state of manufacture? Reshoring is the phrase I was looking for. What is the state of of bringing manufacturing back to the United States? How long will it take before we can have a little more resilience built into our own system? Well, 01:04:44 [Speaker Changed] We’re gonna get more resilience, you know, over the next decade or or two. You know, we’re globalization’s not over, by the way. Like my book is not a call for making everything in America that would be extremely expensive. It would be wrenching and disruptive. It, it is a call for greater actual resilience alongside this kind of ruthless efficiency. And it’s not real efficiency, as we’ve discussed. It’s really about catering to these metrics. So, you know, in strategic industries like semiconductors medicines and the medicine supply chain electric vehicles where the Biden administration is now handing out tens of billions of dollars in subsidies. Right. We do see a real construction boom. And, and actually it’s been interesting to see that a lot of the investment is going into places that were hit hardest during the, so-called China Shock, North Carolina, Michigan, you know, getting a lot, Arizona, Arizona, you know, getting a lot of this investment into these emerging, you know, future facing industries. In other industries, especially where labor costs still matter. It, it’s unlikely that this stuff’s gonna come back to the us. 01:05:55 [Speaker Changed] So we’re not making furniture, we’re not making clothes here, really didn’t treat great 01:05:59 [Speaker Changed] Numbers. We’re not making tube socks. And the Carolinas again, you know, but, but instead of making it all in China, we’ll make ’em in Central America. We’ll make ’em in Mexico, we’ll make ’em in India. So there’s a hedge against reliance. I mean, it’s not that we’re abandoning China, by the way. I mean, China’s going to continue to be a very significant center of manufacturing. It’s that there’s a sort of portfolio rebalancing, and I, I, I would put it to you this way, we’ve talked a lot about Walmart. 15 years ago, if you were, if you had a product that you were trying to get on the shelves of a Walmart superstore and you flew down to Bentonville, Arkansas to pitch the Walmart buyers on your product, you have to go see them. They don’t come see you. It’s like visiting the pope, you know? 01:06:39 Right. And you get your appointment and they would ask you, where are you making this product? And if your answer was something other than China, you had a problem because they would assume that you couldn’t be getting the lowest possible price. You weren’t making it at the most efficient scale. Well now if you go to Bentonville, you got your product, Walmart says, where are you making it? And if your answer is only China, you have a problem. They want to hear, well, what’s your backup plan? You know, we, we don’t want to get stuck waiting for container ships to come in to LA to serve our customers in, you know, Oklahoma City. So are you making it in Mexico? Are you looking to India? Are you moving some stuff to Vietnam? There, there’s gotta be a greater mix. And that, that is happening to an extent, but I am dubious that it will continue to happen the longer away we get from the pandemic for the simple reason that, you know, you’re an incentives guy, I’m an incentives guy. The incentives for a publicly traded company are still quarter by quarter lowest possible cost. So if you’re the CEO of a company and you’re saying, well, let’s spend a little more for redundancy, let’s have a second factory in Mexico. If you’re diluting next quarter’s earnings or the quarter after that, this is a good chance you won’t be around to get the praise whenever the inevitable next shock materializes that will reveal that. That’s a good strategy. 01:07:59 [Speaker Changed] So globalization, not dead resiliency, not as important or fundamental as we might’ve been led to believe over the past few months. I 01:08:08 [Speaker Changed] Mean, there’s certainly a change to the talking points, right? McKinsey now talks about just in case instead of just in time. But we gotta watch to see if these lessons will really get learned because the shareholder’s interest is still with us. 01:08:22 [Speaker Changed] Huh? What are you watching these days or listening to? What, what’s keeping you entertained? 01:08:26 [Speaker Changed] I’ve been rewatching The Sopranos. Oh really? You haven’t watched it since it came out? 01:08:30 [Speaker Changed] How’s it hold up? It’s 01:08:31 [Speaker Changed] Great. Yeah, it’s, yeah, it’s hilarious. I forgot how funny it is. 01:08:35 [Speaker Changed] Oh, it was always very 01:08:36 [Speaker Changed] Funny. It was always very funny. So well acted obviously, just really well written it so well-written, and I also re-watched Succession. See, from beginning to end. I, 01:08:45 [Speaker Changed] I, I tried a couple of times to watch succession. I like by the second episode, it’s like each one of these people, and I know the, you’re right, everything I’ve read, the writing is great. It is. This is, and I just couldn’t, I just couldn’t find myself, you know, interested in anybody. It’s like weird. You don’t, like, it’s like no character you like 01:09:09 [Speaker Changed] As a guy who lived through one of the most grotesque mergers of all time, which is a OL purchasing HuffPost 01:09:14 [Speaker Changed] Time Warner. Yeah. 01:09:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Well, I wasn’t a Time Warner. No, I was, this is the, the what’s left of a OL buying HuffPost. Oh, okay. When, when I, when I had a senior leadership position in the newsroom. Yeah. It was so interesting to there, there’s a merger in the fourth se in the last season of succession where you’ve got like the public facing, like synergies, magic. And meanwhile you got these two characters who are like screwed and they’re just desperate to consummate this deal as a way to kind of wipe away their problems and keep the whole Ponzi scheme going. That was so true to me in terms of what I lived through that Yeah. It, I I’m willing to, you’re right. These are not sympathetic 01:09:54 [Speaker Changed] People, but, but everybody seems to lo love it. It it’s, that’s a great show. You, you know, what I watched during the Pandemic that I hadn’t seen in real time. And it was just one of those things. What you never saw, this was Mad Men. Oh, it’s great. Was sort of your Yeah. Fantastic. You rewatching Sopranos Yeah. Was me watching Mad Men for the first time. And even though there are some complex characters that have good, good sides and bad sides, there’s still people you root for in are empathetic. That’s true. And I, I just found it to be 01:10:25 [Speaker Changed] Madman is incredible. 01:10:26 [Speaker Changed] How did I miss this the first time around? Sort of the, 01:10:28 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s just, that’s an amazing show. 01:10:29 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Really. All right. Let, let’s, let’s go on, let’s talk about your mentors who helped shape your fascinating career. 01:10:37 [Speaker Changed] Well, thanks for that. I, I had a couple of old school newspaper people I sat next to in the first newsroom I ever worked in, which was at the Anchorage Daily News in Alaska. It was a columnist named Mike Dugan and a reporter named Sheila Toomey. They were veterans. And I just listened to them working their sources on the phone and, you know, giving ’em a hard time holding people to account. And I just thought it was so thrilling and I that it, it really a, a affected how I go about it, the how dogged they were. When I got to the Washington Post, I was lucky enough to spend time with Steve Call, who’s one of the all time greats. And every time I would talk to him about a story, I would come away with like a, a new understanding of the historic significance of whatever it was that I was covering. And I’ve always tried to think about every story is like, what does this mean as like a letter to somebody in the future? What does this signify that’s broader than just the thing that I’m writing about that I thought the Washington Post in that period was very good 01:11:35 [Speaker Changed] At. Let, let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:11:41 [Speaker Changed] I’m reading Isabel Wilkerson’s, the Warmth of Other Sons, which is this fantastic narrative history of the black migration from the south to northern cities, which is a, a period that I realize I just don’t know enough about, but it’s just so important in terms of 01:11:56 [Speaker Changed] Post Civil War, pre-World War I, that sort 01:11:59 [Speaker Changed] Of area. Yeah. This is like from World War I in into the 1970s. And it’s just so significant in terms of affecting the politics and of course, race dimensions and, and, and class and, and American culture. And it’s, it’s, it’s just a beautifully written book. You know, I’m, I, I’ve always loved Steinbeck. I was very influenced early in my career by, by Norman Mailers, nonfiction. I like this idea of like, the best work is, is the reported stuff that, that unfolds like a novel. The Executioner song had a great effect on me, a Tom Wolf stuff. I feel like I’m just dating myself now, 01:12:36 [Speaker Changed] But so, so when you say Tom Wolf the Right Stuff or Bon Bonfire, the values 01:12:42 [Speaker Changed] Is fantastic. Yeah. I, I like his VII think Bonfire of the Vanities is really entertaining, very insightful book in lots of ways. I’m a sucker for Michael Lewis. I mean, there’s names, 01:12:53 [Speaker Changed] Anything he writes. Yeah, 01:12:54 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. The Big Short certainly is a amazing, I loved Moneyball. I’m a big baseball fan. 01:12:58 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, Moneyball was one. In fact, just look at his past half Dozen works e each one more Fascinating. He’s yeah, he’s amazing than the next, the Undoing project was absolutely fascinating. Haven’t gotten to that yet. Oh really? Yeah. I gotta do that. About Kahneman and Ky. Yeah, I gotta that and essentially the invention of behavioral finance, which ca by the way, the, the, if you read the introduction of the book, you find out that after he writes Moneyball, he gets an email from Dick Thaylor and Kas Sunstein who said, Hey, everything you’re talking about was Ky and Kahneman, huh. All of the the alternative ways of looking at data dates to them in, at first in Israel and then in the us You should, you should talk to, you should talk to them. Yeah. Oh, and PS Amos Dki, who’s no longer with us, his wife lives right up the street from you. At Berkeley. At Berkeley, yeah. Such, and that’s what led to that. Amazing. Really. If you’re interested in Yeah, I strong recommendation fast my list. 01:13:56 [Speaker Changed] Okay. 01:13:58 [Speaker Changed] Our last two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a college grad interested in a career in, in journalism, in freelancing, in economics? What, what advice would you give to them? 01:14:10 [Speaker Changed] It’s real simple. Just write, do find something that allows you to just write and write and write, because there’s just no substitute. You can’t develop the muscles without doing it. It’s as simple as that. And writing a deadline is super useful. Covering a beat is incredibly useful in terms of helping you develop judgment. But whatever you’re doing that involves finding stuff out and writing will make you better at it. 01:14:34 [Speaker Changed] Huh. And our final question, what do you know about the world of investigative reporting, economics, journalism in general that would’ve been helpful 30 or 40 years ago when you were first getting started? 01:14:48 [Speaker Changed] The power of one or two deeply reported cases is much greater than the over-reporting spreading too thin that I think most of us, when we’re young, tend to do, we don’t have the judgment developed yet to say like, I’m gonna stay right here and I’m gonna dig deep into this.

Title: Futures retreat from post-election gains as focus shifts to economic data

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -Wall Street's main indexes fell on Tuesday as investors booked profits from post-election gains and awaited U.S. inflation data due in the coming days. The three major indexes had rallied to record highs since the Nov. 5 U.S. election as investors bet on a boost to equities from President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tax cuts and the prospect of easier regulatory policies. But investor enthusiasm was dampened on Tuesday. European shares lost 2% as European Central Bank policymakers warned that increased tariffs from Trump would hamper global growth. Some of the stocks expected to perform well under Trump gave back gains. Shares in electric car maker Tesla were down close to 5% after rising nearly 40% since the election results. The small-cap Russell 2000 index fell 1.5% after closing at a three-year high on Monday. Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial, said the decline in stocks overseas pressured U.S. stocks, along with profit-taking after the rally and ahead of inflation data. "When we opened up already experiencing some downside with the very strong run that we've had, investors tend to look to take some profits just in case stocks continue to slide," Price said. On investors' radar is Wednesday's consumer price inflation data, followed by producer prices inflation and retail sales data this week, that are expected to provide clues about the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy path going forward. The data presents a near-term risk to investments, said Price. "It very likely is contributing to a little bit of the downside that we're seeing today." At 2:31 p.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 230.63 points, or 0.52%, to 44,062.50, the S&P 500 lost 6.20 points, or 0.10%, to 5,995.15 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.25 points, or 0.02%, to 19,295.51. Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors, materials and utilities led declines with more than 1% losses while consumer staples was among the biggest gainers. Markets have already dialed back expectations for interest-rate reductions over the next year, given strong economic data and the possible inflationary impact of some Trump policies. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank is ready to respond if inflation pressures rise or the job market weakens. The blue-chip Dow was weighed down by declines in healthcare and financial stocks, including UnitedHealth and Goldman Sachs, both off around 1%. Biotech firm Novavax dropped 5.8% after cutting its annual revenue forecast due to lower-than-expected sales of its COVID-19 vaccine. Honeywell hit a record high and was last up 3% after activist investor Elliott Investment said it has built a stake worth more than $5 billion in the industrial conglomerate. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3.25-to-1 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange where there were 281 new highs and 91 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,350 stocks rose and 2,885 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.14-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 51 new 52-week highs and 15 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 177 new highs and 109 new lows.

Title: I was laid off from Amazon, rejoined, and quit less than 3 months later. I should've seen the writing on the wall.

I should've seen the writing on the wall — the company has changed. I'd rather have no job than work for a company I no longer respect. When I first joined Amazon in 2017, I felt very fortunate to work there. As a program manager working with the company's middle and last-mile operations teams, I had a great boss who knew Amazon's culture inside and out. I loved how our senior leaders valued evidence and logic over status; if you had the data, no matter your level, people listened. I loved that we spoke in the language of Amazon's leadership principles in the hallways and in meetings. "I really loved your Bias for Action there," a colleague would say, referring to the value placed on speed. I could see myself continuing to "work hard, have fun, make history" at Amazon for years to come. But in January 2023, in the middle of a personal health scare, I was one of the 18,000 employees laid off. Scared and angry, I took a 12-week severance and a small health insurance stipend. I'd dreamt for years about taking a career break but didn't feel financially secure, so I began doing part-time instructional design work as a sole proprietor while I figured out what was next. A year later, I got the opportunity to return to Amazon as a boomerang employee. I took it, but I quickly realized that the innovative, exciting work environment I remembered was gone, replaced by what I felt was ineffective leadership and a disproportionate focus on share prices. Eleven weeks after rejoining, I resigned. Here are the four red flags that told me Amazon's culture had changed. In January 2024, a former colleague reached out to me about a role that would be opening up on his team. Despite my poor layoff experience, I was enticed by the idea of rejoining Amazon and began looking for other roles on LinkedIn. I made it to the final-round interview loop for a senior product manager role. Four of the five interviews felt familiar, but my interview with the "bar raiser" — an Amazon employee specifically trained in interview skills to advise the hiring team on how to raise the bar with each new hire — felt different. At the end of the interview, I asked her how things had changed after the layoffs. She responded, knowing that I had been laid off, that the layoffs were a positive challenge for her team as they had to do more with less. Her response was a punch in the gut. So layoffs were a good thing? I'd always been told that a value at Amazon was to treat "the candidate as a customer," but didn't experience that. About a week later the recruiter shared that the team felt I would make a stronger program manager than product manager and asked me to do another interview loop for that role. I declined and told the recruiter that a second full round of interviews was duplicative and unnecessary. I ended up being offered the role and declined it because of my sour interview process. Looking back, I should have seen my interview experience as a sign of how Amazon had changed. A few weeks later, in May 2024, I accepted a different offer from Amazon for a Nashville-based role on another team I'd applied for. I was living in Atlanta and moved to Nashville to adhere to the 3-day-a-week in-office policy. Relocating was a big decision, but I felt excited to rejoin the Amazon I knew and loved, despite the interview process hiccup. Even before my first day of the new job, I saw another example of how Amazon's culture had changed: uneven implementation of return-to-office policies. I couldn't pick up my computer at the office; instead, I had to get it shipped to a non-office address. There were no assigned desks, only "agile seating." Each day I was in the office, I had to find an open desk on my assigned floor and if I wanted to store stuff at work, I had to get a locker. My onboarding that first week was entirely virtual, and I never saw any of my teammates in the office, as they all worked in different cities. And there was a two-year waitlist to get parking at my office building — my recruiter called it a "parking hellscape." It made me question: Why did I relocate my life for an in-person office experience that didn't exist? I joined the newly created content team, which my boss had taken over nine months prior. In my third week, my boss mentioned that another person on another team might take on the content strategy work he'd hired me for. In my fourth week, I was invited to a last-minute meeting, which felt ominously similar to my layoff call one year prior, and was told that the whole content team was being dissolved. I was told that my group's leadership team had been considering this move since Q4 of 2023. Despite knowing about the team's likely demise, my boss still hired four people in the two months leading up to the team being disbanded. In my previous six years at Amazon, I had never encountered these sorts of pivots. It seemed like Amazon's burgeoning bureaucracy had created an environment of no accountability. The Amazon I joined in 2016 prided itself in being "peculiar." Instead of making PowerPoint presentations, we prepared for monthly business reviews by writing six-page narratives designed to help us make data-driven decisions. Each meeting started with everyone, including directors and VPs, reading those documents for 15 to 30 minutes before starting a line-by-line discussion. When I rejoined this year, I found that people were still writing six-pagers, but they didn't seem to understand the purpose anymore. The documents didn't have the polish or data to allow in-depth discussion of the facts. Instead, the conversation would veer to topics the leaders were interested in. It seemed documents, and all the effort behind them, had become the epitome of make-work rather than a unique way to produce essential decision-making tools. A few weeks after my team was dissolved, I met with my new team leader and teammates to map out our work. I realized I saw very little of what I'd signed on to do. My layoff should've been the writing on the wall — this place has changed — but I clung to the idea of the Amazon I'd once respected, not wanting to recognize what it had become. Over and over, I hoped things would improve, but I grew tired. I knew quitting would come with a high financial cost — I'd have to return my sign-on bonus and pay for my move to Nashville — but in October 2024, eleven weeks into my Amazon return, I resigned. I decided I'd rather have no job than work for a company I didn't trust or respect anymore. In his recent letter about the five-day RTO plans, CEO Andy Jassy described reducing layers of leadership to increase employees' ability to move fast, take ownership, and increase innovation for customers. That only solves half the problem. Amazon has too many layers of management and too many ineffectual leaders. The Amazon I joined in 2016 thrummed a "fail fast and often" mentality, encouraging risk-taking that led to delightful innovations. The Amazon I rejoined in 2024 slogs along play-acting the peculiar ways, creating an environment of process obsession instead of customer obsession. I hope they can right the ship, but I won't be around to find out. In response to Business Insider's inquiry, Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said that Amazon was ranked second on LinkedIn's Top Companies list this year and first in LinkedIn's Top Companies in Technology and Information. Stephanie Ramos writes about life and finance as a corporate escapee and single, child-free woman on Substack.

Title: Disney earnings are coming. Here's what to watch for

Disney (DIS+4.08%), one of the oldest and most beloved entertainment brands in the world, is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday morning. The media conglomerate will give investors an update on its efforts to adapt to the ever changing media landscape where streaming is playing an increasingly central role. Disney stock is up over 13% since the beginning of the year, outperforming most of its rivals like Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD-7.61%) and Paramount Global (PARA-3.74%), which have fallen about 16% and 22% over the past 10 months, respectively. Netflix (NFLX-2.32%) still dominates the sector with its share price skyrocketing over 77% since the start of the year. On Thursday, Wall Street analysts will be looking to see how Disney is growing its streaming division – which became profitable last quarter, the state of its other segments like linear TV (broadcast and cable networks) and its theme parks, and any new info on the search for CEO Bob Iger’s successor. Here is what to look for in Disney’s upcoming earnings report: It took Disney five years, since the launch of Disney+, to finally turn a profit within its streaming business. Last quarter, Disney reported that its streaming division, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ turned a profit for the first time. “This was a strong quarter for Disney, driven by excellent results in our entertainment segment both at the box office and in [direct-to-consumer], as we achieved profitability across our combined streaming businesses for the first time and a quarter ahead of our previous guidance,” said Iger in a press release at the time. The company had previously anticipated to turn a profit in this division in its fourth fiscal quarter. In a call with investors in August, Iger said that the company’s goal now is to grow user engagement on its DTC services. “We see the biggest opportunity at DT, where recent price increases and content releases should support another year of mid-teens revenue growth and operating profit of more than $1 billion inclusive of incremental investment in content and tech infrastructure,” wrote Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris in a note in October. Deutsche Bank (DB+0.93%) Research analyst Bryan Kraft wrote in a recent note that Disney’s new bundle with Max should have helped with subscriber growth in the fourth quarter. He added, that recent price increases and a crackdown on password sharing should “yield benefits in F2025, while profitability continues to improve, albeit at a slower pace than F2024.” Comcast (CMCSA-1.35%), the parent company of NBC and the streaming platform Peacock, joined Warner Bros. Discover in mulling over a spinoff of its struggling linear TV assets. Could Disney be next? Although Disney’s streaming business is growing, the media giant continues to struggle — like other media companies — with its traditional television assets, which include its broadcast network ABC; and its cable channels Disney Channel, National Geographic, and FX. The company reported in August that its operating income from its linear networks fell 6% to $966 million in its third fiscal quarter, from $1 billion in the same quarter in 2023. Disney’s television division was also hit with layoffs this summer. Additionally, Disney is expected to report negative impacts from a blackout on DirecTV earlier this year. “Linear networks and sports were impacted by the DirecTV blackout and continue to face secular headwinds on affiliate volumes and ratings,” Kraft wrote. Disney’s theme parks and other experiences — like its cruise ships — are also expected to report declines in the fourth quarter, as this segment of the company was impacted by several disruptions like hurricanes Helene and Milton and a drop in demand in Europe during the Paris Olympics. “Experiences is set up to have its lowest operating income quarter since 2022 due to softer domestic Parks performance, weather-related closures worldwide, pre-opening costs for new cruise ships, cyclical softness in Shanghai, and the Olympics’ impact on Paris,” wrote Kraft. Overall, demand for the company’s parks is slowing from a bump following the pandemic. Raymond James (RJF+0.12%) analyst Ric Prentiss wrote in a note in October that “parks attendance and pricing power is slowing meaningfully.” Investors will also be on the look out for any new info on the search for Iger’s replacement. Disney said in October that it would announce Iger’s successor in early 2026, as it looks to replace its CEO — again. The search — which will include could internal and external candidates — will be led by Disney’s new chairman James P. Gorman. Gorman joined Disney’s board in February. He is stepping down from his role as executive chairman of Morgan Stanley’s (MS+0.69%) board later this year. In August, Gorman was tasked with the difficult job of leading the search committee for Disney’s next CEO — a job that didn’t go so well the first time, as Iger and his successor Bob Chapek’s relationship soured almost immediately due to differences in leadership style. Iger, who has been with the media behemoth for four decades, served as its CEO from 2005 to 2020. He later became executive chairman before retiring in 2021. Iger returned to the company just a year later to serve a two-year term as CEO — taking his role back from Chapek — which has since been extended. He is now expected to leave the company in 2026. The front-runners to replace Iger as CEO include Disney Entertainment co-chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman; Disney Experiences chairman Josh D’Amaro, and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro.

Title: AppLovin stands out in the latest round of quarterly earnings calls

Expires Today: Save $200 on Programmatic Marketing Summit passes. Ends Nov. 15 Expires Today: Save $200 on Programmatic Marketing Summit passes. Ends Nov. 15 In recent weeks, the ad tech sector’s publicly traded companies released their official earnings figures, offering insights into the industry’s critical underpinning developments. Yesterday (November 11), Zeta delivered its Q3 earnings call, noting that revenues soared 42% year over year to hit $268 million. It also increased its quarterly earnings guidance to $297 million (up $32 million), noting that its recent purchase of LiveIntent will help buoy earnings. Earlier during the period, the intuitive talisman of the sector, The Trade Desk, posted its (now expected) quarterly revenue increase – up 27% year on year to $628 million – during the period. Still, it was the performance of AppLovin during the three months to September 30 that (arguably) proved most notable in the latest raft of earnings. AppLovin’s overall Q3 revenue hit $1.2 billion, representing a 39% year-on-year increase, with the outfit additionally forecasting between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion in Q4 revenue. As a result, AppLovin’s market capitalization soared in the days following its latest earnings call, with its stock price easily surpassing that of Trade Desk to near $100 billion, with executives there pouring cold water on speculation that it may be exploring inorganic growth. “We’ve got the largest mediation solution in the sector and our teams built maybe the most innovative advertising technology that the world’s yet seen,” cofounder, chairman, and CEO Adam Foroughi. “And we’re now scaling it out. And so, if you sort of just fast-forward over the quarters and the years from here, we’re going to be able to service tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of advertisers on our platform to access this audience that they had never accessed before.” However, AppLovin CFO Matt Stumpf moved to clarify its intention for “growing the organic [advertising] business” when asked about press speculation on potential mergers and acquisitions by analysts. He said, “We have no plans, right, to do any M&A at this point on the advertising side of the business.” Separately, The Trade Desk Jeff Green underlined how his company has positioned itself as an alternative to the industry’s walled gardens and its shrinking reliance on ad tech’s historic targeting, i.e., third-party cookies, by underlining CTV’s role in its revenues. “2024 has been a banner year for CTV, and we have further cemented our position as the first-choice platform to help leading brands as they continue to shift their budgets from linear TV and UGC into CTV,” he said, noting how video represented just below half of its overall revenues during the period. Meanwhile, Magnite posted overall Q3 revenue of $161 million, representing a 9% year-on-year increase, with further revenue guidance between $170 million and $175 million during Q4, with executives there eager to trumpet its CTV efforts and curation efforts. “For the quarter, our year-over-year growth rate and contribution ex-TAC from CTV accelerated to 23% from a 12% growth rate in Q2,” said Michael Barrett, CEO of Magnite, making a note of its partnerships with Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Rooku, and Warner Bros. Discovery. “There’s an ongoing industry shift toward curation on the sell side, and it’s being fueled in part by signal loss on the demand side, where data collection is becoming more restricted due to privacy changes in browsers and devices,” said Barrett, noting revenue from this part of its business “has grown over 100% year over year… the sell side, there’s no better home for curation than the SSP, where it’s easiest for premium publishers to lie with their peers to attract spend.” Elsewhere, Criteo’s leadership touted its partnership with Microsoft as evidence of how its bet on retail media will offset the declines in its traditional (cookie-based) ad retargeting business, which produced an overall quarterly revenue of $459 million, down 2% year over year. Similarly, LiveRamp was keen to trumpet how its data business saw a boost from Oracle’s exit from the ads business, with revenues coming in at $185 million during the period, a jump from $160 million 12 months earlier. Meanwhile, DoubleVerify saw revenues increase 18% to hit $196.6 million, although CEO Mark Zagorski noted some of the company’s (and broader sector’s) vulnerabilities to the whims of advertisers and dependence on the policy decisions of platforms such as Google and Meta. “Six large customers scale back on ad spend that had our most premium products attached to it. In addition, we saw ad dollars incrementally shift from open exchange programmatic to walled gardens, where our activation solutions aren’t yet available,” he told analysts, noting the company closed approximately 70% of the RFPs it acted upon after Oracle’s summer exit from the ad game. On November 12, DoubleVerify’s main rival, Integral Ad Science — itself the subject of multi-billion dollar takeover speculation — is set to issue its Q3 earnings the same day as PubMatic, which is duking it out with DSPs for more significant sway in the ad market (just like Magnite). Regardless of the numbers, analysts setting the valuations of such companies will likely pay more interest to the developments in the (almost over) Google ad tech trial coming November 25. This is when closing arguments from either side are scheduled to take place, the outcome of which could see Google’s sell-side offering broken up in a development that would fundamentally reshape the competitive landscape for each of the above companies. Done right, curation is a win-win: more efficient reach for advertisers and a revenue bump for publishers. Agency strategists and cultural experts told Digiday they expect some marketers to turn towards more “conservative” messaging. With backing from Campbell’s, Rao’s is spending more to show up in live sports and events with the hope of reaching a national audience.

Title: Nvidia, Intel, and other chip stocks are dragging down the Nasdaq even as the Dow gains

Chip stocks dragged down the Nasdaq on Monday despite gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. Shares of Intel (INTC-2.46%) were down by around 4.1% during midday trading, while Arm’s (SFTBY-1.68%) shares were down over 5%. Broadcom’s (AVGO-3.87%) stock was down by almost 3%, Qualcomm (QCOM-2.03%) was down by around 2.2%, and Micron (MU-2.85%) was down by around 3.5%. Nvidia’s (NVDA-4.19%) shares were down by 1.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD-2.87%) stock faired slightly better, being down by around 1.3%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM-1.88%) U.S.-listed shares joined other chipmakers in the decline and were down by around 4.2%. The fall follows news that the U.S. has reportedly ordered the company not to send advanced artificial intelligence chips to China anymore. The world’s largest chipmaker was told to stop shipping advanced AI chips to Chinese customers starting Monday, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The U.S. Department of Commerce told the Taiwanese chipmaker in a letter that it is imposing export restrictions on advanced chips made with the 7-nanometer process or smaller, the person said. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 saw green Monday as stocks continued a post-election rally sparked by former President Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. Bitcoin also surged on the election victory, reaching a record $84,000. With Trump’s return to the White House, the chip war between the U.S. and China could escalate. Under Trump’s first administration, Chinese tech giant Huawei was placed on the U.S. Entity List in 2019 after the government determined it had “been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Other Chinese semiconductor firms have been added to the list to restrict U.S. companies from sending equipment for advanced chip manufacturing. TSMC has also reportedly told its Chinese customers it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7-nanometer process or beyond starting Monday, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The chipmaker reportedly made the decision to cut off Chinese firms to improve internal controls and in anticipation of updated U.S. export controls on chips sold to China by the outgoing Biden administration. TSMC is also reportedly worried about being targeted by the incoming Trump administration, which has accused Taiwan of stealing chip manufacturing from the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Chip stocks dragged down the Nasdaq on Monday despite gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. Shares of Intel (INTC-2.46%) were down by around 4.1% during midday trading, while Arm’s (SFTBY-1.68%) shares were down over 5%. Broadcom’s (AVGO-3.87%) stock was down by almost 3%, Qualcomm (QCOM-2.03%) was down by around 2.2%, and Micron (MU-2.85%) was down by around 3.5%. Nvidia’s (NVDA-4.19%) shares were down by 1.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD-2.87%) stock faired slightly better, being down by around 1.3%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM-1.88%) U.S.-listed shares joined other chipmakers in the decline and were down by around 4.2%. The fall follows news that the U.S. has reportedly ordered the company not to send advanced artificial intelligence chips to China anymore.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Morgan Stanley (MS, Financial) has raised its price target for Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) from $150 to $160, citing Nvidia's recent bullish performance and anticipated easing of supply-chain challenges. Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Joseph Moore, forecast that Nvidia's new Blackwell product line will significantly boost revenue in the January quarter, with expected sales in the $5-6 billion range. However, these potential gains may face some offset due to ongoing supply constraints, which could affect current quarter guidance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. Additionally, Nvidia's product demand trends reveal a shift from the H100 to increased demand for the H200, aligning with Nvidia's recent pattern of raising its sales guidance by approximately $2 billion. Analysts estimate Nvidia's January quarter revenue guidance could surpass consensus at $36.5 billion. Morgan Stanley also predicts an increase in Nvidia's gross margins through FY2026, though initial Blackwell ramp-up margins are expected to be lower. Nvidia's previous gross margin guidance dropped from 75.7% in July to 75.0% in October, a conservative estimate according to Morgan Stanley. Consequently, the firm has raised its FY26 revenue and EPS estimates for Nvidia to $176.78 billion and $4.03, with 73.8% non-GAAP gross margins. While Morgan Stanley considers this earnings period transitional, it maintains Nvidia as a top buy with an Overweight rating, driven by Blackwell's projected impact on late 2025 growth.

Election 2024 coverage presented by Bitcoin (BTC) hit $85,000 Monday, data from graphing platform TradingView shows, as it extended its rally following Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continues to hit all-time highs, which shows a strong uptrend. In the past week alone, bitcoin has added almost $20,000 from its Nov. 6 low of $66,700. It was trading recently at $84,255, having climbed as high as $84,989, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, has climbed 29% since the election. The interesting part is that the so-called magnificent seven tech stocks are underperforming. Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and META (META) are all down on the day, while Google (GOOGL) is slightly up. Tesla, holding 9,720 BTC, has added 9.6%. Gold is down almost 3%. This could be a rotation from tech stocks and gold into cryptocurrencies as the market awaits Trump's entry into the White House early next year. His campaign emphasized his support for cryptocurrencies. In addition, according to Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) saw $1 billion in volume in the first 35 minutes of trading. "Day after election it did that in 20minutes, so a bit less than last Wednesday but still pretty intense. Pretty good early indicator of strong inflows this week", according to Balchunas.

Title: Kiwi retail crime intelligence firm Auror raises $82 million from Taser maker, grocery giants

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Auror, an Auckland-based maker of crime reporting and prevention software, has raised $82 million in a Series C venture capital (VC) round – one of the largest for a Kiwi firm - at a valuation north of $500m. If, say, a group of three people shoplift items from a supermarket then run out the door, the store can use Auror templates to quickly file a report with head office and police, including the likes of a snippet of CCTV footage, stills from facial or number plate recognition systems, and witness statements. Auror co-founder and CEO Phil Thomson says it can save a retailer like Woolworths or Z Energy one to two hours in filing time, and police one to seven hours per incident. A study by Sense Partners found in the 12 months to June 2023, police realised $92m and 170,000 hours of savings through workforce efficiency gains by investigating crime and requesting information more efficiently via Auror – a sum that, on paper at least, would fund another 450 police officers. Where’s the prevention element if our supermarket offenders simply legged it? “A lot of retail crime is very well-organised,” Thomson says. Around 10% of offenders are responsible for 60% of losses. Auror’s information helps retailers and police establish who the offenders are, and their patterns of offending – important as many gangs aim to execute multiple heists in a day, whether that’s dramatic ram raids or quieter shoplifting. “Proceeds go to guns, drugs and gangs,” he says. The funds will bankroll a further push into the US, co-founder and chief executive Phil Thomson says. More artificial intelligence tools will also be added, though Thomson. “We focus on responsible AI. It can make a workflow 10 times faster, but we want to keep a human in the loop.” An Auror AI might be able to make connections between crimes that elude an investigator sifting through millions of lines of spreadsheet entries, he says. The raise was led by two new investors, Axon Enterprise (formerly Taser International) and W23, plus returning Sydney VC fund Reinventure, which includes Westpac as its largest limited partner. Nasdaq-listed Axon – which has a US$46 billion ($77b) market cap – invented the Taser in the 1970s. In the 2000s it expanded into bodycams, then computer-aided dispatch software and a cloud-based digital evidence platform. The firm was already an Auror technology partner. W23 is a venture fund backed by five grocery retailers: Tesco (UK, Ireland, Europe), Woolworths Group (Australia and New Zealand), Shoprite Group (Africa), Sobeys (Canada) and Ahold Delhaize (US, Europe and Indonesia). Auror already has a substantial beachhead in North America. “Walmart in the US is one of our flagship customers,” Thomson says. (All up, his firm works with some 45,000 retail stores worldwide.) Yet the US has a much more complicated landscape on the law enforcement side. Auror has a close relationship with law enforcement in New Zealand – smoothed by the fact we have a single police force. The US, by contrast, has some 18,000 agencies going down to the county level, Thomson says. READ MORE: Newly minted unicorn: Jamie Beaton’s Crimson raises $68m at $1 billion valuation That’s where Axon could have a key role in opening doors. “They sell Tasers or bodycams to almost every police force in the US – and the UK and elsewhere.” Another aspect of the US market is “most of those police forces will have different systems that don’t talk to each other”, Thomson says. “If you’re a criminal, you’re going across different county lines and state lines, and so historically, that hasn’t been actually connected together.” He sees that as an opportunity. Thomson is mum on financials but says its revenue, of which 85% is earned offshore, grew by 150% between 2022 and 2024. He says the firm got profitable before its $30m Series B raise in 2021, led by local VC firm Movac. Other investors include Shasta Ventures, Global From Day One, the Crown-backed NZ Growth Capital Partners (NZGCP) via its Aspire fund and Sir Stephen Tindall’s ubiquitous K1W1. “We still have really high conviction in the company but given our funding model – that is, our investments and operating costs are paid entirely out of Aspire realisations – we decided to take the opportunity to take some money off the table during this round,” NZGCP chief investment officer James Pinner told the Herald. The tough venture capital market and economic slowdown notwithstanding, NZGCP is on something of a roll. It recently realised a $37m profit from its early investment in education software maker Kami. Pinner won’t give a dollar figure for Auror, but says “Auror has already delivered back to us well over 10 times the total capital we invested since 2014.” “Part of this round was about making room for those new investors and allowing some of those early shareholders to take some off the table,” Thomson says. “NZGCP’s first investment was back in 2014 and it’s been a really good return for them. They’re not taking out all of their stake. But it’s a mark of success that we’ve been able to generate that return for them, that they could get and invested back into new Kiwi companies.” “We also worked with our team to sell down some of the Esop [employee stock ownership programme], realising some of that financial security.” In July, Australia’s Office of the Australian Information Commissioner started making ‘preliminary inquiries’ after Australian Federal Police said they had started using Auror’s platform without conducting a proper privacy review first. Auror says the OAIC dropped its probe last month. Thomson stresses his firm doesn’t operate any cameras. “We make reporting software,” he says. He pitches that privacy is part of the firm’s DNA. He didn’t work in software, retail or law enforcement before co-founding Auror in 2012. Rather, he worked as an associate at law firm Simpson Grierson, specialising in intellectual property and privacy. He argues a “secure, online evidence locker” used with Auror better protects privacy than the mix of written reports, documents and USB sticks used previously. And while automated number plate recognition has raised concerns about privacy abuse (notably when police used it to illegally track two suspects during Covid lockdowns), Thomson says when it’s paired with Auror’s platform, it has a positive social benefit. He says Auror customer Z Energy reduced its losses from drive-aways by 73% after introducing number plate recognition. Attendants no longer had to make a value judgment based on their perception of how a customer looked. The licence plate detection made it black and white. If a vehicle was a previous drive-away, they did not get pre-pay. “It removes bias.” Thomson adds that 20% of retail crime involves aggression or violence – which he says Auror can help to tamp down. “If you imagine who’s in those stores, it might be a 16-year-old on the checkout doing their first fulltime job or a 60-year-old who’s been doing it for 30 or 40 years. They’re the ones on the front line being impacted by this emotionally and physically.” The firm has 220 staff worldwide, including 80 hired over the past 12 months, Thomson says. Some 150 are based in Auckland, where research and development work takes place. Around 40 are in an office in Denver. The firm has also opened an office in London. While ambitions are global, the core R&D team - established in Morningside in 2012 - will stay local, Thomson says. “We’ve chosen to keep our R&D here. We believe in the New Zealand ecosystem,” Thomson says. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Tesla’s Meme Stock Soars To $1 Trillion Market Cap After Trump’s Win

Good morning! It’s Monday, November 11, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. Here are the important stories you need to know. Tesla’s market cap has surpassed $1 trillion following former President Donald Trump’s election victory on November 5. It rallied 29 percent following Tuesday’s result. That should put the “Is Tesla a meme stock” debate to rest once and for all, even if CEO Elon Musk is slated to play a huge part in Trump’s second administration. Following November 5's close, Tesla had a market cap of $807.1 billion. At the time of writing this story, that number is now $1.01 trillion. Before last week’s massive rally, shares of the carmaker were up about 1 percent on the year. That number is now 30 percent year to date. From CNBC: Tesla rejoins a growing club of tech names that are now worth more than $1 trillion, including Nvidia , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon and Meta (though all but Meta are worth more than $2 trillion). Tesla’s market cap first crossed the $1 trillion mark in October 2021. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has said that a potential Trump administration could spell less regulation for Tesla and other companies. “Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the U.S. market over the coming years,” Ives wrote in a note to clients this week. Trump has said previously he may cut the federal $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Those credits have helped to drive sales of Tesla vehicles historically. Tesla posted revenue of $25.18 billion and a net income of $2.17 billion in the third quarter of 2024. During the earnings call, Musk said his “best guess” was that “vehicle growth” would hit 20 or 30 percent in 2025. He pointed to “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy” as driving forces behind his prediction. I guess we’ll see. Tesla has been promising, and developing, driverless vehicle technology for more than a decade. Its key U.S. competitor, Alphabet-owned Waymo, has pulled ahead and is already operating commercial robotaxi services in several major cities. On the third-quarter call, Musk said he would use his sway with a Trump-Vance administration to establish a “federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.” Currently, approvals happen at the state level, which the CEO sees as a regulatory hurdle Tesla will need to overcome once it finally offers more than partially automated driving systems. Whatever, man. They won. This shit sucks. Let them realize Elon is just making shit up on their own. Both electric vehicle startups Lucid and Rivian make some really good cars, but they’ve got a little bit of a cash burn problem. Both lost money on every car they delivered in the third quarter, which isn’t great. Rivian reported a $1.1 billion net loss in Q3 on $874 million in revenue after sales fell. Lucid’s sales actually improved in the quarter, but its net loss widened to $950 million on $200 million in revenue. From Automotive News: The EV makers are expected to burn through billions of dollars as they develop more affordable midsize crossovers for 2026 that will lower the entry price into the brands from around $70,000 with shipping for current models to around $50,000 for the crossovers that are still about two years from production. Analysts say Rivian and Lucid need to rein in costs if they are ever to become profitable. In addition, they warn that the reelection of former President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 could bring reduced support for electric-vehicle incentives that go to the automakers and to the consumers who buy their products. “We anticipate that the transition to electric vehicles in the U.S. will be hindered under Trump’s administration,” GlobalData said in a Nov. 6 research note. Trump’s regulatory changes “could lead to a 15-20 percent decrease in the market share of battery electric vehicles in the U.S. by 2030 compared to our base forecast.” Bank of America downgraded Rivian stock to a neutral rating from buy after the third-quarter earnings report, citing the potential loss of regulatory credits from EV sales under a Trump administration. EV makers can sell those credits to industry counterparts who don’t meet emissions standards. “We are making real meaningful progress in terms of lowering our bill of materials, lowering our cost structure,” said Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe on the third-quarter earnings call Nov. 7. “In a similar fashion, we’re also driving efficiency into how we’re running the plant. So the hours per unit that we build is coming down.” In a bit of good news, Rivian expects to achieve a gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year. That’ll partially come through the sale of regulatory credits for about $275 million, according to the company, but hey, every little bit helps. In the third quarter, Rivian’s gross loss per vehicle delivered rose to $39,130 compared with $30,648 in the year-earlier period, it said. Those numbers will improve in the fourth quarter as a result of Rivian’s cost-cutting programs for its R1T pickup and R1S crossover, Scaringe said on the earnings call. Rivian said it had cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion at the end of the quarter. It also has a $5 billion investment from Volkswagen Group as part of a joint venture that is expected to close before the end of the year, Scaringe said. Third-quarter deliveries for the Irvine, Calif., automaker fell 36 percent to 10,018 vehicles, and output dropped 19 percent to 13,157, the company said. Rivian is suffering from a parts shortage that started in the third quarter that has limited electric-motor production, it said. Lucid has its own world of issues to deal with as well. Lucid reported a 91 percent increase in third-quarter sales to a record 2,781 for its sole model, the Air sedan. The Newark, Calif., automaker’s production increased 16 percent to 1,805 vehicles. Similar to Rivian, Lucid is focused on cost cutting to improve its finances after raising $4 billion this year to support its loss-making operations. Those include the start of production of its first crossover, the Gravity, this year and the development of the midsize model that is scheduled for production in late 2026. Lucid vastly expanded its Casa Grande, Ariz., factory this year for production of the Gravity and brought more of its manufacturing in-house to reduce costs, CEO Peter Rawlinson said on the Nov. 7 conference call. [...] In its third-quarter earnings report, Lucid said cash and cash equivalents stood at $1.89 billion, compared with $1.35 billion in the preceding three-month period. In October, Lucid announced it was raising $1.75 billion more through a public offering and a private placement of shares. Luckily for both nascent automakers, they both say they’ve got enough financing to fund projects into 2026. That’s a really good thing, because Lucid and Rivian make some of the most compelling products on the market right now. Jaguar is set to unveil a new concept vehicle in Miami on December 2 that’ll give a glimpse of the first new model under JLR’s strategy to reposition the British brand as a luxury EV maker. It’s going to be shown the night before Miami’s Art Week kicks off. JLR says the first model to be launched on its new JEA Jaguar-specific electric platform will be a “four-door GT,” so I suppose we should look out of some sort of fast sedan. That’s good news, because Jaguar is very good at fast, good-looking sedans. The automaker also said it will be a “copy of nothing.” From Automotive News: Jaguar will now launch the model in late summer 2026, CEO Adrian Mardell said on an earnings call on Nov. 8. Last year JLR said the Jaguar EV would be launched in 2025. Mardell told journalists that the company was being cautious on timing as it monitored demand for electric cars. “BEV adoption is looking a little bit weaker and more inconsistent than would have been 12 months ago,” he said. The U.S. and the U.K. will be key markets for the car, Mardell added. The U.K. is one of the best-performing global EV markets, with a share growing to 18 percent in the 10 months to the end of October. Demand for electric cars in the U.S. has been thrown into uncertainty with the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Trump has promised to roll back some EV incentive programs, although he counts Tesla CEO Elon Musk as an important ally. JLR is monitoring the uptake of EVs as it plans the timing of the second and possible third models on the JEA platform as well as those cars on the company’s new Electrified Modular Architecture, or EMA, platform for smaller Range Rover models. Whatever Jaguar is going to do in the future, it better be damn good. It’s one of those brands I’ve always loved, and it’s a goddamn shame to see it in the shape its in today. The gas-powered Cadillac XT4 has an official expiration date as GM says the compact crossover will end production in January of 2025 at the company’s Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas. It coincides with the end of the Chevy Malibu’s production at the same plant. Don’t fret, Fairfax enthusiasts. GM is investing $391 million at the plant to make the new version of the Chevy Bolt in late 2025. From the Detroit News: “General Motors is confident in our strong ICE and EV portfolio and will lean into growth opportunities guided by customer demand,” GM spokesperson Kevin Kelly said in a statement. “There is no change to our previously announced $391 million investment and staffing plans at Fairfax Assembly. This facility will continue to play a critical role in GM’s future with the new Chevrolet Bolt EV. “ GM plans to bring a shift back to Fairfax in October 2025 ahead of the start of Bolt production, according to a plant memo sent to employees that was obtained by The Detroit News. The automaker is anticipating a return of the second production shift in the first quarter of 2026, according to that memo. GM will be temporarily laying off 686 United Auto Workers-represented employees when Malibu production ends and about 759 more in January when the XT4 ends, according to the memo. GM originally planned to end XT4 production in January and then resume it in mid-2025 but pulled back on those plans. Cadillac has three more EVs coming: the Escalade IQ, the Optiq SUV and the Vistiq three-row SUV. It already has Cadillac Lyriq SUV and the hand-built Celestiq, an ultra-luxury car. “Cadillac will offer our most comprehensive portfolio ever in 2025 with twelve models and a mix of ICE and EVs,” Kelly said. “The current lineup meets the need of almost every luxury customer with an offering in most major segments. In just over a year, Cadillac has introduced six new products which will help us maintain our momentum.” XT4 production started in the fall of 2018 for the 2019 model year. Through Q3 of 2024, Cadillac sold 15,688 of the little crossovers. That’s down 12 percent from last year. So long, little guy. At the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, World War I ends. At 5 a.m. that…

Shares of the Detroit automaker have risen 54.7% ahead of Monday's opening, outperforming legacy competitors, Tesla, and U.S. electric vehicle startups Lucid Group and Rivian Automotive. "You may still not believe it, but it's true, GM keeps on trucking," BofA Securities analysts John Murphy wrote in an investor note in October after the automaker beat Wall Street's third-quarter expectations. GM has done so with the assistance of $12.4 billion in stock buybacks since last November, which the automaker said will continue for the foreseeable future. But it's also proving itself to be operationally better than its crosstown rivals Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis, as well as other sector peers. CEO and Chair Mary Barra has touted that kind of differentiation for years, but it has largely fallen upon deaf ears. For the most part, GM stock has traded in lockstep with Ford due to their histories and the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. But not this year. Ford stock is off 10% as of Friday's close. Others, including Ferrari, which has been among Wall Street's top auto performers, are also trailing GM. Even with shares of Tesla surging more than 30% during the past week following President-elect Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election, the electric vehicle maker continues to trail GM. Tesla CEO Elon Musk heavily campaigned for Trump. GM, unlike many competitors, has not lowered its 2024 guidance or underperformed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations. Instead, it's actually raised key financial targets despite facing ongoing market challenges in the U.S. and its Chinese operations losing hundreds of millions of dollars amid increased competition. While GM has said it's cutting costs, it has not had to be as aggressive as other automakers this year. Nissan, Volkswagen and Stellantis are conducting massive business restructurings that include layoffs, production cuts and other cost-saving measures. Shares of GM under Barra, who started leading the automaker in January 2014, have been lackluster for investors for most of her tenure. The stock's average closing price under her tenure is $38 per share — lower than the $40.02 per share closing price before she became CEO, according to FactSet data. Cumulative, as of Friday's close, shares are up 38.9% under Barra's tenure. That compares with a nearly 300% increase for the S&P 500 during that time frame. GM's all-time high stock price under Barra was $67.21 on Jan. 5, 2022, as Barra presented GM's EV ambitions and growth plans. Whether GM can continue its hot streak going into next year is yet to be seen, but the automaker has advised it expects the 2025 performance of the company to be in line with this year, including signaling a weaker fourth quarter. Barra, when discussing quarterly earnings Oct. 22, reiterated her stance that GM will continue to "build on our competitive strength and deliver the performance that differentiates us from others in the industry." "We're going to be disciplined and we'll be resilient, and we'll make adjustments to the extent that we can to continue to drive growth and profitability," Barra said. "In the weeks and months ahead, you'll see more clearly than ever how we intend to leverage the tailwinds that are within our control to deliver strong results in 2025 that are in a similar range to 2024." GM stock on average is weighted overweight with a price target of $59.85 per share, according to average Wall Street estimates compiled by FactSet. Got a confidential news tip?

Shares of the Detroit automaker have risen 54.7% ahead of Monday's opening, outperforming legacy competitors, Tesla, and U.S. electric vehicle startups Lucid Group and Rivian Automotive. "You may still not believe it, but it's true, GM keeps on trucking," BofA Securities analysts John Murphy wrote in an investor note in October after the automaker beat Wall Street's third-quarter expectations. GM has done so with the assistance of $12.4 billion in stock buybacks since last November, which the automaker said will continue for the foreseeable future. But it's also proving itself to be operationally better than its crosstown rivals Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis, as well as other sector peers.

Title: TSMC can't send advanced AI chips to China anymore, U.S. says

The U.S. has reportedly ordered the world’s largest chipmaker not to send its advanced artificial intelligence chips to China anymore. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.88%) was told to stop shipping advanced AI chips to Chinese customers starting Monday, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The Department of Commerce told the Taiwanese chipmaker in a letter that it is imposing export restrictions on advanced chips made with the 7-nanometer process or smaller, the person said. Meanwhile, TSMC reportedly told its Chinese customers it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7-nanometer process or beyond starting Monday, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. If TSMC does produce the advanced chips for Chinese firms in the future, the U.S. government would likely be involved in an approval process, the people said. They told the Financial Times they are unsure if the rules will affect other chips that China’s leading chip firms are designing. The rules will reportedly have a minimal impact on TSMC’s revenue. TSMC said it is a “law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls,” in a statement previously shared with Quartz. It declined to comment further. The chipmaker reportedly made the decision to cut off Chinese firms to improve internal controls and in anticipation of updated U.S. export controls on chips sold to China by the outgoing Biden administration. TSMC is also reportedly worried about being targeted by the incoming Trump administration, which has accused Taiwan of stealing chip manufacturing from the U.S. TSMC’s new rules come as the chipmaker faces an investigation into how its advanced chip technology ended up in a cutting-edge AI accelerator from sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei. Canadian research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s chip and reportedly found the TSMC-made tech. The Taiwan-based company is also facing rules at home that restrict it from producing 2-nanometer chips abroad, the Taipei Times reported. J.W. Kuo, Taiwan’s minister of economic affairs, said that although the company will eventually produce the advanced chips abroad, “its core technology will stay” on the island. “Since Taiwan has related regulations to protect its own technologies, TSMC cannot produce 2-nanometer chips overseas currently,” Kuo said during a meeting with Taiwan’s Economics Committee, according to the Taipei Times.

Title: Why Did AXON Stock Rise 30%?

LISBON, PORTUGAL - NOVEMBER 28: A Maritime Police Commando carries a Taser 7 gun during a ceremony ... [+] to deliver them attended by State Secretary for National Defense Carlos Lopes Pires, the Portuguese Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Henrique Gouveia e Melo, and the Director General of the Maritime Authority and Commander General of the Maritime Police Vice Admiral João Dores Aresta at the House of Scales, Central Navy facilities, on November 28, 2023, in Lisbon, Portugal. (Photo by Horacio Villalobos#Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images) Axon Enterprise stock (NASDAQ: AXON), best known for its products, including taser and body cams for the law enforcement agencies, surged nearly 30% on Friday, November 8, after the company posted a solid Q3 beat and raised its outlook. Axon reported revenue of $544 million and earnings of $1.45 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $527 million and $1.20 respectively. The company is benefiting from increased adoption for its products, amid continued innovation. Separately, after a big rise, see Buy, Sell, Or Hold Insulet (PODD) Stock? For example, Axon's Draft One uses generative AI to convert the audio from the body cam into a report narrative draft. Also, it can translate over 100 languages. Such offerings help improve the efficiency of the police force. Axon's Taser sales surged 36% y-o-y to $221.7 million in Q3, its Cloud & Services sales were also up 36%, while Sensors & Other revenue was up 18%. The company-wide sales were up 32%, driven by continued demand for Taser and body cams. Not only did Axon see strong sales growth, its adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 400 bps y-o-y to 26.7% in Q3. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in a bottom line of $1.45, versus 1.05 in the prior-year quarter. This year has been spectacular for AXON stock, with returns of 133%, compared to 25% gains for the broader S&P500 index. Admirably, AXON stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last three years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, 6% in 2022, and 56% in 2023. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and changes from the new Trump presidency, could AXON see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think AXON is fully valued at levels of around $600. At its current levels, AXON stock is trading at 25x trailing revenues, versus the stock's average P/S ratio of 12x over the last five years. Now, some rise in the valuation multiple seems justified, given the strong sales and earnings growth. An increased adoption of its products bodes well for the stock in the long run, given that the company earns recurring revenues from sales of cartridges and services for its products. Then there is the Trump factor. Law enforcement agencies are expected to be well funded under the Trump administration. There is a possibility of increased spending on technologies and products to improve security. Axon recently acquired Dedrone to expand its security offerings, and it is expected to see an increased adoption going forward. That said, Axon's valuation multiple has now risen 2x compared to its historical average, making the stock look expensive, in our view. While AXON stock looks fully valued, it is helpful to see other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons. Separately, look at what's happening with Delta stock.

Title: Trump won't be as positive for stocks as people think, but AI will keep the market soaring, research firm says

Donald Trump's policies could disappoint the stock market, but that won't stop another key catalyst from helping the S&P 500 soar to new highs, Capital Economics said. While investors seem convinced that Trump offers the best outcome for stocks, the research firm pushed back on this idea. Bullish momentum should still drive indexes sky-high next year, but that will only reflect ceaseless enthusiasm for artificial intelligence rather than a boost from new policies. By the firm's estimates, the S&P will surge to around 7,000 by the end of next year, indicating about 15% upside from current levels. "However, this has nothing to do with the policies we expect will be delivered," Capital Economics said. "In fact, we think these will be negative for equities, as Trump's second term proves to be neither 'pro-growth' nor 'pro-business.'" While the market's post-election reaction was euphoric, Capital Economics suggested that investors look more closely at Trump's plans, their likelihood of becoming reality, and the potential impact on the economy. On the one hand, Trump may be unable to deliver on promised tax cuts even with a Republican Congress. "The bottom line is that without a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, Trump would be forced to rely on the convoluted budget reconciliation process. A likely single-digit majority in the House will complicate the process," Capital Economics wrote in a separate note on Friday. Additionally, Republican legislators may fear negative bond market reactions if tax cuts are pursued, as traders have grown increasingly concerned about rising US debt. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped sharply after Trump's victory as the market priced in higher interest rates, higher government spending, and higher inflation under Trump. There's also room to doubt Trump's push for deregulation, a promise that has helped drive financial stocks higher. Capital Economics said that Trump had made the same claims of massive deregulation in 2016, with little long-term impact on the market. Finally, the research firm said it considers Trump's tariff and immigration policy to be net negatives for the economy. Though it remains to be seen if the President-elect will stick to his promise for a 10%-20% universal tariff on all imports to the US, this is enough to weigh on company profit and prospects, the note said. In that case, rather than pinning hopes on policy to drive gains, Capital Economics said that AI should continue to bring fresh upside. "Instead, our bullish forecast for equities rests on our view that AI-enthusiasm will grow further and outweigh any headwind from Trump's policies," the firm wrote. "That said, the S&P 500 reaching 7,000 due to AI-hype would inour view mean that a bubble has formed in the US and indeedreached the point where it bursts."

This week’s Future of Work newsletter dives into managing post-election uncertainty, the best employers for veterans and shares, exclusively, news that global hiring platform Oyster has netted a funding round extension. This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday! Signage is pictured at a warehouse on October 29, 2024 in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Hannah Beier/Getty Images) We’re now six days out from last week’s historic election, one that ushered in a new world order of uncertainty, increased tribalism and—depending on your employee base—either elation or dramatically heightened fear. But as we move into our post-election reality—and as questions surrounding what leaders should say about the results give way to questions about what to do next—leading teams with integrity amid chaos will matter more than ever. Helping people find focus in a world full of distractions will be necessary as many employees are left feeling unsettled. And we’ll all need more ways to calm and regulate workplace stress amid growing uncertainty. What will tariffs mean when it comes to job creation? Senior contributor Jack Kelly takes a look at the potential impact if President-elect Donald Trump were to follow through on his threats to implement new tariffs, suggesting there could be an increase in employment opportunities in sectors directly benefiting from tariffs, such as companies scaling up domestic production. At the same time, “small businesses, which often operate with slimmer margins, might struggle more with the increased costs due to tariffs, potentially leading to closures or reduced employment,” Kelly writes. He also examines what a job search amid a presidential election transition could look like. For more on what a Trump presidency might mean on policy issues—like the minimum wage or DEI initiatives—keep reading below. This week, we also have exclusive news on new funding in global hiring platform Oyster, and as it’s Veteran’s Day, we also have our latest ranking on the best employers for veterans. Here’s to a new week. Though written before election results came in, my colleague Maria Gracia Santillana Linares examined why there wasn’t more talk about the minimum wage during the election season. (Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have both supported eliminating taxes on tips, and Trump has said he would end them on overtime pay.) Two big reasons: Change has been focused at the state level for at least the past 15 years, ever since the last time Congress passed a law enshrining a new minimum wage, and those local efforts have vastly narrowed the number of people who still work at or below the federal minimum wage to just 1.1% of U.S. workers in 2023. What will Trump’s election mean for diversity, equity and inclusion programs? HR Dive writes that an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Trump will likely take a “more narrow view of what’s permissible under DEI initiatives,” quoting Jim Paretti, former senior counsel at the acting chair of the EEOC. “I think DEI in a Republican administration is going to be under a lot more scrutiny, a lot more limitations, by way of the government power of the purse,” Paretti said. The same morning as Election Day, Boeing’s striking factory workers voted to accept the company’s revised contract offer, which promised a larger wage increase and bonus payments, writes Forbes’ Siladitya Ray. The deal ended a seven-week-long work stoppage, setting the stage for the crisis-ridden company to restart production lines. Forbes recently published its fifth annual ranking of America’s Best Employers For Veterans, which is based on survey responses from more than 24,000 veterans (those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces, the Reserves or the National Guard) working for companies with more than 1,000 employees in the United States. Respondents were asked if they would recommend their company or institution to friends and family, and to rate their employer on several criteria. This year’s No. 1? Salesforce. Read on here to learn more about the rest. Oyster CEO and cofounder Tony James On Monday, global hiring platform Oyster, Forbes can report exclusively, will announce a $5 million extension to its recent $59 million Series D funding round, which valued the company at $1.2 billion. The most recent investment, from ServiceNow Ventures, brings the company’s total funding to $291 million as it aims to compete with even bigger rivals, such as Deel, which is seen as a possible IPO candidate. Just before the new announcement, Forbes spoke with cofounder and CEO Tony Jamous who, appropriately enough for a company that helps employers hire people globally, is based in Paphos, Cyprus. Excerpts below from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity. There’s a lot of players in this space, and one—Deel—that’s particularly big. How do you distinguish yourself? We saw the team members on our platform in emerging economies grow from less than 30% to more than 40% in two years. That’s what we call our impact ratio. Our rivals are going horizontal—launching HRIS platforms, they have engagement management platforms, domestic payroll. We are only interested in helping domestic companies hire in other countries. We’re focused on making global hiring as easy as local hiring. We want to make the planet Earth look like one job market. We are here for a purpose. We’re here to make the world more free and equal, democratizing access to global job opportunities. … I’d love for Deel to be extremely successful with their [potential] IPO. Please, God, help them—because it’s going to open the market for everybody. Following Amazon’s announcement about requiring five days in office, are you seeing any impact from companies wanting to hire fewer people in remote locales? We see that from big companies. They make the news. We don’t see that in our customer base. It’s a no-brainer for them to tap into the global talent pool when it comes to cost efficiency, when it comes to diversity and when it comes to accessibility to talent. … We are giving the smaller companies a super power when it comes to their talent strategy. Our growth shows that. … We grew revenues 60% last year. You recently had a big funding round. Tell me how you’re putting that to work. We’ve launched Global Payroll to help customers employ in their existing overseas entities. Importantly, we’re not competing with domestic payroll. Just cross-border. We’re also excited about growing through M&A. Our organic activity remains our top priority, but we want to remain acquisitive and opportunistic in our ability to accelerate. Third [would be] about reaching profitability. This business is an economy of scale business. How difficult was it to raise funding in this environment? The whole technology sector’s been in a [state of] constant fear. Chronic fear. Nobody knew where the valuations were headed, where the market expectations were headed. I started fundraising since the market shifted. Day one. Building relationships with investors early on, telling the story of Oyster. We shifted our focus into operational efficiency very rapidly. What are you seeing from your customers about their interest in hiring? Much, much [fewer] layoffs are happening. That was a trend that started a couple of months ago we hope will continue. The genie is out of the box. Globalization of the workforce is going to happen the same way globalization of commerce happened. The key is not to generate fear for the person in Chicago. It’s an opportunity for the person in the Philippines to ask for increasing pay and improve their life conditions. But the person in Chicago is still out of a job, no? There’s a downside for them. There are 80 million jobs going unfilled in the West. There’s a job shortage. … There is a massive need for knowledge workers to work for companies in the West that cannot be filled with the amount of workers that are available. It’s open enrollment season for benefits. A new survey from Corebridge Financial looks at how employers can best support their workers—at a time when choices are more important than ever for workers to get right. 18%: The percentage of workers who find the process of open enrollment confusing and complex 68%: The percentage of both Gen Z and Millennial workers who want their employers to provide one-on-one support for enrolling in new benefits “Personalization is key.

Title: Sam Altman Has a Side Project Called ‘World’ Aimed at Tackling a World Ruled by A.I.

The past two years have been action-packed for Sam Altman, the co-founder and CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. But that hasn’t stopped the A.I. executive from continuing to work on his many side projects, which include Worldcoin, an obscure venture dedicated to human identification. Worldcoin’s primary product is a digital passport storing individual biometric data known as World ID. Last month, Altman announced a slew of updates that will see improvements to various features supporting the venture’s “proof of personhood” mission. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Worldcoin was founded in 2019 and publicly launched last year as a project from Tools for Humanity, a startup established by Altman and Alex Blania, a former deep learning researcher at Caltech. The company’s initial mission was to use digital identification to distribute its own crypto token, WLD, to all humans as a form of a universal basic income, a concept Altman has been interested in for years. In a future where A.I. is ubiquitous, Worldcoin wants to develop tools that will help distinguish humans from bots.”We started thinking about the infrastructure that society was going to need if A.I. really started to happen,” Altman said during a Worldcoin event last month. To that end, Altman and Blania announced at the event that Worldcoin will be rebranded to “World” going forward because the new name better encapsulates the project’s new mission “to accelerate every human.” In order to verify human identities, World uses a product known as ‘the Orb.’ The circular biometric devices scan human eyes to collect unique iris data that becomes part of one’s World ID. The venture chose iris fragments instead of the more traditional fingerprints or face data route because iris biometrics contain more unique details and are less susceptible to external change, it claims. World recently unveiled its next-generation Orb, which is powered by Nvidia (NVDA)’s Jetson chipset and boasts an A.I. performance that is nearly five times better than the previous version. It is also improving accessibility to Orbs, which will be available at flagship locations, self-serve kiosks and can be ordered by individuals through an on-demand service. Updates were additionally announced to World ID, which will now offer enhanced privacy features and the new feature known as Deep Face that will help users identify A.I. deepfakes on video calls like FaceTime, WhatsApp and Zoom. Meanwhile, a new version of the project’s World App—which stores the World ID—will now feature a platform allowing third party apps to run inside the platform. According to Altman and Blania, World is halfway through its four-step roadmap. Having accomplished the development of the Orb and a blockchain network, it is currently working on scaling and will eventually tackle the fourth stage of redistributing the benefits of A.I. “We want to see what happens when we do this at mass scale,” said Altman. While the venture has for years maintained its goal of reaching one billion users by 2023, it currently only has 15 million World ID holders. “It’s great that we’ve signed up so many people, but there’s 99.9 percent left to go,” said the OpenAI CEO.

Title: Elon Musk’s Trump bet has paid off so well that Tesla is now worth more than most of the rest of the car industry combined
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/
Time Published: 2024-11-11T12:50:57Z
Full Content:
Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s ‘all-in’ gamble to get Donald Trump elected president has proven so successful that a veritable chasm has opened up between his EV manufacturer and the rest of the auto industry. As conventional carmakers trade at rock-bottom prices amid a broad industry malaise brought on by China’s economic slowdown and growing fears of Trump tariffs, Tesla’s stock continues to soar, creating one of the biggest valuation gaps it’s ever seen. On Friday, Tesla reclaimed its place in the elite club of companies worth more than $1 trillion after adding a full third in market capitalization since Election Day less than a week ago. The last time Tesla was worth this amount of money it was April 2022, Musk had just revealed his $44 billion plan to acquire Twitter. Relative to its peers, Tesla is now worth more than the next 15 largest carmakers combined—from Toyota and General Motors all the way down to Jeep’s parent company Stellantis and Hyundai. Toss in lower ranked names like Kia and Renault, respectively worth $26.6 billion and $12.6 billion, and Tesla is still is still ahead, only drawing even once the $8.8 billion from Japan’s Nissan is thrown into the mix. Pretty soon more names can be added to the list, as Tesla is indicated to open nearly 7% higher on Monday, raising its market cap to approximately $1.1 trillion. Last week’s gains also reflect market optimism that Trump will deliver on his planned cut to the corporate tax rate from 21% down to 15% for U.S. manufacturers like Tesla. Musk might even get his wish for federal legislation enabling autonomous vehicles, replacing the confusing patchwork quilt of state laws. This could accelerate Tesla’s plans to roll out unsupervised full-self driving. And while some economists fear Trump’s love for tariffs could hurt business with GM’s Chevrolet Equinox and Ford Mustang Mach-E—both EVs competing with Tesla—imported from Mexico, that is not likely to slow Tesla down. Musk manufactures all Tesla models sold in the U.S. either at its California plant in Fremont or in Austin (its battery cells, a major input by value, are however still predominantly imported from Asia). David Sacks, like Musk a member of the PayPal mafia who supported Trump, had a simpler explanation for why the stock soared after the election. Musk's influence in Trump’s second administration would defang regulatory enforcement by agencies like the traffic safety authority NHTSA and put a swift end to investigations into Musk’s business dealings. “That was the lawfare discount — the stock market pricing in the viciousness of Democrats,” Sacks posted on Friday. Tesla's stock premium compared to its peers is also cavernous. At present, Yahoo Finance lists Tesla’s likely 2025 earnings per share at $3.24, according to the consensus estimate of 34 analysts polled. That means investors are paying 100 times earnings for each share, versus 5.3 times for a General Motors. Generally a 100 earnings multiple is the point at which even tech stocks tends to lose the tether to their underlying fundamentals. Take Nvidia, for example: the stock that drove S&P 500 gains this year — it trades at 36.1 times next year’s forecast earnings. Other megacap trillion dollar companies like Amazon (33.9x) Microsoft (28.3x), Apple (27.3x), Meta (23.3x) and Alphabet (19.9x) currently are valued at multiples that are even lower. That could suggest that Tesla’s earnings estimates are lagging behind the market and have yet to catch up with investor sentiment. But 34 analysts just recently revised them upwards over the past 30 days, mainly to reflect Musk’s bullish October prediction that Tesla car sales are set to jump by 20% to 30% next year on the back of new models including lower priced versions of the Cybertruck. As a result, Future Fund money manager Gary Black warned the spread between Tesla’s sentiment-driven share price and the average Wall Street price target based on the fundamental business metrics has reached its highest level since October 2021—a month before the stock hit its all-time peak. “Absent earnings increases, analysts can’t just raise Tesla price targets without economic justification,” he argued on Monday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: US to TSMC: Halt AI chip shipments to China

Time Published: 2024-11-11T11:18:03Z

Good morning. Our spectacular Fortune Global Forum is finally upon us. There’s a great deal of tech on the program. Today’s sessions include talks about China, AI, entertainment, and workplace transformation with leaders from the biggest organizations on the planet. (And interviewers that include yours truly.) Unable to join IRL? That’s OK. Watch a mainstage livestream right here. —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. The United States has told one of the world’s largest chipmakers to quit sending advanced chips to Chinese customers. The Department of Commerce reportedly sent Taiwan’s TSMC a letter imposing export restrictions on certain advanced chip designs—7 nanometers and below—that are used in larger AI chips. Just weeks ago, TSMC notified the U.S. that its chips had somehow made their way into Huawei AI processors—a trade violation because the Shenzhen company is on a restricted trade list. The Biden administration reportedly drafted new rules on some exports of chipmaking equipment to Chinese companies, but they remain unreleased.According to Reuters, TSMC has notified its clients that it would suspend chip shipments starting today. —AN Bangalore’s hottest club? The $1.4 billion initial public offering by Swiggy. The food and grocery delivery company’s IPO is reportedly way oversubscribed thanks to a final rush of institutional investors. Retail investors were also oversubscribed. The offering, which is expected in Mumbai on Wednesday, promises to be India’s second-largest this year behind Hyundai Motor India. Swiggy, which principally competes with rival Zamato, isn’t yet profitable, and that will likely weigh on traders’ minds as the company makes its debut. (A recent investigation by India’s competition commission found both firms to be in violation of antitrust laws given their exclusivity contracts with partners.) In the meantime, the 10-year-old company is already well on its way in assessing new areas for expansion—e.g. ticketed events or personal services like fitness trainers—as it pursues a “superapp” approach. —AN Edtech pioneer Chegg—which offers textbook rental, online tutoring, study tools, and other student-focused services—is on its knees as students look to ChatGPT for help with their homework. Chegg’s share price is down 99%, to about $2, from early 2021, when it peaked at about $113. “Since ChatGPT’s launch,” a Wall Street Journal story reads, “Chegg has lost more than half a million subscribers who pay up to $19.95 a month for prewritten answers to textbook questions and on-demand help from experts.” Today Chegg has its own AI-powered tools, but they haven’t reversed subscriber decline. Wall Street expects the company to record a drop in revenue when it shares its third-quarter earnings tomorrow. Chegg has pivoted several times since its 2006 founding as an Iowa State University message board. (Chegg = chicken + egg. Get it?) It made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange in late 2013. But it’s been a rough ride since the go-go days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Longtime CEO Dan Rosensweig stepped down in June; his successor, Nathan Schultz, promptly laid off more than 400 employees—a quarter of the company’s workforce. —AN Science-fiction fans, this one’s for you. (Privacy fans, maybe stop reading right here.) Visa and China’s Tencent are partnering to launch a new biometric service in Singapore that would require you to place your palm over a reader to authenticate and make payments at retail stores and restaurants. The service will be available to holders of Visa cards issued by Singaporean banks DBS, UOB, and OCBC. Tencent and Visa will first deploy the tech in the wild at Alchemist, a local coffee chain with 10 locations throughout the city-state. Here’s how it works. Completing a one-time enrollment at a merchant’s point of sale allows a Visa payment token to be bound to your palm biometric template. After that, simply wave your mitt to pay anywhere the tech is supported—no card or phone necessary. Why Singapore, you ask? Because its population is primed for tech. Close to seven in 10 people in the island nation believe using your palm is a secure way to pay, according to Visa. —AN In the wake of Apple’s admission that it may never invent something as popular and lucrative as the iPhone comes fresh analysis saying that its future lies in the planets that orbit around its star. (So to speak.) Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says Apple will likely realize future growth from new product categories that reinforce the constellation of services—its App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, and others—that emerged in the wake of its smash-hit smartphone. That will hardly come as a surprise to anyone who’s watched Apple over the last decade and a half. Apple’s iPad (born 2010), Watch (2015), HomePod (2018), and Vision (2024) were all meant to reinforce that ecosystem. Nevermind retroactive changes made to the Mac itself, which well predates Apple’s Golden iGoose. Gurman, a longtime Apple watcher, believes growth can be found in several product categories. A non-“Pro” Apple Vision could pack the company’s ecosystem into something that better resembles daily eyewear. The AirPod family could continue its growth (there are now four models) by integrating more advanced features. And, of course, there’s the living room. A sharper take on the HomePod family—perhaps something with a screen?—would help Apple better compete with devices from Amazon, Google, and Meta. —AN —Amazon is reconfiguring its physical stores to better align shopping, fulfillment needs. —Painting made by AI robot sells for $1.1m. It depicts Alan Turing as a god. —Daniel Lurie wasn’t tech leaders’ first choice for SF mayor, but they expect a good working relationship. —17% of peer reviews in CS pubs are AI-written. Commendable, as a chatbot might say. —A new Apple update forces idle phone reboots that reportedly keeps law enforcement at bay. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Amazon Has Slashed Its US Ad Spend by $700 Million This Year

Time Published: 2024-11-11T11:00:00Z

As Amazon’s revenue and stock price continue to climb, the company is also pulling back. Between January and August, Amazon cut its core retail business’s U.S. ad spend by 20%—equivalent to $700 million—compared to the same time in 2023, according to estimates from marketing intelligence platform MediaRadar. The drop from $3.4 billion to $2.7 billion comes amid other cost-cutting measures across the company under CEO Andy Jassy, who took control of the ecommerce giant after founder Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021. Amazon has shut down brick-and-mortar stores, such as the Go convenience chain and grocery services. It’s also undergone rounds of layoffs. Annual reports reveal the company shrunk from around 1.61 million full- and part-time employees in 2021 to 1.53 million last year. Overall, Amazon’s global investment in advertising and other promotional costs related to its various products and services, from Twitch to Whole Foods to Amazon Web Services, has decreased from $20.6 billion in 2022 to $20.3 billion in 2023, per its annual reports. For MediaRadar’s analysis of retailers’ U.S. ad spend, the firm limited its focus on Amazon to the company’s core retail business. Amazon’s Ad Business Grew Faster Than the Company’s Overall Growth in Q3 These cost reductions appear to be working. Amazon reported $17.4 billion in operating income during its recent third-quarter earnings, up 55% year over year. “We’ve definitely seen Amazon increase their margins over the past couple of quarters,” said Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder and CEO of retail research firm Marketplace Pulse. In total, retailers Amazon, Walmart, Temu, Target, and Shein spent $5.6 billion on advertising between January and August 2024, representing a 11% year-over-year decrease. Amazon, Target, Walmart, Shein, and Temu either declined or did not respond to requests for comment. Ad spending, however, fluctuates by retailer. Temu’s investment in paid media, for example, grew 13%—indicative of the Chinese-based retailer’s continued increase in ad spending. Despite Temu’s high-priced Super Bowl ads the past couple of years, 77% of Temu’s advertising dollars went toward digital this year, according to MediaRadar. Kaziukėnas said Temu’s heavy reliance on digital ads—usually ads that promote specific products—shows how the retailer hasn’t become a mainstream name for U.S. consumers. “Relative to other retailers, Temu has a high ratio of sales coming from advertising,” he said. “It has very little stickiness and perpetually has to spend on advertising to remind people that it exists.” Meanwhile, China-based Shein’s ad spend dropped by 49% year-over-year—though from a significantly smaller base than Temu. Unlike Temu, Shein doesn’t need to spend on advertising to acquire customers because it’s more well-known and drives organic sales from social media and other channels, Kaziukėnas said. “They can afford to spend less on marketing to get the sales they need,” he said. Elsewhere, Target’s ad spend dropped 9%, while Walmart’s increased 9% during the same period. Lauren Johnson is Adweek's deputy editor of retail media and commerce.

Title: What needs to go right for Intel, and what happens if it doesn't
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/intel-dow-jones-ai-chip-lag-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-11T10:00:02Z

US policymakers are still betting that Intel is the nation's best shot at manufacturing chips. It's a long shot. The S&P Dow Jones Indices said on November 1 that Intel is losing its 25-year spot to Nvidia in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Intel's stock has dropped nearly 50% so far this year, and the company has faced billions in losses. It's also had sweeping layoffs, buyouts, and other setbacks. The many moving parts of Intel's strategy could still help it recover from its recent setbacks if they're executed well. Business Insider spoke with industry analysts to ask what should go right for Intel to get back on track. Intel has specifically lagged in the age of generative AI compared to competitors like Nvidia, Qualcomm, and AMD, which have their chips produced by Taiwan-based chip giant TSMC. BI's Alistair Barr previously wrote that since Intel is the only company manufacturing high-powered chips on American soil at scale, rather than outsourcing the job to Taiwan, the company is a key part of the bedrock of the country's technology ecosystem. "Chips power the modern economy," he wrote. "If you have to get these components overseas, you're vulnerable." Given lawmakers' keen geopolitical and economic interests in maintaining the US's technological advantage, that means weighing all possible outcomes for Intel's future as the company struggles to gain its footing in the AI race. "What's going on in Intel is not good, and being removed from the Dow is just sort of the cherry on the sundae," said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's 18A process technology is key to its strategy and its next shot at a new process node after struggling with previous node upgrades. If the technology succeeds, Intel can win over customers and turn itself around. Intel has executed five improved chip nodes in the last four years, resulting in smaller and more powerful transistors, "which is a feat in itself," said Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst of Moor Insights and Strategy. Still, in recent years, Intel has failed to keep up with TSMC in the latest chip nodes. Moorhead added that Intel is investing to "catch up" to its competitors. "Its 18A node appears to be healthy and competitive, which is the key to its turnaround and the ability to recruit more foundry customers," Moorhead said. Intel has announced Amazon as an 18A customer so far. "You have to trust Intel to manufacture your chips on advanced processes, which they've just started adopting, efficiently and on time which they haven't done yet," said Logan Purk, a senior analyst at Edward Jones. Intel plans to spin out its semiconductor manufacturing business into an independent subsidiary called Intel Foundry, separating the manufacturing process from its chip-design business. For this to work, the foundry business will need other major companies, including its rivals, to use Intel to manufacture their chip designs in large volumes. This hasn't happened yet. Other chip companies that have separated their manufacturing and designing have succeeded, said Dan Morgan, a senior trust portfolio manager at Synovus. He pointed to AMD spinning off its manufacturing arm GlobalFoundries as an example, and he estimated that Intel's foundry business alone could be valued as high as $80 billion. Highlighting Intel's challenge here, GlobalFoundries only has a market cap of just $24 billion as of publication time. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has also said that Intel is making progress in cutting costs in their recent staff reductions and real estate sales. "Balance sheet is an area of focus for investors given the company's aggressive capex plan and ongoing losses in the foundry business," Morgan said. Rasgon said Intel is facing a "dire emergency" but likely isn't so desperate as to declare bankruptcy or sell off portions of its business at a fire sale price. Moreover, Intel still holds over 75% of the market share of data center chips and PCs. "It's not like the company's just bleeding out," Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology research and advisory firm Futurum Group, told BI. Washington's concerns about Intel have become a sharper focus as the company has continued to slip from its spot as a top chipmaker. Intel is set to receive billions from the federal government under the CHIPS and Science Act to boost American semiconductor manufacturing — though the company hasn't received any funds yet. If Intel can contain costs and efficiently apply its grant funding, Newman said, "there is a possibility that it could get back to a level of profitability that would make it sustainable." The government has taken other steps to boost Intel. Gina Raimondo, the US secretary of commerce, took multiple private meetings and calls to urge chief executives from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and other firms to buy chips from Intel to shore up the company's manufacturing wing and solidify its role in US-based chip production," The New York Times reported last month. Under Donald Trump's presidential administration, Intel could receive support for domestic manufacturing while facing higher tariffs and pushback on the CHIPS Act. "Under the incoming administration, which arguably has an even greater nationalist tone, homegrown companies actually stand to benefit," said Purk. Not everyone is convinced that government intervention will help Intel get back on track in chip manufacturing. "It's all fine and dandy for the government to say, 'Yeah, we want you to use Intel,'" Rasgon said. "Like, that's great, but it's not going to happen unless Intel can deliver." Intel's foundry business has been slow to take off, and the potential for it to reinvigorate the American chipmaking landscape hasn't stopped rumblings about a possible breakup — with competitors like Qualcomm reportedly interested in buying parts of Intel — or policymakers in Washington discussing potential contingency plans. Officials from the Commerce Department and Sen. Mark Warner, who championed the CHIPS Act, met for precautionary strategy talks to discuss how the government should support Intel if it needs more help, Semafor reported. The report said they also discussed a potential merger between the company's chip design business and a competitor like AMD or Marvell. "If, for some reason, this foundry thing continues to take longer, the losses continue to mount, the technological progress does not take hold, sales falter, or the company's ability to stay together does, I do believe that they are setting it up in that direction to be able to have options — whether they spin it off and take it public separately, or bring private equity into it, or they're able to bring a buyer to the table," Newman said. Intel, the Commerce Department, and a representative for Warner did not respond to requests for comment from BI. Jump to

Title: Internal Tesla salary database shows Elon Musk's strategy: Lower salaries, bigger stock grants

Tesla attracts millions of job seekers annually. The few who receive offers typically face a calculated gamble: Accept lower base pay up front for the chance of a potentially lucrative future payout. Business Insider secured access to an internal Tesla pay database, covering nearly 100,000 employees as of December 2021. That data, along with public filings and interviews with people who have worked for the automaker, reveal the company's pay strategy. Tesla offers lower base salaries than its tech and automotive peers but offers substantial stock grants. Even Tesla's top earners must bet on the company. This high-risk, high-reward system is coupled with a selective hiring process that has in the past included Elon Musk's sign-off for every hire. Using Tesla's internal salary database, BI looked at median base pay for the roughly 13,000 full-time, salaried, US-based employees across the internal job categories that Tesla uses to define workers in business units, such as engineering, manufacturing, or data management. (BI excluded pay for hourly workers, many of whom work in manufacturing, as it was not possible to accurately calculate their median annual pay based on hourly payroll data.) BI further broke down the data to look at median base pay by job title, analyzing the numbers for full-time, US-based, salaried roles with at least five employees. The base pay for these titles, which include directors of engineering and managers who work in Tesla's service centers fixing vehicles, ranges from about $35,000 to $324,000, according to the data. Nine current and former workers told BI the pay structure has largely remained in place since December 2021 and is ultimately part of CEO Musk's quest to hire only the most "hardcore" workers. "The whole system is set up to find the fanatics," a current Tesla worker with knowledge of the company's hiring process said. "They could get better pay somewhere else, but we want the people who are die-hard Tesla." A former recruiter who worked with the company until 2024 said Tesla's interview process for engineers — which typically entails at least nine interviews and can take months — and the company's pay structure are designed to weed out workers who are looking to just "clock in and clock out." "It's a culture thing," the former recruiter said. "It's not even about how smart you are or how much you know. They're looking for a willingness to learn and put in the extra hours." Tesla, Musk, and the company's board of directors did not respond to requests for comment. In a December 2023 regulatory filing, Tesla reported it employed more than 140,000 people worldwide. In April, Tesla told staff it planned to cut more than 10% of its workforce. A June estimate from CNBC placed Tesla's headcount at just over 120,000. Using separate data from the Securities and Exchange Commission, BI compared the company's median base pay with that of traditional automakers and the six largest tech firms by market cap. Tesla lags behind all of them except Amazon. While there are a variety of factors that can affect a company's median salary — for example, Amazon's large warehouse workforce or Apple's large retail workforce — the data is consistent with what four current and former Tesla employees say: Tesla's base salaries are generally less than competitors'. Nvidia, Ford, Meta, and Amazon declined to comment on their employee compensation packages. Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet did not respond to a request for comment. GM said it has doubled its staff in Silicon Valley over the past six months and is competitive in hiring talent away from tech firms. Nine current and former people in engineering and sales said that Tesla's stock grants make it easier to accept lower base salaries. Tesla stock could make them rich, if only on paper. On November 8, the automaker's stock surged more 8% in the wake of Donald Trump's re-election, hitting a market cap of $1 trillion. Some Tesla employees can receive millions of dollars in stock. In 2020 and 2021, 44 US-based employees were offered stock worth more than $1 million, according to the database. To get a sense of which employees were more likely to take home large grants, BI broke up stock grants based on job category. The data show that most workers in engineering received stock grants above $25,000. The value of the stock is based on the value of the shares at the time they were granted, but it's subject to change based on Tesla's share price. Of the stock offerings at Tesla, about 75% were restricted stock units, or RSUs, while nonqualified stock options made up 21%, and were given exclusively as merit-based compensation, according to BI's analysis of US-based, full-time workers. Only 4% of employees — including many executives and other high-level workers — received the stock as incentive stock options, or ISOs. Zaheer Mohiuddin, the cofounder of Levels.fyi, said RSUs are very common in tech, while incentive stock options are typically reserved for longtime high-level employees or nonpublic companies. RSUs are typically included in standard compensation packages, while nonqualified stock options and ISOs are often used as additional incentives. RSUs give employees actual shares that vest over time, while ISOs simply provide the right to purchase stock at a preset price before expiration — which is potentially profitable if the stock price rises above that level, but also requires the employee to have money on hand to pay for the stock in the first place. Outside of one person within Tesla's executive job category who had no stock amount listed, Tesla executives received stock offerings worth between $950,000 and $20 million, according to the database, which displayed the latest stock amount for each employee as of December 2021. All but one of the executives' offerings were ISOs. Tesla is far from the first company to enhance base pay with stock grants. Companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon have been known to offer employees healthy stock grants. Employee survey data from 2024 from the compensation-benchmarking company Levels.fyi found that Tesla's median base pay and stock grants for US-based software engineers are slightly lower than that of US-based software engineers at Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet, collectively. Over the past five years, Tesla's stock has spiked well over 1,000%; that performance potentially makes those grants attractive. Greg Selker, a managing director at the executive recruitment firm Stanton Chase, told BI that while other Big Tech companies might have higher base pay and equity grants to match, Tesla's strength also lies in its image. "There's a mission-driven element to it that allows Tesla to get away with paying less," Selker said. "These people are working to bring about the decarbonization of the planet." Musk has previously described what the stock options can do for employees. "We give everyone stock options; we've made many people who are just working the line — who didn't even know what stocks were — we've made them millionaires," he said last year. BI examined the median stock grants and the percentage of employees who received grants for each job category and found that a majority of workers in nearly every category received some type of stock grant. Tesla's pay strategy has more in common with other Silicon Valley companies like Google or Meta than it does with traditional automakers, Harley Shaiken, an auto industry and labor expert, told BI. Traditional automakers like GM or Ford rely on higher base pay while companies like Tesla, which has seen higher stock returns over the past five years, can attract talent through stock grants, Shaiken said. "Tech workers are looking for the opportunity for a big payday, not just an incremental salary bump," he said. One former sales manager said Tesla's stock offerings initially attracted him to the role, but he compared them to "golden handcuffs." "The stock is the major hook. You might be unhappy in your role, but you just decide, 'I'm going to keep my head down and wait a few months longer until I vest,'" he said. Tesla's stock offerings have given some workers opportunities for major paydays. Drew Baglino, Tesla's former senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, and Zachary Kirkhorn, the former CFO, were awarded $20 million each. Other executives, including Musk's right-hand man Omead Afshar, received $10 million in stock offerings, according to the database. "It's part of the benefit of taking a chance on a company like Tesla," one engineer who joined the company in 2015 told BI. "You might have to deal with the aches and pains of a startup — the long hours, some of the uncertainty — but there can also be a significant payoff." Aaron Greenspan, a vocal critic of Musk and the founder of PlainSite, an organization that provides access to legal documents and advocates for legal transparency, first referenced Afshar's stock grant in a lawsuit filed against defendants including Musk and Tesla, accusing them of defamation, among other claims. Lawyers for Musk and Tesla have called his claims "largely unintelligible allegations." The lawsuit is ongoing. Tesla awards stock grants with promotions and annual reviews and bases them on the company's performance, according to the salary database and conversations with four current employees. Last year, the company cut back on merit-based stock awards for staff, Bloomberg reported and the four employees told BI. In June, Musk told staff he planned to award additional stock grants for "exceptional performance." During annual performance reviews in July, managers were limited to recommending no more than 20% of their team to be considered for the extra award, two people with knowledge said. Tesla typically awards employees restricted stock units that vest over a period of four years, the data show. Selker said historically Tesla workers have been able to count on their stock continuing to grow. "It's a bet they have to make," he said. So far, stock grants have "proven to be better than cash in your pocket." "Now, if the stock were to become inconsistent or halve, then Tesla will have to change its strategy," he added. Tesla's stock has experienced significant volatility this year, slumping as low as 44% in mid-April from its price at the start of the year. Following Donald Trump's re-election, it's up nearly 30% overall year to date. At least one longtime Tesla staffer worries about new hires. "I feel lucky that I got in early, but I see a lot of younger engineers expecting to reap the same benefits," they said. "And I'm not sure they will." Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?

Title: To establish value, focus more on high priority projects: Reading Michael Lynch's post on why he quit Google to work for himself

by Tom Johnson on Nov 11, 2024 categories: technical-writing Although this post by Michael Lynch titled Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself was published in 2018, it trended on Hacker News last week. It caught my attention because I recently underwent a similar promotion process, though with a positive outcome. Lynch, an engineer, highlights a couple of points relevant to technical writers: writing documentation doesn't support an engineer's demonstration of technical complexity, and the projects you work on might matter more than the quality of your output. Documentation doesn’t help engineering promotions The importance of working on high-impact projects Documentation doesn’t help engineering promotions In one of his attempts at promotion, Lynch noted that for one of his projects he “documented the pipeline as I learned it so that the institutional knowledge was available to my teammates instead of siloed in my head.” A cartoon graphic in his post demonstrates what happened: Writing docs is not important for engineering promotion As engineers focus on projects with high technical complexity, writing documentation will be an insignificant footnote for most hiring committees. It’s not a factor in a promo packet in which an engineer must demonstrate how they solved problems involving significant technical complexity. Hence, documentation efforts for most engineers will be put aside because it doesn’t fit into their promotion trajectory. This might help explain why engineers never seem to want to contribute to documentation, even if they’re capable of writing. Lynch writes, “I submitted my first promo packet, and the results were what I feared: the promotion committee said that I hadn’t proven I could handle technical complexity ….” The importance of working on high-impact projects The second highlight from this post is Lynch’s attempt to contribute to an impactful project. Lynch explains: “To continue advancing my career, I’d need projects that were even larger in scope and involved collaboration with more partner teams.” If you work on projects no one cares about, it’s also hard to get promoted. Many of his projects were canceled six months in. I think one reason I was successful in my promotion effort is because of the business group I’m in. The products are a profit center with many high-profile partners and impact. It matters a lot to people in the organization, and I’m the only tech writer for these efforts. In contrast, if I were working on a product that was much less significant to the company’s business interests, then no matter how awesome the documentation I created, it wouldn’t matter much because the product area wouldn’t be significant to the positive impact of the company. I’ve written before about company layoffs and how tech writers can provide value to companies. (See my series titled Reflecting seven years later about why we were laid off.) Lynch’s post suggests that it doesn’t matter how good of a programmer you are; what matters is the importance of the projects you work on. I think I seemed to intuitively understand this, because I’ve consistently gravitated toward more important business areas in the documentation I work on. When I was at Amazon, it was Fire TV more than Kindle and other devices. At Google, it’s the automotive API products. In technical writing roles, you have a surprising ability to focus your efforts on documentation projects you believe in. I have about 60+ documentation bugs sitting in my queue. Which ones do I work on? Which do I prioritize? If a product has an upcoming release, sure, I make sure we have docs for those features. Or if partners are complaining loudly about an issue, I also prioritize those fixes. But beyond those P0 type bugs, there’s a lot of leeway to ignore some products and prioritize others. Making that judgment call could be more significant than the quality of documentation you write. In other words, instead of focusing so much on documentation quality, focus on documentation priority. Are you working on products that matter to the company? In one comment on Hacker News by “nostrademons”, an engineering manager explains that getting promoted is also highly dependent on the manager’s ability to articulate your value in the context of business-significant projects: “Nobody knows or cares how good a programmer you are. Nobody really cares how hard you work either. Your ability to get promoted is basically dependent upon how well your manager knows how to work the system and then whether you listen to your manager. The last promotion packet hinged on work that took him maybe a couple months to do, but that I managed to spin into a big complex project, because it was stuff that folks at the Director/VP level cared about deeply but had no idea how to do …” I’m more and more convinced of that point of view. There are some weeks where you might work extra hard, putting in additional time in the evenings and weekends, and other weeks where you can just coast. No one will likely notice from week to week. What matters more is your general alignment on important, high-impact projects that matter to the business. And more importantly, your manager’s ability to understand that and to highlight your involvement in those projects, spinning up your role in these complex, high-impact projects to promotion committees.

The money manager, who’s been dubbed by the UK press as Britain’s Warren Buffett, is skeptical as he says the world’s largest stock lacks a predictable earnings stream and a strong track record of high return on capital. Smith is avoiding the shares even as he acknowledges that such a move undercuts his portfolio’s performance. “I’m not confident that we know what the future of AI is because there are almost no applications people are paying for,” Smith said in a Nov. 5 interview in Tokyo. “Will they be willing to pay on a sufficient scale and a sufficient price to justify this? Because if not, the suppliers of the chips are going to have a problem.” Smith’s caution strikes at one of the biggest concerns about the future of the artificial intelligence industry: will the revenue generated by the technology ultimately justify the billions of dollars of investments the firms have plowed in? The doubts contributed to a selloff which erased about $900 billion from Nvidia’s market value from a June peak to an August low, although the shares have since rebounded. AI enthusiasts note that Nvidia’s biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., have pledged to pump more into capital spending after splashing a record $59 billion into data center gear and other fixed assets in the third quarter.

But, Smith thinks such hefty margins may not last. “Even if AI is the next big thing and we’re going to be paying enough money to justify it, is there just going to be one manufacturer of these chips?” he said. “If you are making fantastic returns, it attracts competition.” “In fact, if you look at the people who are the big users of the microprocessors that Nvidia is supplying, such as Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle, they have a history of developing their own,” he added.

SHANGHAI, CHINA - NOVEMBER 5, 2024 - Visitors watch to learn about Nvidia's AI technology at ... [+] INCLUSION·Conference on the Bund in Shanghai, China,September 5, 2024. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Our theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks which includes companies that sell hardware and software for server processors, graphics units, memory, and networking equipment, has returned over 44% year-to-date. This compares to the S&P 500 which remains up by about 25% over the same period. The theme had a solid run, driven by excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence technologies, with accelerated computing chip vendors Nvidia and AMD and other players within the computing ecosystem, including memory manufacturers such as Micron seeing meaningful gains. Tech stocks, including AI names, have also moved a bit higher since the U.S. election results earlier this week. See Tesla’s Trump for one stock that has rallied recently. Donald Trump’s win in the 2024 election, along with the possibility of Republicans controlling Congress, could turn out to be a big plus for tech companies pouring money into generative AI. Unlike the Biden administration, which was leaning toward tighter scrutiny of AI development including signing an executive order with new reporting rules for AI companies, Trump’s approach appears to be all about cutting red tape and pushing for deregulation. This could ease compliance-related issues and speed up innovation for technology companies and startups, boosting demand for AI infrastructure components sold by the likes of Nvidia, AMD, and Micron. Plus, since AI data centers consume a considerable amount of energy, Trump’s push to expand energy production and ramp up the fossil fuel supply might improve the availability and pricing of electricity, which would be another indirect win for AI projects. In September, the Fed implemented its first interest rate cut in nearly four years, lowering rates by 50 basis points. Yesterday, it carried out another 25 basis point cut. With the benchmark federal funds rate now at 4.50% to 4.75%, there’s still room for further cuts. While the president does not directly influence monetary policy, Donald Trump has a record of being vocal about lowering interest rates to drive economic growth. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move? Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. The lower rates are particularly beneficial to the broader internet infrastructure theme. Why? A softer rate environment would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia, Micron, and AMD. The economics of the AI revolution are still challenged by high model training and inference costs and the payback equation could become just a bit more favorable with declining interest rates. The increase in the Internet Infrastructure theme over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the theme were 45% in 2021, -38% in 2022, and 68% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could the theme face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a jump? While the structural shift toward greater digitization will drive growth in the theme in the long run, valuations are a bit high, making the risk-to-reward trade-off a bit less attractive for the near term. Within our theme, Nvidia stock has been the strongest performer of late, rising by about 200% over the past 12 months, as demand for graphics processing units surged. On the other side, Cisco stock has been among the weaker performers, returning about 15% over the past 12 months. Did you know that Nvidia recently beat Apple to become the world’s most valuable company and will join the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday?

Title: Big Tech’s hotbeds of employee activism quiet after Trump’s victory

Monday, 11 Nov 2024 Google employees in New York walk out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment claims on Nov 1, 2018. Tech sector executives have worked to dampen employee activism in recent years, a push reflected in workers’ muted public reaction to Donald Trump’s re-election. — The New York Times SEATTLE: If any industry could have said its workplaces were politicised, it was tech. Early in Donald Trump’s first term in the White House, America’s tech giants loudly protested his temporary ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, posted that his great-grandparents were immigrants and that his in-laws were refugees. Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google who immigrated from the Soviet Union as a child, rushed to San Francisco International Airport to protest. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, joined a crowd of employees rallying at the company’s corporate headquarters. “Wow, thank you everyone for showing up today,” he said to cheers. “It’s remarkable.” But after this week’s presidential election, the largely liberal workforces of tech’s biggest companies were quiet. While the definitive nature of the election most likely played a role, the change also represented an effort by executives to dampen employee activism in recent years. They put in place policies restricting dialogue, monitored internal chat channels and vowed not to weigh in on the issues that fired up activist employees. If the presidential election was going to be the biggest test of these new rules, the vigilance wasn’t necessary. Reactions to the election on company message boards and forums were muted. On a companywide Google forum, someone posted an American flag with the note, “Sending support to American colleagues,” which was liked by more than 1,000 employees. “My heart is heavy,” one Amazon employee wrote in an internal chat. “I may not know you, but know that I love you.” The heads of most of the country’s leading tech employers didn’t acknowledge the election results to their staffs, though many of them posted their congratulations to Trump on X, praising his “decisive” and “hard-fought” victory. "Congratulations to President @realDonaldTrump on his decisive victory,” Pichai wrote on X. “We are in a golden age of American innovation and are committed to working with his administration to help bring the benefits to everyone.” Amazon, Meta and Google declined to comment. Trump’s victory landed in an industry deeply changed since his last term. Tech companies had long espoused the idea of bringing your whole self to work, and they were built on a culture of blunt expression. But the turmoil of the past several years — from the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 to the war in the Gaza Strip — have turned off executives from the freewheeling cultures they once fostered. And as they have focused their companies on efficiency coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have also taken a more assertive approach to their own workers, enacting in some cases the largest layoffs in their histories and demanding that people return to working in an office — or show themselves the door. Google since 2019 has instructed employees to keep politics out of the workplace, and this year the company cracked down on its irreverent Memegen forum, its corporate town square, after workers feuded about the war in Gaza. On Monday, Pichai reminded his 181,000 employees not to discuss politics in the workplace regardless of who won the election, according to an email reviewed by The New York Times. “Whomever the voters entrust, let’s remember the role we play at work, through the products we build and as a business: to be a trusted source of information to people of every background and belief,” Pichai wrote. The company is “at its best” when focusing on its mission and products, he added. Employees largely had conversations in smaller groups and more private forums. A few looked for ways to express their discontent without drawing the attention of the company’s internal content moderators. The moderators were removing political posts and temporarily suspending uploading privileges for employees who repeatedly broke the rules, said three people with knowledge of the moderation, who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. CNBC earlier reported on the takedowns and Pichai’s email. Moderators also took down vague posts without captions that were assumed to be about the election, one of the people said, including a number of posts featuring black squares, a symbol of mourning. Meta’s human resources department, with support from Zuckerberg, introduced a policy in late 2022 called “community engagement expectations,” according to a copy of the memo reviewed by the Times. It expressly forbade employees to discuss in the workplace hot-button political issues, including abortion, racial justice movements, wars and political news. Amazon’s senior leaders pulled back this year on issuing frequent statements on political or cultural issues, according to three people familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity. On Tuesday, several Amazon executives spoke about the future in a two-hour companywide meeting and did not mention the election once. Andy Jassy, the company’s CEO, defended its office mandate against claims it was a “backdoor layoff,” expressed hope in the company’s AI innovations and praised experiments to deliver eggs faster to customers. But the real test of tech’s newfound neutrality will be once Trump takes office, if he follows through on his promises on issues the companies have opposed. “Remember the famous travel ban?” he said at a September rally. He vowed to bring it back. – ©2024 The New York Times Company Related stories: What will Trump 2.0 mean for US tech?Before the US election, tech CEOs were quietly courting TrumpTech giants brace for AI revamp, antitrust pullback in Trump 2.0 Before the US election, tech CEOs were quietly courting TrumpTech giants brace for AI revamp, antitrust pullback in Trump 2.0 Tech giants brace for AI revamp, antitrust pullback in Trump 2.0 Topic: Report it to us.

Title: NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock: Ken Fisher’s AI Powerhouse with Unmatched Growth Potential

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. Ken Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory. Under Fisher’s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times’ list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis Ken Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm’s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic. Fisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns. Ken Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks. “As 2024 progressed, and as I said in prior videos early in the year, I expected value to start doing better relative to growth than it had been before. And that didn’t really much happen in the first and second quarters. But in the third quarter of 2024, that’s largely happened, with the exception of the fact that energy, and I was completely wrong about this, energy has continued to do worse than most value.” Additionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources. As short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year. Our Methodology This article explores the top ten stock holdings of Fisher Asset Management, based on 13F filings as of Q2 2024. The stocks are arranged in ascending order according to the stake of Fisher Asset Management, as of June 30, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company’s positive outlook is bolstered by its leadership in the AI and machine learning sectors, where its GPUs are crucial for powering advanced applications, positioning NVIDIA to capitalize on the growing adoption of AI solutions across industries. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s data center segment is also experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the rise in AI and cloud computing as organizations migrate to these services, placing NVIDIA to capture a significant share of this expanding market. With a strong financial foundation, NVIDIA continues to invest heavily in research and development, ensuring it remains at the forefront of innovation. Its robust cash flow further enables strategic acquisitions and partnerships to drive accelerated growth. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) surpassed estimates, reporting a normalized EPS of $0.68, beating projections by $0.04, with revenue of $30.04 billion, exceeding forecasts by $1.29 billion. As NVIDIA approaches its Q4 earnings report on November 20, 2024, analysts project a normalized EPS of $0.74 and revenue of $32.94 billion. Over the last 90 days, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has received 32 upward EPS revisions, reflecting strong investor confidence in its sustained momentum and leadership within the semiconductor industry. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “This focus on consistency also guides our regular trimming of strong performers to manage stock-specific and overall portfolio risk. The quarter saw us continue to trim NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reducing the GPU chipmaker from an active weight in the portfolio to an underweight versus the benchmark. We continue to believe in Nvidia’s 10-year trajectory as hyperscaler and enterprise customers invest in GPU architecture. However, we have reduced our Nvidia position as its valuation now more fully reflects the company’s robust growth path and as estimates have risen to levels that require a very steep growth trajectory to drive further stock appreciation.” Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a global technology leader, renowned for its software, cloud services, and artificial intelligence innovations. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) maintains a bullish outlook, fueled by strategic focus on high-growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and sustainability. The Azure platform continues to lead the cloud market, while Microsoft’s integration of AI tools, notably Copilot in collaboration with OpenAI, reinforces its position as a frontrunner in AI-powered solutions. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s AI advancements are embedded across its product suite, supporting long-term growth as businesses increasingly adopt AI to enhance productivity. Additionally, Microsoft’s sustainability initiatives, including a partnership with Constellation Energy to power data centers with carbon-free energy, align with its goal of achieving net-zero emissions, enhancing both operational efficiency and its environmental reputation. In Q3 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) exceeded expectations with a normalized EPS of $3.30, beating estimates by $0.20, and reported revenue of $65.59 billion, surpassing forecasts by $1.03 billion. As the next earnings report approaches on January 23, 2025, analysts anticipate a normalized EPS of $3.14 and revenue of $68.98 billion. With 24 upward EPS revisions in the past 90 days, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) demonstrates strong momentum and sustained investor confidence in its growth potential. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of best stocks to buy according to Billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Buy and Hold for 5 Years?

We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. On November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank’s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years. Now that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House. McLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment. McLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to “switch course.” On the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close. Datta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions. He suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to “pivot away” from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta. As the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments. To come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Photo by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks third on our list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. NVIDIA is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. There is no doubt about NVIDIA’s position in the technology and AI sector. As part of its recent updates, On October 29, the company revealed Enterprise Reference Architectures. These blueprints will help the company’s partners and customers build AI factories. More recently, on November 6, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with Hugging Face to fuel open-source AI robotics research and development. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to release earnings towards the end of this month, on November 20, 2024. In light of its awaited earning release, on October 19, Vivek Arya analyst at Bank of America, joined CNBC to defend his bullish call on NVDA. Having called the stock a “generational opportunity,” Arya emphasizes that NVDA is trading less than one times its earnings growth, much lower than other names in the magnificent seven. He suggests that NVDA celebrates a large ecosystem encompassing “end-to-end” knowledge, placing it ahead of competitors. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on our list because of its resources and expertise in scalable AI hardware and software solutions. At the end of Q2 2024, 179 hedge funds were bullish on the stock, according to our Insider Monkey database. Ithaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. • CPI inflation, retail sales, producer prices, and more earnings will be in focus this week. • Shopify stands out as a buy, particularly with the holiday season around the corner. • Occidental Petroleum’s challenging landscape makes it one to approach with caution. • Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Unlock access to InvestingPro for less than $8 a month! U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday to cap off their best week of the year, as the Dow and S&P 500 surged to new records after Donald Trump's decisive election victory. Investors are betting that a Trump administration will bring lighter regulation and tax cuts that could boost the U.S. economy. For the week, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 4.6%, the benchmark S&P 500 gained 4.7%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite popped 5.7%. Source: Investing.com The week ahead is expected to be an eventful one as investors assess the outlook for the economy, inflation, interest rates and corporate earnings. On the economic calendar, most important will be Wednesday’s U.S. consumer price inflation report for October, which is forecast to show headline annual CPI rising 2.4% year-over-year. Other noteworthy economic reports include U.S. retail sales data, as well as a report on producer prices, will help fill out the inflation picture. Source: Investing.com That will be accompanied by a heavy slate of Fed speakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday. Elsewhere, the earnings season continues, with the list of notable names due to report including Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, November 11 - Friday, November 15. Shopify stands out as a top buy this week, as the e-commerce software leader is anticipated to deliver another quarter of strong top-line growth and provide an upbeat outlook thanks to robust growth across key metrics. Shopify’s report is set for release Tuesday at 7:00 AM ET. Market participants expect a sizable swing in SHOP stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of approximately 14% in either direction. Shares gapped up 26% after its last earnings report in August. Source: InvestingPro Analysts have raised profit forecasts 33 times in recent weeks, as per an InvestingPro survey, highlighting confidence in Shopify’s continued expansion. Wall Street expects adjusted EPS to rise 14% to $0.27, while revenue is set to increase 23% to over $2.1 billion, driven by positive merchant growth and consistent demand for Shopify’s suite of software and payment tools. Additionally, Shopify has a proven seasonal advantage: its stock tends to gain momentum leading up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday (NASDAQ:MNDY) (BFCM). Historically, shares have risen about 7% in the two weeks prior to BFCM from 2016 to 2023, showing resilience as demand spikes ahead of the holiday shopping season. As more merchants capitalize on e-commerce for the holiday rush, Shopify remains well-positioned for upside. SHOP stock ended at $87.12 on Friday, its highest closing price since February 12. Shares have gained 11.8% year-to-date. At current levels, the Ottawa, Canada-based e-commerce specialist has a market cap of $112.5 billion. Source: Investing.com As InvestingPro points out, Shopify sports a near perfect ‘Financial Health’ score of 4.0 out of 5.0 thanks to its favorable positioning in the software application industry, which has allowed it to leverage a resilient business model and strong profit growth.

In contrast, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is facing a more challenging outlook, making it a strong sell this week due to an unpredictable energy market and fluctuating oil prices. The company is scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings report after the market closes at 4:15PM ET on Tuesday. According to the options market, traders are pricing in a swing of around 6% in either direction for OXY stock following the print. The energy sector’s current uncertainties make Occidental’s path to growth more complicated, with the company navigating complex conditions around global demand and strategic shifts within the industry. Source: InvestingPro The oil and gas producer’s earnings outlook has dimmed, with 16 of 17 analysts reducing their EPS forecasts in recent weeks, reflecting a challenging market. Earnings are expected to decline 36.4% year-over-year to $0.75 per share on revenue of $7.1 billion, down 4% annually. This decrease comes amid volatile oil prices and ongoing debates around the global energy demand outlook. Although Occidental has made moves to enhance its position within the sector, including recent strategic initiatives, near-term pressures continue to weigh on the stock. Consequently, the risk of underperformance appears higher as the company battles broader market uncertainties and industry-specific hurdles. OXY stock closed at $50.53 on Friday, not far from a recent 52-week low of $49.51 touched on November 1. Shares are down 15.4% in 2024. At current valuations, the Houston, Texas-based company has a market cap of $47 billion.

Title: Inflation and retail sales data greet a roaring stock market rally: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks just had their best week of 2024. All three major indexes pressed to record highs after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 4.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose nearly 6%. In the week ahead, a fresh reading on inflation and retail sales will lead the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), and Disney (DIS) will highlight another week of earnings reports. In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last Thursday. In a press conference following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to comment on the central bank's plans for future rate cuts. "We don’t think it’s a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance," Powell said. He later noted that Fed officials will need to gauge the economic data released between now and December before knowing if the central bank will cut interest rates again this year. The first data the Fed will consider ahead of its next meeting will come out on Wednesday with the release of the October Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 2.6% annually in October, an increase from the 2.4% rise in September. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, in line with the increase seen in September. On a "core" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to have risen 3.3% over last year in October, unchanged from September's increase. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the September gain. "The October CPI report will likely support the notion that the last mile of inflation's journey back to target will be the hardest," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. The final monthly retail sales report before the start of the holiday shopping season is set for release on Thursday. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.3% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.3%. Entering the release, several trackers point to the fourth quarter being off to a solid start for economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker currently projects the US economy growing at 2.5%. Disney is set to report quarterly results before the bell on Thursday as the media giant looks to continue to improve its streaming business amid further declines in linear television. Investors will also be focused on results within the company's theme park business after the segment fell short in its most recent quarter. Streaming profitability should be a bright spot after the company reported its first quarter of profits for that business in August. The segment should get a boost from recent price hikes along with the continued rollout of Disney's password-sharing crackdown across its various platforms. Shares are up about 9% this year. In a roaring rally over the final three trading sessions of the week, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy. Big Tech also saw significant upside. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — hit a fresh record highs on both Thursday and Friday. Three of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazon, outpaced the S&P 500 on the week, with Alphabet also coming close. Tesla had a unique Trump-related catalyst, with investors banking on CEO Elon Musk's big bet on the president-elect's campaign paying off. Broadly, markets seemed to be pricing in the potential for less government regulation over Big Tech in a second Trump term. Perhaps indicative of the tech industry's high hopes, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai all rushed to congratulate Trump on his victory. The week's stock moves also coincided with a surge in Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nearly hitting 4.5%. Strategists have often cited a "flight to quality" environment when yields rise, where money flows to large corporations with solid earnings growth and healthy balance sheets. Big Tech fits this mold and saw a rally when yields rose back in the spring. Small caps were one of the beneficiaries of the post-Trump election rally. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) small-cap index jumped more than 5% on Wednesday for its best day in nearly two years. It closed the week up more than 8% for its best week since April 2020 and is now closing in on its all-time high. This leaves investors with a question that's been prompted throughout 2024: With the Fed set to keep lowering interest rates, is now the time to pile into small caps? In a Friday webinar, Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz said not yet. The index has more short-term debt than the S&P 500 and would be a clear beneficiary of lower interest rates. But it also has another key difference from large-cap indexes right now: Earnings estimates aren't rising. While Kantrowitz's research shows 2024 full-year earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have increased over the last 90 days, earnings estimates for the small-cap S&P 600 (^SP600) index have been falling. "In the last 20 days ... we've definitely seen small cap estimates at the margin move pretty sharply lower," Kantrowitz said. He added that investors would want to see earnings accelerating to signal the start of a recovery. "[It's] not something we're seeing quite yet," Kantrowitz said. "So something we'll be monitoring."

In a roaring rally over the final three trading sessions of the week, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy. Big Tech also saw significant upside. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — hit a fresh record highs on both Thursday and Friday. Three of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazon, outpaced the S&P 500 on the week, with Alphabet also coming close. Tesla had a unique Trump-related catalyst, with investors banking on CEO Elon Musk's big bet on the president-elect's campaign paying off. Broadly, markets seemed to be pricing in the potential for less government regulation over Big Tech in a second Trump term. Perhaps indicative of the tech industry's high hopes, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai all rushed to congratulate Trump on his victory. The week's stock moves also coincided with a surge in Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nearly hitting 4.5%. Strategists have often cited a "flight to quality" environment when yields rise, where money flows to large corporations with solid earnings growth and healthy balance sheets. Big Tech fits this mold and saw a rally when yields rose back in the spring. Small caps were one of the beneficiaries of the post-Trump election rally. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) small-cap index jumped more than 5% on Wednesday for its best day in nearly two years. It closed the week up more than 8% for its best week since April 2020 and is now closing in on its all-time high. This leaves investors with a question that's been prompted throughout 2024: With the Fed set to keep lowering interest rates, is now the time to pile into small caps? In a Friday webinar, Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz said not yet. The index has more short-term debt than the S&P 500 and would be a clear beneficiary of lower interest rates. But it also has another key difference from large-cap indexes right now: Earnings estimates aren't rising. While Kantrowitz's research shows 2024 full-year earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have increased over the last 90 days, earnings estimates for the small-cap S&P 600 (^SP600) index have been falling. "In the last 20 days ... we've definitely seen small cap estimates at the margin move pretty sharply lower," Kantrowitz said. He added that investors would want to see earnings accelerating to signal the start of a recovery. "[It's] not something we're seeing quite yet," Kantrowitz said. "So something we'll be monitoring."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks just had their best week of 2024. All three major indexes pressed to record highs after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 4.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose nearly 6%. In the week ahead, a fresh reading on inflation and retail sales will lead the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), and Disney (DIS) will highlight another week of earnings reports. In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last Thursday. In a press conference following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to comment on the central bank's plans for future rate cuts. "We don’t think it’s a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance," Powell said. He later noted that Fed officials will need to gauge the economic data released between now and December before knowing if the central bank will cut interest rates again this year. The first data the Fed will consider ahead of its next meeting will come out on Wednesday with the release of the October Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 2.6% annually in October, an increase from the 2.4% rise in September. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, in line with the increase seen in September. On a "core" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to have risen 3.3% over last year in October, unchanged from September's increase. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the September gain. "The October CPI report will likely support the notion that the last mile of inflation's journey back to target will be the hardest," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. The final monthly retail sales report before the start of the holiday shopping season is set for release on Thursday. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.3% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.3%. Entering the release, several trackers point to the fourth quarter being off to a solid start for economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker currently projects the US economy growing at 2.5%. Disney is set to report quarterly results before the bell on Thursday as the media giant looks to continue to improve its streaming business amid further declines in linear television. Investors will also be focused on results within the company's theme park business after the segment fell short in its most recent quarter. Streaming profitability should be a bright spot after the company reported its first quarter of profits for that business in August. The segment should get a boost from recent price hikes along with the continued rollout of Disney's password-sharing crackdown across its various platforms. Shares are up about 9% this year. In a roaring rally over the final three trading sessions of the week, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy. Big Tech also saw significant upside. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — hit a fresh record highs on both Thursday and Friday. Three of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazon, outpaced the S&P 500 on the week, with Alphabet also coming close. Tesla had a unique Trump-related catalyst, with investors banking on CEO Elon Musk's big bet on the president-elect's campaign paying off. Broadly, markets seemed to be pricing in the potential for less government regulation over Big Tech in a second Trump term. Perhaps indicative of the tech industry's high hopes, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai all rushed to congratulate Trump on his victory. The week's stock moves also coincided with a surge in Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nearly hitting 4.5%.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

UPDATED 06:33 EST / NOVEMBER 10 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend.

Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / NOVEMBER 10 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution?

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stands against the other best stocks under $100. Wall Street experts believe that mid-cap stocks might be well-placed for a strong run-up. As per Ryan Detrick (Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group), historically, midcaps outperform once the US Fed actually initiates cutting rates. According to him, the small and mid-caps are expected to surge up to 20% over the upcoming 12 months, far exceeding the large-cap counterparts. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs believes that mid-caps outperform large- and small-cap stocks over the 12 months after the first rate cut. As market experts continue to expect a soft landing, the investors might look for other options apart from the biggest companies. As per the earnings sight report from FactSet dated 1st November, the S&P 500 continues to report mixed results. The Q3 remained strong for risk assets and safe havens, with the US markets delivering an all-time closing high to finish Q3 and bonds posting positive returns, as per JPMorgan Asset Management. Overall, the S&P 500 gaining for 4th straight quarter (making 18 new highs), and the US Treasuries and corporate bonds rallying with the decline in yields dominated much of the movements in Q3 2024. The asset management firm also added that gold saw its biggest gain since Q1 2016 (thanks to the expectations of faster rate cuts) and China’s stimulus supported equity market returns. What is expected for Q4 2024 now? JPM believes that positive expected earnings growth, cooling inflation, easing policies of central banks, and firm job creation should help create a strong backdrop for risk assets. Wall Street analysts believe that mid-caps might be in a position to see strong growth moving forward. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. As per BofA’s Jill Carey Hall, mid-caps can be considered as the “best hedge” for the near term. According to Hall, the mid-caps have experienced better recent guidance and revision trends and have also surpassed the small caps on average in the downturn scenarios. Mid-caps can also act as a hedge against fewer-than-expected rate cuts, considering that small caps are rate-sensitive. According to Goldman’s Jenny Ma, the start of the rate-cut cycle remains a potential source of incremental equity demand and a boost to broader investor risk sentiment. Moreover, over the short term, mid-cap performance as compared to other segments is expected to be dependent on the strength of economic growth data, along with the pace of the easing cycle. As per Wells Fargo, mid-cap growth stocks are technically oversold as of now. Despite this, these stocks have a significant scope to outperform. It also added that stability in their earnings, risk, liquidity, and balance sheet appear to be more attractive as compared to small caps. With these trends in mind, let’s take a look at the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In. To list the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In, we first used a screener to extract stocks trading under $100. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A professional financial analyst studying data on a computer, illustrating the company's index investment decisions. Stock Price as of November 6: $96.08 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of coffee. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)’s brand strength stems from its pricing power, attractive unit-level economics, and successful international replication. Wall Street remains optimistic about the leadership change. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) brought in Brian Niccol as its new Chairman and CEO. Analysts opine that his experience in fueling operational efficiencies, improving marketing strategies, and fostering product innovation should be a perfect fit for the company’s current needs. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) will continue to benefit from a healthy brand presence and customer loyalty throughout various generational cohorts. Its focus on improving throughput, enhancing digital marketing, and driving product innovation appears to be critical for maintaining and strengthening its competitive edge. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been emphasizing product innovation as a critical driver of customer interest and sales growth. The company’s initiatives which are focused on streamlining operations, optimizing store formats, and leveraging technology for improved efficiency are expected to yield substantial benefits. Analysts at Morgan Stanley increased their price target on the shares of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) from $98.00 to $115.00, giving it an “Overweight” rating on 16th October. ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Similarly, we took advantage of a business reset at Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the third quarter to initiate a position in the global coffee retailer. A confluence of factors, including degraded store-level operations and long consumer wait times, consumer fatigue with high prices and weakening engagement among occasional Starbucks customers has led to declining U.S. same-store sales growth. While the path ahead will likely require reinvestment back into the business, there are many merits to Starbucks’ business including its strong brand name and category leading market position. In response to recent challenges, Starbucks has appointed change-agent CEO Brian Niccol, who we know from the Strategy’s ownership of Chipotle Mexican Grill during its turnaround. Niccol has a successful track record of investing in product innovation and fixing execution issues, which we believe are the primary challenges facing Starbucks today. Starbucks represents the kind of successful playbook we have executed on historically – focusing on high-quality businesses and brands while being disciplined around the entry point into investments with attractive risk-reward opportunities.” Overall, SBUX ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks under $100 to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SBUX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than SBUX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. Former Google lead Andrew Yeung has been dubbed the Gatsby of Silicon Valley. He shared the coffee chat formula that's helped him grow his seven-figure tech event business. On the agenda today: But first: What happens next after Donald Trump's resounding US election victory. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. The most expensive presidential election in history is over, and the effects of Donald Trump's victory are already being felt in dollars and cents. Stocks surged, finishing the week at record highs. Bitcoin also hit record highs, while Tesla surpassed a $1 trillion market cap. Treasury yields also finished the week higher, as investors bet that a Trump White House will drive inflation. Big companies are already weighing the potential impact of tariffs. Outdoors brand Yeti is looking for new suppliers. Steve Madden plans to cut its sourcing of goods from China. Airbus said it expects to pass the cost of any tariffs on to airline customers. In Silicon Valley, many venture capitalists and startup founders are cheering the prospect of less regulation and increased deal activity. On Wall Street, too, there's hope of less onerous regulation, particularly as several financiers are offering advice to the incoming administration. And at least one media CEO hopes Trump's win will open the doors to consolidation. Goldman Sachs promoted 95 executives to its highest designation of leaders outside the C-suite. The new class is the largest number of partners to be promoted under CEO David Solomon. It's also one of Goldman's most diverse. A record 26 are women — a demographic that has been closely watched following a series of high-profile female partner exits — as well as a record level of Hispanic executive promotions, a company exec said. Check out the list. Also read: In an all-hands meeting this week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained the company's recent plan to reduce the number of managers. According to a recording of the meeting obtained by BI, Jassy said the move was meant to root out bureaucracy. The goal is to make faster decisions and reduce management layers that are killing Amazon's unique culture, Jassy said. "The reality is that the S team and I hate bureaucracy," Jassy said, referring to Amazon's most senior leadership team. More from the all-hands meeting. Also read: There's no such thing as free lunch — or in one investor's case, free dinner. As a retiree, he was used to avoiding the countless postcards offering a fancy dinner accompanied by a presentation on investing advice. But on one occasion in 2010, he took the bait. There, he met one of the hosts who would eventually advise him to invest in financial products that ultimately cost him a chunk of his retirement savings. Why these 'free lunch seminars' are common in the industry. Regular Americans are shoplifting everything from tape measures to blocks of cheese. Rather than stealing out of true necessity, these shoplifters are opportunists: adults with decent jobs, firmly in the middle class. And they don't feel particularly bad about it. Some of them view shoplifting as a silly childhood habit they never kicked out, while others think of it as a way to fight back against goods that are unjustly expensive. Behind regular people's retail theft.

Title: Post-Presidential Election: Stocks, Bonds, And The Fed
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/11/09/post-presidential-election-stocks-bonds-and-the-fed/
Time Published: 2024-11-10T00:12:33Z
Full Content:
Despite control of the House of Representatives still being unclear, stock prices and bonds yields ... [+] moved sharply higher in the wake of the Presidential election. The S&P 500 rose by 4.7% for the week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), surged ahead by 8.3%. Financial markets had a sizable reaction to the U.S. elections despite some of the results still being unclear. Stock Returns While it is now certain that Donald Trump has regained the presidency and the Republicans will control the Senate, enough votes are still being counted to make the fate of the House of Representatives unclear. Betting markets and other sources indicate that the Republicans should retain a slight majority in the House. Either outcome has historically satisfactory outcomes for stock returns. U.S. Government Control: Stock Returns (1933-2023) Stocks have been higher two-thirds of the time post-election until the end of the year, with a median rise of 3.7%. Focusing on the worst historical return, the decline of 10.2% was after President Obama’s election, with the country mired in recession and a global financial crisis. The results thus far have been better than average, with the S&P 500 rising 3.7% since the election. Politics is not the only factor influencing stocks and is usually not the most critical factor. A detailed analysis of the history of elections and stock returns is here. Stock Returns Between Presidential Election and Year-End (1952-2020) According to Strategas, the year after an open presidential election, with the incumbent not running, the returns from stocks have generally been positive if an economic downturn is avoided. Looking at the two negative results, the U.S. economy entered into recession in the fourth quarter of 1969 and the first quarter of 2001. The year 2000 also marked the popping of the internet stock bubble. Stock Returns 1-Year After Open Presidential Elections While the evidence shows that investors should not make macro investment decisions based solely on their political beliefs, it is worth noting the likely policies that could benefit specific companies or industries. President Trump is expected to wield tariffs as a weapon, though China should be his primary target rather than a broad tariff on all countries. Investors should be mindful of China’s exposure to companies in both supply chain and end markets. The Trump administration should be more amenable to mergers and acquisitions than the Biden administration. Regulatory burdens are likely to be reduced, which has already shown up in the performance of bank stocks, which have outperformed the S&P 500 since the election. If the Republicans retain the House, a corporate tax cut becomes more likely. Goldman Sachs estimates that a corporate statutory tax rate reduction to 15% from 21% would boost corporate earnings by 4%. Higher-taxed companies, which include more domestically focused companies and small-caps, would benefit more if the corporate tax rate is reduced. Bond yields have been rising since mid-September as the economy has proved more resilient than expected, and increasing optimism that the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle will allow the economy to avoid a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked after President Trump’s victory but has since settled down slightly higher than before the results. The behavior of bond yields is analogous to many assets after the election, with a knee-jerk reaction followed by some moderation or stability. U.S. Treasury Yields The silver lining of the increase in yields is that it is due to expectations of better economic growth rather than increasing inflation. Looking at the real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yield illustrates that inflation fears are not the culprit for the rise in yields. Rising yields typically act as a headwind for stocks, but better economic growth leads to higher earnings expectations, which can offset the drag. Economic growth expectations rose, reflected in the sharp increase of real yields after Trump’s election, but have since moderated to slightly above the level prior. Real U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield The post-election boost in confidence about economic growth translated to a spike in the outperformance of the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks versus the less sensitive defensives. The outperformance has moderated slightly but remains well above pre-election levels. Small-cap stocks, defined as the Russell 2000, have seen sharp outperformance after the election. The Russell 2000 has risen by 6.2% since the election. Multiple factors have likely driven this small-cap re-awakening. Small-cap stocks are typically more economically sensitive and would be more significant beneficiaries of any corporate tax cut. In addition, many smaller companies are more domestically focused and have less exposure to any tariff trade war with China. Banks, which soared by 8.2% since the election, are likely to benefit from less regulation but also get a tailwind from lower tax rates and better economic growth. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks Within the S&P 500, 102 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With the earnings season nearing completion, the pace of the third-quarter earnings reports slows drastically, with only 11 S&P 500 companies scheduled. S&P 500 Earnings Season Among the companies reporting this week are Home Depot (HD), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Cisco Systems (CSCO), and Walt Disney (DIS). According to FactSet, the healthcare sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. With the earnings season almost complete, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +5.3% year-over-year, above the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, and an improvement over the previous week’s 5.1%. S&P 500 Earnings Season As expected, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) on Thursday. Markets are pricing in another 25 basis points cut in December, but it is far from a sure thing. Chair Powell’s remarks added little to clarify the situation beyond noting that this was not a time for full-throated forward guidance but that monetary policy is still “restrictive,” which supports better-than-fifty percent odds of a December cut. Incoming economic data will remain crucial to the pace of future rate cuts. On Wednesday, consumer inflation (CPI) will be parsed for signs of a revival in inflation. Friday’s retail sales will give insights into the health of the U.S. consumer and, thus, the economy, but it is likely to be noisy due to the pull forward of purchases due to the port strike and hurricanes. Hurricane damage from Helene and Milton should boost building material sales in this month's report. Number of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Financial markets had a sizable reaction to the U.S. elections despite some of the results still being unclear. Stocks and bonds had a knee-jerk reaction to the election, generally followed by some moderation or stability. Fed Chair Powell provided little guidance for the future pace of rate cuts, so this week’s consumer inflation (CPI) and retail sales data will be closely watched.
