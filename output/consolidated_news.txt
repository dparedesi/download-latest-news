Almost €32 billion in fossil fuel investment was held by Irish-based subsidiaries of finance companies last year, a new report claims. The sheer level of money involved ranks Ireland 14th in global terms and renders the State a “key global centre for investment”. The research report, The Hidden Truth: Ireland’s Role in the Global Fossil Fuel Industry, is published by Trócaire and ActionAid Ireland on Wednesday. The organisations are calling for direct regulation of financial institutions that would require them to adopt and implement transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement on climate. “Ireland is facilitating the reckless pursuit of profit by financial institutions and corporations, which continue to pursue further expansion of oil and gas in spite of all the warnings and at the expense of the planet,” said Siobhán Curran, Trócaire’s head of policy and advocacy. “The carbon footprint of these financial flows is bigger than Ireland’s yearly emissions. This completely undermines efforts that are being taken to reduce emissions and ... means Ireland is playing an outsize role in fuelling the climate crisis.” ExxonMobil, which, according to the report, had €33.6 billion in profits in 2023, is singled out as the top fossil fuel investment held by asset managers based in Ireland. It also claims that, in 2023, such investments generated an estimated 72.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, more than the levels produced nationally. Tax and corporate regulation reforms at EU level are called for given that the regulation of the financial sector “remains weak and fragmented”. According to the authors, 91 per cent of investments made here were to companies that have plans for fossil fuel expansion. “Ireland may not have a domestic fossil fuel industry, but it is clear we are deeply complicit in fuelling the global climate emergency, providing a tax-friendly financial gateway for some of the most destructive industries on the planet,” said Karol Balfe, chief executive of ActionAid Ireland. The report states that, in monetary terms, as of June 2024, Irish-based subsidiaries of investment companies held €31.76 billion in bonds and shares issued by fossil fuel firms. “Ireland ranks 14th globally in terms of fossil fuel investment by manager location,” it notes. “Alongside Switzerland, Ireland is one of the only two jurisdictions with such significant fossil fuel investments without having a big fossil fuel industry of its own.” The largest volume of investments via Ireland includes US asset manager BlackRock with €18.9 billion, the report claims. US peer State Street was found to have €4.4 billion, and French banking conglomerate Crédit Agricole €2.1 billion. The report is critical of the State’s foreign direct investment policy which it identifies as a contributing factor in cultivating a financial landscape that facilitates capital movement.

Title: Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum: BlackRock CIO Ends The Debate

As BlackRock accelerates its expansion into digital assets in 2025, the divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum in institutional adoption has become increasingly pronounced. In a interview on the Empire podcast, Samara Cohen, Senior Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments at BlackRock, offered a rare window into how the world’s largest asset manager views the two largest crypto assets — and why Bitcoin stands decisively ahead of Ethereum in client demand and portfolio integration. BlackRock’s historic launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) marked a pivotal moment in the firm’s digital asset strategy. “It was all three of those things,” Cohen said, referring to the factors that drove the Bitcoin product launch. “But it really did start with the investment thesis and client demand to market structure and readiness to obviously the regulatory backdrop.” Cohen emphasized that before any regulatory greenlight, BlackRock’s decision was rooted in the strong desire from investors to access Bitcoin as part of diversified portfolios. The launch of IBIT was not BlackRock’s first move into Bitcoin. In 2022, the firm introduced a private Bitcoin trust for institutional clients, a critical internal milestone. “We didn’t get hands-on to actual Bitcoin until we launched that institutional product in 2022,” Cohen explained. “That was a very important institutional moment for us to just get comfortable with the workflows and the risk management and the systems.” The demand for Bitcoin was both broader and deeper than many had anticipated. IBIT has become the most successful ETP launch in history, a fact Cohen attributes in part to a previously untapped segment of investors. “Broadly speaking, about half of IBIT’s holders right now are what we call self-directed investors,” she noted. “For 3/4 of that population, they set up a brokerage account in some cases and bought their first ETP because they wanted their Bitcoin in the ETP wrapper.” This stands in sharp contrast to Ethereum, where Cohen’s tone was notably more cautious. While BlackRock has also launched Ethereum-based ETPs, demand has been far less robust. “Ethereum is still a distant second,” she said when discussing institutional investor interest. Unlike Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value and a diversifying asset class, Ethereum’s investment thesis has yet to solidify at the institutional level. Cohen elaborated on the complexity institutions face when evaluating Ethereum. “You might be really bullish on the utility of the public Ethereum blockchain but not know how that translates into value accrual to the native token,” she said. This uncertainty complicates the case for broad-based adoption. While Bitcoin’s narrative as a “borderless store of value” is relatively straightforward, Ethereum’s positioning remains more opaque, intertwining technological utility with questions about token economics, competition, and long-term market dynamics. Beyond the narrative gap, Cohen identified a more structural obstacle: crypto’s general lack of standardized data and metrics. “Crypto does broadly have a data and standards problem,” she stated. Drawing comparisons to traditional markets, Cohen emphasized that metrics like cash flow, governance, and team transparency — critical components for equity investing — are largely absent or inconsistent across most crypto assets. “If I think about indexing fundamentally as an organizing technology for a market, how do you perform that task in crypto right now?” she asked rhetorically, highlighting how foundational standards remain missing even in leading crypto ecosystems. Bitcoin’s adoption, by contrast, is supported by clearer metrics around its scarcity, issuance schedule, and market infrastructure maturity, making it easier to fit into traditional portfolio models. Cohen confirmed that BlackRock recommends a 1–2% Bitcoin allocation for investors seeking exposure, rooted in detailed analysis of risk contribution to portfolios. “If you go beyond 2%, the incremental contribution to overall portfolio volatility gets exponentially higher,” she warned. While Ethereum continues to make technological strides — particularly in decentralized finance and onchain applications — BlackRock’s view, at least for now, reflects the reality that institutions require clarity, standardization, and well-defined valuation models before committing meaningful capital. As Cohen summarized, “Understanding how to create a valuation framework for Ethereum or any other token gets more complicated.” At press time, BTC traded at $95,120.

Title: Ireland among top countries enabling investment in fossil fuels

Stock image. Photo: PA Irish branches of international financial institutions are facilitating billions of euro in investments in expanding fossil-­fuel operations around the world, new research shows. The analysis found the largely Dublin-­based operations held more than €31bn in oil, gas and other fossil-fuel investments last year. More than 90pc of those investments were in companies that are continuing or expanding oil and gas exploration. That is despite global pledges by governments to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions, for which fossil fuels are the primary source. The research was carried out for Trócaire and ActionAid Ireland, which are calling on the Government to stop private finance flowing through Ireland to fossil-fuel companies. Ireland enacted the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act in 2018 which pulled public money out of fossil fuels by prohibiting the state-owned Strategic Investment Fund from buying shares in them. However, the rules do not apply to private companies that either invest directly in fossil fuels or act on behalf of investors. Trócaire and ActionAid will meet politicians in Leinster House today to present their report and ask for amendments to the law. “The findings in this report are shocking,” ActionAid Ireland chief executive Karol Balfe said. “Ireland may not have a domestic fossil fuel industry, but it is clear we are deeply complicit in fuelling the global climate emergency, providing a tax-friendly ­financial gateway for some of the most destructive industries on the planet.” The report found that Ireland ranked 14th in the world in terms of managing international fossil-fuel investments. That puts Ireland ahead of much ­larger countries such as Russia, Kuwait and Brazil, which are major ­fossil-fuel ­producers. It calculated that the investments that flowed through Ireland in 2023 fuelled 72.5 million tonnes (mt) of carbon emissions – 10.5mt more than Ireland’s total national emissions for the year. Ms Balfe said none of this activity could be justified in countries that had signed up to the landmark Paris Agreement on cutting global emissions. “There is no credible path to climate safety if financial flows to fossil fuels, including those channelled through Ireland, are not shut down,” she said. “This means direct regulation of financial institutions, requiring them to adopt and implement transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement.” Siobhán Curran, of Trócaire, said the aid agency was seeing first-hand the impacts of the continued support of the fossil-fuel industry in countries suffering severe droughts, floods, population displacement and other deadly effects of climate change. The Irish-based operations identified as holding the biggest investments in fossil fuels include BlackRock and State Street, both US-owned; Credit Agricole (France); Marsh McLennan (US); Intesa Sanpaolo (Italy); Banco Mediolanum (Italy); Power Corporation of Canada; Neuberger Berman (US); ­FinecoBank (Italy); and Zurich Insurance (Switzerland).

April 29, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Rocket Lab on February 27, 2025 with a Class Period from November 12, 2024 to February 25, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Rocket Lab have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Title: South Florida’s Real Estate Center Of Gravity Is Finally Moving West

ByPeter Lane Taylor ByPeter Lane Taylor, Contributor. By dollar value, it’s been a big month for Florida luxury real estate. Last week, a 15-acre Naples waterfront estate closed for a whopping $225 million, the second highest home sale price in U.S. history and a new state record, dwarfing the $173 million Oracle’s Larry Ellison paid for his Manalapan estate south of Palm Beach in 2022. According to news reports, activist investor David Hoffmann is also under contract on a separate Naples estate for an undisclosed sum north of $100 million. Across the Everglades on the other side of the state, high eight-figure deals are closing at an equivalent clip, including a La Gorce Island estate in Miami Beach which recently settled for $75 million. In total, sixteen homes priced at $40 million-plus have sold in Florida in the past six months. The Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg just launched sales. The development is the fourth Waldorf Astoria Residences in the U.S. after Miami, Denver, and Pompano Beach The islands between downtown Miami and Miami Beach on Biscayne Bay, including Star Island in the foreground, feature some of the most expensive waterfront estates in America These are big numbers in short order even by Florida’s recent standards, particularly with the stock market whipsawing, the full measure of President Trump’s tariffs still unknown, and the risk of a wider economic downturn looking more plausible by the day. More broadly, the sales reaffirm several current trends. First, the asymmetry between the two ends of the housing market is widening further. On the mid to lower six-figure pitch where most Americans play, the majority of buyers are still spooked by punitive interest rates, stubborn inflation, and a legitimate unease about buying high. Not surprisingly, overall inventory is up, appreciation is decelerating, and sellers no longer have the stronger hand. The other end of the housing market is showing more verve and braggadocio: before COVID, multi-million dollar properties could sit for years. Today, in most markets, they are still trading briskly while largely resisting the headwinds depressing the rest of the industry. Affluent real estate markets with limited inventory like Aspen have experienced a noticeable increase in sales activity since the pandemic The growing asymmetry signals a hardening of a second trend originally triggered by the pandemic. With fiscal certainty still at a premium, wealthy buyers who can close all-cash deals are continuing to seek safe harbor in hard assets with limited supply: ergo, ultra-luxury real estate in NIMBY-enclaves where tight geography and even tighter zoning regulations keep inventory scarce and prices elevated. The S&P 500’s 77% bump since COVID also has roughly doubled the world’s eight and nine figure multi-millionaires. As a result, the overall demand for high-end residences in rarified communities with small airports and long runways, such as Aspen, Park City, Palo Alto, and Naples, looks to remain frothy for the foreseeable future. The third trend borne out of the past month’s lather is geographic. If anything were poised to suck the oxygen out of Florida’s luxury real estate boom since the pandemic, it still hasn’t happened yet. And the state’s financial center of gravity is finally, inevitably moving west. Billionaire's Row: The Central Park (l) and Steinway Towers (r) at sunset along 57th St. in Manhattan This is all welcome news for Ryan Shear, Managing Partner at Property Markets Group (PMG), a Miami-based real estate development firm founded by Kevin Maloney in 1991 that’s behind some of America’s most architecturally iconic — and exclusive — residential high rises, including 111 W. 57th St. on Manhattan’s ‘Billionaire’s Row’ (a.k.a. “the world's skinniest skyscraper”) which, at 1,428’, ranks as the second tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere. This week, Shear and PMG’s other Managing Partner, Dan Kaplan, announced the launch of the firm’s newest precipitus opus: the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg, a soaring 50-story tower that will be the Florida city’s tallest, priciest, and most palatial building once completed in 2030. For the storied hotel brand — originally founded in New York City in 1893 (now owned by Hilton) — the new development will be its fourth residential high rise in the U.S., following groundbreaking on the Waldorf Astoria Pompano Beach this month, the launch of Waldorf Astoria Denver Cherry Creek last year, and the Waldorf Astoria Miami which is currently under construction. For PMG, the project signifies an ever-deeper push into the luxury branded residence space and its biggest bet yet that the hyper-posh, super-amenitized, starchitect-designed high rise formula the company has mastered in Miami is just getting started on the other side of the state. Floor to ceiling windows frame endless Tampa Bay and Gulf views from every floor of the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg Gourmet kitchens at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg Priced out of Miami, many high net worth individuals are moving their money and Florida's real estate momentum to the state's Gulf Coast including cities like St. Petersburg and Naples The Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg (pictured center) will transform the city's skyline and is anticipated to usher in a new wave of luxury development downtown In many respects, Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg is surfing a wave that’s been breaking for years. The branded residential real estate space has been on a tear since well before the pandemic, outpacing the wider housing market by almost every metric and fueling a free-for-all of new entrants and partnerships both in South Florida and around the world. The forces and factors driving the sector — 5-star service, brand loyalty, and higher re-sale value, among others — have been exhaustively covered in dozens of articles, mine included, so I don’t need to undress them further here. What’s noticeably different this time around, though, is the place on the Monopoly board Shear and PMG are putting new foundations in the ground. Historically most high-profile brands that have waded into the fray — among them early pioneers like Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons and, more recently, Nobu, Aston Martin, and Armani — have tended to cluster in glitzy, global metropolises where real estate values already are sky high and the world’s 1% like to throw their money around, such as Manhattan, Miami, and Dubai. They also tend to congregate in exclusive resort destinations in Los Cabos, the Yucatan, and the Caribbean. A dining room rendering at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg Every residence at the Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg has its own private foyer That makes the prospect of a Waldorf Astoria tower in downtown St. Petersburg an outlier on the trend line which, in turn, portends a potentially significant shift in how the luxury branded residence game is played. If Florida’s central Gulf Coast — traditionally a magnet for Midwestern retirees and spring break beach benders — is worthy of world-class architecture and a high-society brand like Waldorf Astoria, who’s to say Raleigh-Durham and Colorado Springs aren’t next? The reality is more complicated. Notwithstanding its fixed, physical form, real estate is innately fluid, albeit on a relatively more molten scale. Tastes change. Buildings decay. Neighborhoods evolve. Consequently, up-and-coming locations that simmered with possibility two decades ago might very well be tapped out today (think Fort Lauderdale). Similarly, cities and commercial corridors currently deemed ‘second tier’ or not befitting a Fendi, Cipriani, or comparably premium brand could be the next Nashville or Park Slope hiding in plain sight. St. Petersburg, Florida is often ranked one of America's best places to live and retire due to its affordability, safety, and healthy quality of life St. Petersburg Beach and Clearwater Beach are two of the state's most stunning stretches of Gulf Coast By this measure, St. Petersburg is definitely having its ‘moment’ — along with the rest of the greater Tampa Bay region for that matter. The drivers behind the boom are the usual Florida suspects: warm weather, low taxes, a healthy lifestyle, strong job growth, and a blossoming entrepreneurial scene thanks to a widespread in-migration of talent during the pandemic. Yet, what’s currently happening in St. Petersburg is also part of a longer-term demographic shift. Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties on the state’s Atlantic Coast have finally begun to spill over, and savvy investors and wealthy buyers now priced out of traditionally tony waterfront enclaves like Bal Harbor, Surfside, Jupiter, and SoFi (‘South of Fifth’) in Miami Beach are taking their money — and Florida’s center of affluence — westward. “Florida’s Gulf coast is among the most under-valued real estate markets in the country,” Shear tells me, “Especially compared with cities like Miami and West Palm Beach. St. Pete is a hidden gem that’s been under the radar for a very long time and it’s just beginning to come into its own. The city is also becoming a magnet for high net-worth individuals thanks to its vibrant cultural scene, stunning waterfront, and exceptional quality of life.” Th architecturally iconic Salvador Dali Museum houses the largest collection of work by the famed artist outside of Europe An aerial perspective of St. Petersburg. Tropicana Field in the foreground is the home of MLB's Tampa Bay Rays For the locals and snowbirds who discovered St. Petersburg long before Wall Street and Big Tech did, none of the current praise-heaping comes as a surprise. The city often rates as one of America’s best places to live and retire on account of its affordability, walkability, beach access, up-and-coming culinary scene, and world-renowned art museums, galleries, and performance venues, including the Salvador Dalí Museum as well as the Chiluly Collection at the Morean Arts Center. Socially and economically, St. Pete is also safe and inclusive and boasts a diversified economy with industries like healthcare and technology playing a significant role in the city’s sustainable growth in addition to tourism. In a recent study by WalletHub ranking the “Best-& Worst-Run Cities in America”, St. Pete ranked #1 in Florida overall. Nationally, the city’s economy ranked second, ahead of Atlanta, Charlotte, and Austin (by comparison, Miami came in #62, Fort Lauderdale #121). St. Petersburg Pier is one of the city's most popular tourist attractions Old Southeast is one of St. Petersburg's most historic downtown neighborhoods Sunshine Skyway Bridge connects St. Petersburg to Tampa Bay “St. Pete has arrived,” says Larry Feldman, CEO of Feldman Equities which is co-developing the Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg with PMG. “Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed the city’s incredible rise. And the introduction of the Waldorf Astoria brand is testament to this extensive growth and the natural progression St. Pete has undergone. We’re eager to deliver a branded residential development that meets the elevated caliber of living the city’s new residents desire, and I can’t wait to see all of the opportunities and incredible experiences this project will contribute to the downtown area.” The Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg will add a striking new silhouette to the city's waterfront skyline Beach Drive in downtown St Petersburg is one of the city's primary thoroughfares On this last point, Feldman made me realize something else the Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg says about the current state of the branded residential real estate space: that it’s actually quite symbiotic. For Feldman, Shear, PMG, and Waldorf Astoria, St. Pete offers a rare opportunity: a lead position in an A-series funding round if Facebook were luxury real estate. In return, St. Pete gains global credibility virtually overnight thanks to Waldorf’s ‘legitimatizing’ effect on the city’s stature and prestige, much the same way a James Beard Award-winning chef opening up a new restaurant in a neighborhood that’s revitalizing is usually a sure sign it’s “arrived” As a result, the value of Waldorf Astoria coming to St. Petersburg is far from simply architectural or temporarily economic in terms of job creation and investment. The original Waldorf hotel on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan hosted diplomats and distinguished foreign visitors and catered to the needs of New York’s socially prominent, “upper crust". The Waldorf brand was also renowned for setting the original standards for luxury and indulgence in hospitality, including becoming the first hotel in the world to offer electricity and private bathrooms in every room. “A project of this scale and caliber with a globally revered 5-star brand like the Waldorf Astoria attached has a profound, legitimizing effect on a city like St. Petersburg,” explains Shear. “It serves as a powerful signal that the city is not just on the rise, but poised for its next chapter of growth and transformation. St. Pete is a major luxury market that deserves to carry on the Waldorf legacy, and this project will help the city gain global recognition, bring long-term development benefits, and I’m confident that other 5-star brands will follow suit.” Clearwater Beach Pier Kiteboarding on Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg captures the essence of the region's healthy, active, outdoor lifestyle The Museum of Fine Arts in downtown St. Petersburg is one of many nationally and world-renowned arts and cultural institutions in the city Another powerful side effect of a high-profile branded residential real estate project coming to a city like St. Petersburg is its ‘globalizing’ effect, especially when an internationally recognized brand like Waldorf Astoria is involved. Shear anticipates that at least 30% of his buyers will come from Europe and Latin America, most of whom will reside in St. Pete part of the year and all of whom regard their purchases as a long-term financial investment (the other 70% will come from the Midwest and Northeast). “We’re all selling sunshine and low taxes in Florida,” Shear says, “But along the West Coast in areas like Tampa and St. Petersburg specifically, premium real estate remains resilient, driven by sustained demand from both domestic and international high net-worth individuals who view the current market conditions as an opportunity to invest in tangible U.S. assets like real estate, which has long been a cornerstone of long-term wealth building. But unlike other investments, real estate offers the added benefit of personal enjoyment and use, delivering value beyond just financial returns especially when you consider that you’re living in a 5-star hotel.” The Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg will be the tallest building in the city once it's completed offering endless horizon views from every residence No luxury or amenity is spared at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg, in keeping with the original legacy of the brand Custom made Italian vanities are one of many lavish fixtures and furnishings that are featured in the residences To merge Waldorf Astoria’s rich legacy with St. Pete’s unique history, character, and charm, PMG has tapped CUBE 3 for the tower architecture with interiors curated by the award-winning design firm BAMO. The high rise’s fully finished two- and three-bedroom residences will range from 2,031 square feet to 3,408 square feet and feature private foyers, custom closets, Italian vanities, chef’s kitchens, and expansive terraces with Tampa Bay views along with finishes, furnishings, and appliances befitting the Waldorf reputation for unparalleled décor and design. The tower’s top two-stories will be combined into the penthouse residence that will encompass 10,000 square feet overall with a private pool. On the amenities side, a 20,000-square-foot, resort-style pool deck will feature a 160-foot east pool with Bay views, a sunset pool with dual spas, elegant lounge areas, and a bar, while the Amenity Suite on Level 18 offers a thoughtfully curated wellness center prioritizing holistic healing and connection with nature. Spaces in the center will include private massage rooms, his and her saunas and steam rooms, as well as a state-of-the-art fitness center and movement studio. On Level 46, residents will have exclusive access to the legendary Peacock Alley-inspired Sky Lounge, a signature space that captures the legacy, elegance, and sophistication of the Waldorf Astoria brand. The end of another perfect day at St. Pete Beach As for the next evolution in the luxury branded residence space? Shear remains bullish on the niche market as well as the long-term drivers underpinning it. “We never really know until we launch a new project, but we feel strongly that there is real depth for branded real estate developments not just in cities like Miami, but in cities like St. Petersburg too,” he says. “All indications are that there continues to be strong demand not only for seasoned, well-capitalized developers who deliver on time, but also for 5-star brands like Waldorf Astoria that offer buyers peace of mind, an exceptional quality of life, and design, quality, and craftsmanship that are second to none.” If Shear’s instincts are right — which, based on PMG’s track record, they usually are — St. Petersburg and the wider Tampa Bay region, including Sarasota and Bradenton, are just getting started. Residences at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg start in the mid-$2m.

Title: Tariff Meltdown! Job Cuts! Empty Ports! Temu Customers Freaking Out!

Tomorrow will be four weeks since Trump announced America’s LIBERATION DAY (from its wallets) with the biggest tariffs ever, now 145 percent tariffs on imports from China and a 10 percent minimum tax on all other countries. Has the phone from China rung yet with them begging with tears in their eyes to make a deal? I’m sure they’ll be calling any minute! Right after they get off the phone with Brazil to order up all of their soybeans. Contrary to what Trump told The Atlantic, he does not run the world. And like Wile E. Coyote off a cliff, we’re going down and have not quite reckoned with it or how bad it’s going to be, though pandemic-hardened consumers are stocking up, and purchases of canned goods, ketchup and instant coffee are up double digits. Subscribe But don’t you dare blame Donald J. Trump for the price hikes and empty shelves to come, ooh, that makes him mad! EARLIER TODAY! After Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was considering adding a line item to orders imported from other countries, so consumers could see exactly how much these tariffs are fucking them over, a “pissed off” Trump freaked out and rang up Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. And The Beez immediately caved, even though Trump’s tariffs and the resulting stock market fuckery have already cost Bezos $109 million today, and about $68 billion since “Liberation Day.” But not supporting a candidate-lady who laughed, that is priceless. “Of course [Trump] was pissed,” an anonymous White House source told CNN. “Why should a multibillion dollar company pass off costs to consumers?” Because that is what a price is? BUT STOP TARIFFING YOURSELF, JEFF! And then Karoline Leavitt fumed about it, because fuming is her only emotion. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon. Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Then she accused Amazon of being partnered with a “Chinese propaganda arm.” Eesh, why did Trump take a million dollars from him for that “inauguration” fund, then? The guy should really be more thoughtful about who he hangs out with! And hold up, is she admitting that tariffs make things more expensive?! One company that is adding a tariff line item, Temu. The “Temu Things” subreddit is in full meltdown with consumers pointing out a line with massive “import charges” on their invoices. Getting rid of the de minimis tariff exemption for packages under $800 is going to have another side effect too; somebody’s got to collect all of those tariffs on polyester shirts and whatnot, and inspect packages to make sure nobody’s claiming their shirt is a shawl from grandma, or something. Are the ports staffed with enough Customs workers to take that on, or is everybody’s package just going to get stuck there for months? We shall see! Meanwhile, it seems like empty shelves are going to be a future reality. At the Port of Los Angeles, the main point of entry for cargo ships from China and Southeast Asia, the executive director says shipments are expected to sink 35 percent next week. In Washington state, the Northwest Seaport Alliance saw an increase in March as retailers stocked up in anticipation, and now ships are coming in with 30 percent less cargo. And ships are going out and turning around and coming back, then just sitting in dock waiting with their soybeans or whatever, because orders are being cancelled. And now UPS says it will cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities in expectation that Amazon shipments will be cut in half. Trucking volumes are already down, and Mack Trucks and Volvo Trucks are laying off hundreds of workers. Outlook not good for the stevedores, either, with all those cargo ships buying one-way tickets to Palookaville! Trump bragged to Time Magazine that he has made “200 deals,” SECRET deals, MANY deals, and he’ll tell everybody about them soon, though, and Peter Navarro said there would be 90 deals in 90 days. But here we are at day 27, still nobody is saying with whom these big beautiful deals were made! If China is talking to anybody (and they say they’re not), it’s not buffoon Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. But “uh, maybe they’ll call me one day,” he told Fox News. Sure they will. Maybe Beyonce will, too! And he just knows they’ll come crawling back real soon, because we buy “five times more” stuff from them than they buy from us. Is he sure we don’t need some of that stuff though? The US relies on China for as much as 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients and 90 percent of generic antibiotics. And more than 90 percent of the medical gear worn by American health care workers. Guess it’s back to those pandemic garbage-bag outfits! And now with the uncertainty, PPE manufacturers and drug companies like Pfizer say they will not invest in research and development in the US, and can’t really blame them. Earlier today That Man did back down from part of his automotive tariffs, so that car importers already paying a tariff on the car will now not ALSO be paying a tariff on the steel and aluminum, and can get a rebate for any double-tariffs they paid. So benevolent, and how well-thought-out this rollout was! Meanwhile, Rand Paul and the Democrats are expected to vote this week on revoking Trump’s self-bestowed emergency tariff powers. Trump will just veto it, of course, but as layoffs, empty shelves, and furious constituents pile up, maybe two-thirds of the House and Senate will grow some spines and override him? (Why you need two-thirds to override a presidential veto of Congress vetoing the president seizing Congress’s specifically enumerated taxing power is just one of those funny things!) We can dream! Now if you’ll excuse us, we are off to order 10 tubes of Japanese sunscreen and several restaurant-sized jars of Lao Gan Ma chili crisp, and maybe some K95 masks for the plague to come, and re-watch On The Waterfront.

Title: Orion Group Holdings Reports First Quarter 2025 Results

April 29, 2025 16:19 ET | Source: Orion Group Holdings, Inc. Orion Group Holdings, Inc. HOUSTON, April 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orion Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ORN) (the “Company”), a leading specialty construction company, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025. Highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2025: See definitions and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures elsewhere in this release. Management Commentary “We’re off to a strong start in 2025. On a year-over-year basis, our first quarter revenue increased 17% to $189 million and Adjusted EBITDA doubled. This performance reflects the strength of our operating model and the successful execution of our strategic priorities,” said Travis Boone, Chief Executive Officer of Orion Group Holdings. “By consistently delivering top-tier work and prioritizing safety, we have enhanced our current customer relationships while developing new ones. Year-to-date, we have secured $349 million in new contract awards--$161 million in Marine and $188 million in Concrete, which have started or are scheduled to start within the next few months. We continue to see strong demand across our markets and continue to win repeat business with our world-class partners and clients.” “The future for Orion is extremely bright and our business and operating model is well positioned for this moment. We believe that many of the new federal policy initiatives will support our long-term growth, especially around defense, shipbuilding, infrastructure, and reshoring of manufacturing. Regardless of the efforts to reduce federal spending, we are seeing no impact on domestic infrastructure projects that we are delivering or pursuing, and there has been no pull back on the U.S. government’s China deterrence policy.” “Regarding tariffs, we have been proactively managing tariff risk since last summer and do not expect material impacts to our current projects. Nor do we believe that any actions taken to downsize the federal government will have a material bearing on our business. Therefore, we are reiterating our previous full year 2025 guidance of revenue in the range of $800 million to $850 million with Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $42 million to $46 million. At the same time, we are continuing to prepare for transformational growth in 2026 and beyond,” concluded Boone. First Quarter 2025 Results Contract revenues of $188.7 million increased $28.0 million or 17.4% from $160.7 million in the first quarter last year, primarily due to an increase in revenue from large marine construction contracts and new concrete projects. Gross profit increased to $23.0 million or 12.2% of revenue, up from $15.5 million or 9.7% of revenue in the first quarter of 2024. The increases in gross profit dollars and margin were primarily driven by an improvement in indirect expenses in the marine segment as a result of a higher volume of work, partially offset by lower margins in the concrete segment which were primarily driven by seasonally lower productivity, which is normal for the first quarter. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $22.5 million, up from $19.0 million in the first quarter of 2024. As a percentage of total contract revenues, SG&A expenses increased to 12.0% from 11.8%. The increases in SG&A dollars and percentage reflect an increase in incentive compensation, legal, IT and operating lease expenses. GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $1.4 million ($0.04 per diluted share) compared to a net loss of $6.1 million ($0.19 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter 2025 net loss included $1.7 million ($0.05 diluted income per share) of non-recurring items. First quarter 2025 adjusted net income was $0.3 million ($0.01 diluted income per share). EBITDA for the first quarter of 2025 was $6.3 million, resulting in a 3.3% EBITDA margin, compared to EBITDA of $3.0 million, and a 1.8% EBITDA margin for the first quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased to $8.2 million, or a 4.3% Adjusted EBITDA margin. This compares to Adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 million, or a 2.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin for the prior year period. Backlog Total backlog at March 31, 2025 was $839.7 million, compared to $729.1 million at December 31, 2024 and $756.6 million at March 31, 2024. Backlog for the Marine segment was $607.4 million at March 31, 2025, compared to $582.8 million at December 31, 2024 and $569.9 million at March 31, 2024. Backlog for the Concrete segment was $232.3 million at March 31, 2025, compared to $146.3 million at December 31, 2024 and $186.7 million at March 31, 2024. Recent Contract Wins Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company has been awarded $51.2 million in new contract wins - $17.1 million in Marine and $34.1 million in Concrete. The Marine wins include a $6.3 million environmental project for General Recycling of Washington and a $7.5 million dredging project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Galveston District. In Concrete, wins include a $24.1 million project for Phase 2 of the Costco distribution center in Florida, and a $6.6 million project for a United Airlines catering facility at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Balance Sheet Update As of March 31, 2025, current assets were $267.0 million, including unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $13.0 million. Total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2025 was $23.3 million. At the end of the quarter, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

Backlog Definition Backlog consists of projects under contract that have either (a) not been started, or (b) are in progress but are not yet complete. The Company cannot guarantee that the revenue implied by its backlog will be realized, or, if realized, will result in earnings. Backlog can fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and execution of contracts. The typical duration of the Company’s projects ranges from three to nine months on shorter projects to multiple years on larger projects. The Company's backlog at any point in time includes both revenue it expects to realize during the next twelve-month period as well as revenue it expects to realize in future years. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes the financial measures “adjusted net income/loss,” “adjusted earnings/loss per share,” “EBITDA,” "Adjusted EBITDA" and “Adjusted EBITDA margin." These measurements are “non-GAAP financial measures” under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Regulation G. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies that use similarly titled measures. By reporting such non-GAAP financial information, the Company does not intend to give such information greater prominence than comparable GAAP financial information. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to and not in substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted earnings/loss per share should not be viewed as an equivalent financial measure to net income/loss or earnings/loss per share. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted earnings/loss per share exclude certain items that management believes are one-time items or items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company believes these adjusted financial measures are a useful supplement to earnings/loss calculated in accordance with GAAP. Orion Group Holdings defines EBITDA as net income/loss before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBITDA for certain items that management believes are one-time items or items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for the period by contract revenues for the period. The GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income, while the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA margin is operating margin, which represents operating income divided by contract revenues. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used internally to evaluate current operating expense, operating efficiency, and operating profitability on a variable cost basis, by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, and net interest and tax expenses. Additionally, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information regarding the Company's ability to meet future debt service and working capital requirements while providing an overall evaluation of the Company's financial condition. In addition, EBITDA is used internally for incentive compensation purposes. The Company includes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to provide transparency to investors as they are commonly used by investors and others in assessing performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have certain limitations as analytical tools and should not be used as a substitute for operating margin, net income, cash flows, or other data prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity. Forward-Looking Statements The matters discussed in this press release may constitute or include projections or other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of which provisions the Company is availing itself.

Title: 100 days in, these are the 3 ways the Trump trade fell apart
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-war-first-100-days-tariffs-us-china-recession-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-29T19:47:53Z
Full Content:
Money managers came into President Donald Trump's second term on the promise of tax cuts, DOGE savings, and pro-growth policies that would juice the stock market. Many viewed tariffs as an afterthought. "This might cause some market volatility, but we don't think it will derail US growth," Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for UBS Global Wealth Management, said of Trump's tariff plans at a conference in November last year. "Let's not forget that during his first term, president-elect Trump was quite responsive to market reactions." One hundred days after Trump's inauguration, the S&P 500 is down 10% from record highs, banks across Wall Street have raised recession odds, and investor sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. How did it all go so wrong? Here are the three lessons Wall Street has learned the hard way over the last 100 days. Wall Street got the biggest piece of the Trump agenda wrong: tariffs. Trump's approach during his first term might have given investors a false sense of confidence and predictability. "In his first term, he gave you all the good stuff first. He gave you the tax cuts, he started deregulating, and then he started focusing on the tariffs, and I think a lot of people expected that to happen again," James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, told Business Insider. Instead, investors were slammed with executive orders levying tariffs from the start. The final extent of Trump's tariffs still remains to be seen as the president negotiates with other countries during the 90-day pause, but investors are no longer brushing off tariff concerns as an empty threat. Some strategists remain optimistic. Jeff Schulze, the head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, was surprised by the magnitude of the president's tariff policy. However, in a recent Franklin Templeton podcast, Schulze compared tariffs to the "spinach portion of the administration's dinner" — a necessary evil preceding "the dessert portion, which is deregulation and tax cuts." Others are mapping out a worst-case scenario. Torsten Slok, Apollo's chief economist, believes that a tariff-induced recession could begin materializing by May as shipping traffic to the US slows to a halt. Investors initially believed Trump's tariff rhetoric would be checked by his desire to encourage growth in the stock market, meaning he wouldn't do anything crazy enough to spook equities. Now, it's a different story. Trump's proven that he's willing to let stocks plummet — but he draws the line at rising yields in the bond market. Twice now, Trump has walked back some of his more extreme policies after a spike in Treasury yields — once after his Liberation Day tariffs, and again after he threatened to fire Jerome Powell. "The focus is now really on the bond market, and he's willing to accept more pain and volatility in the short term on the equity side as long as the 10-year doesn't start to creep back higher toward 5% again," Jonathan Curtis, chief investment officer of the Franklin Equity Group, said. "His tolerance for pain in the equity markets is particularly high." Why is the 10-year US Treasury yield coming into focus as the trade war rages on? Foreign buyers of US debt might be less inclined to continue holding US bonds if their countries are slapped with heavy tariffs, which means the US will have to offer higher yields to entice buyers, St. Aubin said. That's the opposite of what Trump, who's prioritizing lowering interest rates, wants. A lower 10-year Treasury yield will stimulate the economy by bringing down mortgage rates, business loan costs, and the price of financing government debt, Curtis and St. Aubin said. With the Magnificent Seven carrying the S&P 500 throughout 2023 and 2024, it seemed reasonable to assume that Trump's pro-business stance would keep the Big Tech rally going. But investors failed to consider the extent to which tariffs would severely damper almost every aspect of the market. As trade relations worsen, America's AI darlings — or any large American company for that matter — are at risk of being targeted by countries unhappy about tariffs, according to St. Aubin. If Trump makes it harder for imports to enter the US, foreign countries might push back with retaliatory tariffs and stop buying American goods as well. For example, Tesla is seeing plunging sales in China as local companies like BYD snatch up market share. Another large concern for the Magnificent Seven firms has been how globally integrated their supply chains are for their tech products. But on top of the trade war, growing competition in the AI space has called into question the swaths of cash these companies have thrown at building out the technology. The Trump-driven market chaos is confounding, considering tech CEOs and billionaires curried favor with the president leading up to the inauguration, Curtis said, only to see their company stock prices plummet since then. "We saw a number of the tech leaders show up on Inauguration Day, and so it has been with some surprise that things have gone the way they have gone, particularly around the tariffs and even with some of the legal cases that are continuing forward with Meta and Google," Curtis said.

The U.S. is currently the world leader in artificial intelligence, but new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump could threaten that leadership. Earlier this spring, the president introduced sweeping new import tariffs from key trading partners. The goal is to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and protect American jobs. However, its adverse effects are already being felt in the tech sector, which is worrying. According to analysts, one industry —artificial intelligence— might potentially take the harshest blow.

You can opt out anytime. A.I. companies have yet to determine if Trump tariffs are about to decimate them, and the fact that no one has a clear answer is sending the tech industry into confusion. The key issue is whether GPUs, the graphics processing units, essential to A.I., computing and many other sectors, will be exempted from Trump’s sweeping tariffs. The A.I. industry’s infrastructure depends on a hyper-global supply chain—chips, cooling systems and servers—nearly every component coming from overseas. Now, thanks to tariffs as high as 32 percent on Taiwanese imports, building A.I. in the U.S. could become drastically more expensive. The tech markets have already flinched hard. Nvidia (NVDA), TSMC and the Magnificent Seven also faced decline following the announcement. The message from Wall Street is clear: these tariffs, even temporary, are a direct threat to the A.I. sector. Even as the stock market tumbles and companies scramble for clarity, the real question remains: Are these tariffs truly protecting American industries, or are they hurting the innovation that drives them? It doesn’t help that the administration has done almost nothing to clarify its intent. Chips imported as standalone components may be safe, but most don’t arrive that way. They come embedded in servers, which are fairly in tariffs’ crosshairs. A single A.I. GPU costs tens of thousands of dollars, and A.I. labs need thousands. Slapping a 30 percent tariff on those machines is a costly bet. AllianceBernstein analysts also voiced similar concerns. There’s open speculation inside tech companies that Trump will offer exemptions to companies he favors, just like he did for Apple in his first term. But that’s not policy. That’s patronage. The broader economic effects could be devastating. The tariffs affect A.I. infrastructure, raw materials, cooling systems, construction supplies and even rare earth materials. A.I. companies are already mulling whether it might be cheaper to build data centers abroad. A.I. data centers, powering everything from ChatGPT to Meta’s new Llama models, are hugely expensive to build. With tariffs slapped on top, the cost of building those data centers in the U.S. could rise so fast that companies might have to build them elsewhere. Some already are. So let’s get this straight: In the name of “America First,” Trump is pushing a narrative that it’s cheaper to build the future of A.I. outside the U.S. The irony here is painful. These tariffs were meant to protect American technological leadership. Instead, they push the next-generation A.I. breakthrough overseas, just as China doubles down on its domestic compute investments. While A.I. chips imported as standalone products are largely exempt, many servers and essential datacenter components will face higher tariffs that could increase the cost of building A.I. infrastructure. According to CBRE estimates, the object tariffs will boost construction costs for commercial projects—including A.I. data centers—by 3 to 5 percent as higher steel, aluminum and copper prices feed directly into building budgets. If an electronics exemption on Chinese imports is rolled back, data-center equipment currently duty-free could face a 145 percent tariff. This would more than double the cost of servers, storage arrays and ancillary hardware procured from China. So, U.S. tariffs could raise A.I. development costs by hundreds of millions. This is not a soft threat. It signals a heightened risk that could break supply chains powering A.I. innovation across the next two years. Semiconductor policy now collides directly with America’s A.I. momentum. The problem is not tariffs alone. It is a mix of capital cost spikes, talent shortages, regulatory fog and hardware bottlenecks. Without decisive action, Washington’s A.I. strategy is at risk, and Washington might fall behind its global competitors within the next 12 to 18 months. Tariffs are only one layer of policy risk. Export controls, investment restrictions and the possibility of counter-retaliation by trading partners add to the instability. Large-scale A.I. infrastructure is capital-intensive. Training a frontier A.I. model today can cost upwards of $100 million. Data centers require billions in investment to meet demand. Tariff-driven hardware inflation raises the total project cost. Microsoft (MSFT) has already shelved two gigawatts of new data centers, while Amazon (AMZN) has delayed key lease deals. Of course, there’s still a chance the administration walks this back—or at least sacrifices the rules. But even if an exemption comes through, the damage has been done. Companies are now factoring Trump’s unpredictability into their long-term decisions. The smart money will go where policy is stable and costs are clear. Artificial intelligence is too important to America’s economy and national security to be jerked around by tariff roulette. If the U.S. wants to stay ahead, it needs smart, forward-looking industrial policy—not slogans, not guesswork. And let’s not forget: China is watching. While the U.S. is busy sabotaging its own A.I. momentum, China is investing, scaling and integrating artificial intelligence into every facet of its economy. The current issue is more than just a trade dispute—it’s about the future of U.S. technology. These tariffs aren’t merely a tax on foreign goods; they are a tax on the future of the U.S. tech sector. If the U.S. wants to remain competitive, it must rethink its approach to global trade. Tariffs are not a solution; policies that support growth are.

Title: The Next Wealth Revolution: How Circular Business Models Are Redefining Growth
URL: https://observer.com/2025/04/circular-economy-business-strategy/
Time Published: 2025-04-29T18:30:59Z
Full Content:
For much of the industrial era, the global economy has operated on a deceptively simple model: extract resources, produce goods and dispose of the rest. This linear system, known as “take-make-waste,” thrived under the illusion that resources were abundant, cheap and endlessly available. That era is over. The numbers are striking: global annual material consumption surpassed 100 billion tons in 2023, yet only 7.2 percent of that is cycled back into the economy. Municipal solid waste is projected to nearly double to 3.8 billion tons by 2050. This inefficiency isn’t just an environmental crisis; it’s a market failure. But within that failure lies a historic opportunity. Circular business models, which design out waste and keep materials in use, are emerging as the next great engine of value creation. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Volatility in commodity markets is making it harder to rely on linear supply chains. Lithium prices, for example, rose by more than 1,000 percent between 2020 and late 2022, before dropping 86 percent as oversupply hit the market. That level of price fluctuation creates serious challenges for companies dependent on raw materials. It’s prompting a strategic rethink: increasingly, businesses are turning to circular solutions like integrating battery recycling directly into manufacturing operations. What was once viewed as waste is now considered a valuable, underutilized resource. In 2015, Accenture estimated that circular business models could generate up to $4.5 trillion in additional economic output by 2030. That forecast is proving increasingly realistic. Recycling aluminum, for example, requires 95 percent less energy than producing it from raw materials, and around 75 percent of all aluminum ever made is still in circulation. In manufacturing, remanufacturing components to original specifications can reduce production costs by 40 to 60 percent, lowering exposure to raw material volatility. The shift to circular models isn’t just about doing less harm—it’s unlocking real business potential. In consumer tech, Back Market has built one of the fastest-growing marketplaces for refurbished electronics, reaching a $5.7 billion valuation and reporting 45 percent revenue growth to €320 million ($363 million) in 2023. It’s now on track to profitability in Europe. In luxury fashion, Vestiaire Collective is proving that resale is far from niche, with €157 million ($178 million) in revenue and over €824 million ($936 million) in goods traded in 2023. Both are tapping into demand for high-quality, lower-impact alternatives—and showing how circular strategies can open new avenues for growth. The climate case for circularity is just as strong. According to Circle Economy’s 2024 report, nearly 40 percent of global emissions come from how we extract, use and dispose of materials. More than a supply chain issue, it’s a major driver of the climate crisis. Circular strategies, by keeping materials in use and cutting waste, can eliminate a significant share of those emissions. For companies looking to meet net-zero targets, circularity is fast becoming a core lever for decarbonization. Investors are increasingly recognizing the potential of the circular economy. In 2023, venture capital funding for circular economy startups reached approximately $8.7 billion. While this accounts for a small share of overall VC activity, the pace of growth signals rising interest in scalable, sustainability-driven innovation. Institutional investors are also entering the space; for instance, BlackRock (BLK) has launched a dedicated Global Circular Economy ETF to capitalize on this transition.​ Startup innovation is driving this momentum. U.S.-based Loop Industries is advancing depolymerization technology to recycle PET plastic at high quality, securing €20 million ($20.8 million) in December 2024 in strategic investment and licensing its technology in Europe. Similarly, Ecovative Design, a biomaterials company founded in 2007, has raised $155 million. Ecovative is commercializing mycelium-based alternatives to leather and packaging, demonstrating that bio-based circular materials can compete in food and fashion markets. All of this is further accelerated by geopolitics. The pandemic, war in Ukraine and surging trade tensions have exposed the fragility of global supply chains. Companies now recognize that resource resilience is a core business concern. Circular business models—such as localized remanufacturing, material recovery and reverse logistics—help reduce dependence on volatile imports and create more stable, regional value loops. In response, major players are acting. Apple (AAPL) has committed to using 100 percent recycled cobalt in batteries by 2025. IKEA is rolling out resale programs for furniture and investing in circular design. Michelin has shifted to a tire-as-a-service model for fleet clients—optimizing usage, extending product life and creating long-term customer relationships. Caterpillar’s remanufacturing division has proven that reusing components not only reduces waste, but also increases margin and customer retention. These examples aren’t exceptions, they’re early indicators of where the market is heading. They prove that the business case is no longer theoretical, and that the environmental impact case and business case can go hand in hand. Still, transitioning to circularity requires intent, strategic foresight and ultimately also investments. Crucially, it also calls for thinking and acting in ecosystems—where no company operates in isolation—and leveraging the power of evolving digital technologies to track, trace and optimize circular flows. It means rethinking product design, developing take-back systems, forming cross-industry collaborations and embedding lifecycle thinking into strategy. The payoff is compelling: lower risk, greater efficiency, stronger brand equity and real climate impact. For leaders, the question is not whether circularity matters, but whether your organization is ready to compete in a world that demands it. The companies that succeed in the next decade will create more value from fewer resources, deliver services over volume and turn yesterday’s waste into tomorrow’s growth. As we look ahead, it’s clear that the circular economy is a wealth creation engine. Those who innovate and invest now will define the next era of market leadership.

Title: UPS is cutting 20,000 jobs. It’s not what you think | CNN Business

Time Published: 2025-04-29T18:19:31Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: UPS will cut 20,000 jobs this year, about 4% of its global workforce, the company said Tuesday. But UPS added the decision is unrelated to tariffs and is instead due to increased use of technology and a previously announced plan to trim its Amazon business. UPS in January announced a “glide down” plan to cut its business with Amazon, its largest customer, in half by the middle of 2026. UPS CEO Carol Tome said Tuesday that most of the Amazon business that it is giving up is “not profitable for us, nor a healthy fit for our network.” The UPS package volume from Amazon was already down 16% in the just-completed quarter, which was a bigger drop than UPS had forecast for the period. UPS said it will close 73 US buildings by the end of June as the next part of that “glide down” plan. UPS also said it expects to use more automation in its facilities, from sorting packages to label application to loading and unloading trucks, with 400 facilities becoming partly if not fully automated. “With this reconfiguration, we will also lessen our dependency on labor,” she said. The Teamsters union, which represents more than 300,000 UPS hourly workers, said it would fight layoffs of any of its members. “If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won’t stand in its way,” said the union’s president, Sean O’Brien. “But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.” In response, UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the company intends to live up to all the terms of its contract. UPS did see some effects from Trump’s broad tariffs of 10% on most imports, though, especially the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports. But the company is still uncertain about the ultimate effects. Tome said customers that do a lot of business with China are “not thinking about exiting the business.” But she also said that many of them don’t know exactly what their next step will be. Many are still hoping for a tariff roll-back. “Candidly, there’s so much uncertainty around the China orders,” she said. “We know what’s been announced. We don’t know actually if it will happen, and we don’t know if it will stick. We think there are many things we don’t know.” UPS does believe its customers will feel an impact from the tariffs, and because of that, and the pull-back from Amazon, it forecast its own revenue will fall in the second quarter compared to a year ago. But it said it is not ready to drop its own full-year guidance, although it warned it could adjust that in the future as well. “There’s so much uncertainty in the back half (of the year), because all those (tariffs) will ultimately impact the US consumer,” she said. “Current consumer sentiment is down from where it was at the beginning of the year. (But) the consumer is still pretty healthy.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta launched a standalone artificial intelligence app Tuesday, putting it in direct competition with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and marking the latest app to release as part of the larger AI race. Meta announced the app Tuesday. (Photo by DREW ANGERER/AFP via Getty Images) Meta announced the launch of the app, which features an AI chatbot and a “discover” feed that allows users to see how others are using the assistant. The app uses Meta’s Llama 4 model, which was released early this month and has been touted by Meta as being more cost-efficient than competitor models like Gemini, GPT and DeepSeek. Meta’s AI assistant could already be used on WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here. The app gives users access to image generation, image editing and a voice mode that can be interacted with while using other apps on a device. The AI chatbot can answer questions using the web and use information users have shared on Meta products such as their Facebook profiles or the content they like on the social media app. Those who link their Facebook and Instagram profiles to their account center can create a more personalized experience when interacting with the Meta AI app. Users with Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to interact with Meta AI on the glasses and the app, enabling them to begin conversations through the eyewear and resume them through the app. The Meta AI app also features a voice assistant demo that provides more conversational responses, though it does not have access to the internet or real-time information. Meta’s stock was up a little over 1% as of 2 p.m. EDT ( $555.30), continuing a rise following its lowest point of the year on April 21. Shares of the tech giant are down 7.3% in 2025. OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google (Gemini), Microsoft (Copilot) and Anthropic (Claude) all have AI Apps. Elon Musk’s xAI launched a standalone app for its Grok chatbot in January. Similar to how Meta’s AI was once exclusively on the company’s social media apps, Grok was previously limited to X, formerly known as Twitter. “With a user base spanning billions, Meta has access to rich and diverse data, meaning it can train highly optimized models across a unique data set,” Kyle Hill, chief technology officer of business technology firm ANS, told Forbes, adding, “Meta has an opportunity to stand out from the crowd, but it needs to figure out what its killer differentiator is.” Though Meta is late to launching its standalone app when compared to competitors, it has featured its AI assistant across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp since 2023, allowing its AI models to be trained with more content. Meta’s AI assistant garnered nearly 600 million monthly users as of December, according to Meta. One of the company’s AI competitors, OpenAI, told CNBC in February it was hosting 400 million weekly active users. While not having Meta’s advantage of offering its AI through social media apps, OpenAI has generated historic funding in its quest to lead the AI race. In March, OpenAI closed a $40 billion funding round, valuing the company at $300 billion and marking the biggest private tech funding round ever. Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok is backed by Musk, the world’s richest person, and the company’s supercomputer site in Memphis, Tenn., that is capable of training AI models at exceptional speeds.

Title: Karoline Leavitt’s Angry New Attack on Amazon Reveals Trump’s Weakness
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/194561/trump-angry-attack-amazon-tariffs
Time Published: 2025-04-29T18:14:10Z
Full Content:
Well, that was fast. On Tuesday morning—after the news broke that Amazon was supposedly planning to display the costs that President Trump’s tariffs are adding to the price of products—White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a dark warning. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” Leavitt told reporters, pointedly noting that she had just heard this message straight from the Big Man himself. Less than two hours later, Amazon put out a statement clarifying that this idea was only considered in a small corner of its sprawling online retail empire and “was never a consideration for the main Amazon site.” You might be tempted to see this as another sign of Trump’s fearsome strength: He merely hinted at unleashing the power of the government on Amazon, a company worth $2 trillion, and it immediately fell into line, right? Naah. This little saga is better seen as highly revealing of Trump’s weakness right now, both on tariffs specifically and more generally. The last thing that Trump and his propagandists can tolerate is the spectacle of voters being told basic facts about his tariffs. Which puts Trump at the mercy of those who will tell the truth about them. Leavitt’s broadside against Amazon is telling in this regard. First, watch the whole thing, courtesy of Aaron Rupar: REPORTER: Amazon will soon display a number next to the price of each product that shows how much the Trump tariffs are adding. Isn't that a perfect demonstration that it's the American consumer who is paying for these policies?LEAVITT: This is a hostile and political act by… pic.twitter.com/oewT08hBSH Note that Leavitt didn’t answer the second half of the reporter’s question. Isn’t the idea that Amazon might label the cost of tariffs, the reporter asked, a “crystal clear demonstration” that the American consumer, and not China, will have to “pay for these policies”? Leavitt unloaded aggressively in response, describing this as a “hostile” act, not once but twice—signaling that Trump would view this as meriting “hostile” action by the government in return. That may have gotten short-term results: Whatever Amazon’s original intentions, it did quickly announce a stand-down. But the careful observer will notice a problem with Leavitt’s approach. It’s that people are still going to have to pay higher prices for these tariffs on an enormous range of consumer products, whether Amazon labels them as such or not. And the ability of the White House to manage this problem—either by browbeating the private sector into not raising prices or by flooding Americans with propaganda about how “other countries” are the ones paying the tariffs in a much-needed global rebalancing—is actually quite limited. Recall that during a private call with the CEOs of big automakers last month, Trump darkly warned that they’d better not raise prices in response to his tariffs. The White House will look unfavorably on any companies that do this, he suggested, leaving them fearing retribution. Amusingly, all this really did was reveal that Trump himself knows that importers and domestic manufacturers using imported parts—and not “other countries”—are the ones who will pay the tariffs. Since then, there have been no indications that automakers will be bullied into swallowing the costs of Trump’s tariffs. Indeed, the White House just announced some tariff relief for them, an apparent backing down. Meanwhile, out in the real world, the impacts of Trump’s tariffs are already glaringly obvious. A dozen top retailers, including Shein and Target, announced just this week that Trump’s tariffs are translating into higher prices. Shipments to the port of Los Angeles are starting to dry up. Layoffs are beginning to hit, including deep in MAGA country. Trump’s spinners have boundless faith in their power to recast the battle over tariffs as one allying him with regular people against corporate elites. This was clearly the calculation behind the Trump-Leavitt effort to pick a public fight with Amazon over the possibility that the company might be too truthful with consumers about them. But the tariffs, as an issue, are uniquely positioned to cut through that kind of agitprop, and a new poll from CNN demonstrates why. It finds that a whopping 60 percent of Americans now say Trump’s policies have already increased the cost of living and 55 percent say his tariffs are “bad policy.” What’s remarkable, though, is that large percentages of working-class respondents also view the tariffs dimly. The numbers among non-college voters—a standard metric of class—are striking: 57 percent say Trump’s measures have already increased the cost of living; 50 percent say the tariffs are bad policy; 55 percent say he doesn’t have a clear strategy with them; 69 percent say they’ll hurt the economy in the short term; and 50 percent say they’ll hurt it over the long term. In short, Trump’s propagandists cannot easily polarize the tariffs along elite versus non-elite lines. And as that last data point suggests, there’s no sign that working-class voters see a need for the massive rebalancing—via an unwinding of globalization—that Trump keeps insisting we need. This is why you see opposition brewing even in deep-red places like Texas. People think Trump’s tariffs are bad, full stop, because they see it with their own eyes. And it isn’t just that they fear higher prices in the immediate term. It’s also that they view the superficial nationalist project underlying them dimly as well. So there’s an opening here for others to step into the breach that Amazon left by announcing it will not inform consumers about tariffs’ actual costs. Why can’t other retailers—ones large and small, ones not easily cowed by Trump—run with the idea? Why not do Amazon one better and explicitly label the additional costs heaped on consumer goods as the direct result of Trump’s tariffs? Slap his name right on those added costs, just as Trump put his name on those 2020 stimulus checks. OK, I get that this idea might run into some practical difficulties. Smaller retailers can’t inform all that many consumers with a move like this. But it’s the sort of thing that could generate a little cultural boomlet if it got going. It might spread. Companies that don’t fear MAGA boycotts—or want to bond with anti-Trump customer bases—might have a little fun and get creative. Just look how infuriated Trump grew at the prospect of one company—admittedly a giant and influential one, but still—telling consumers the truth about his policies. The wildly disproportionate response to Amazon from Trump and Leavitt wasn’t a sign of strength and power. It was a display of deep, enduring weakness, just waiting to be exploited.

Title: UPS layoffs: Package delivery company to cut 20,000 jobs, close 73 facilities as it reduces amount of Amazon shipments it handles

UPS is looking to slash about 20,000 jobs and close more than 70 facilities as it drastically reduces the amount of Amazon shipments it handles. The package delivery company said Tuesday that it anticipates making the job cuts this year. It anticipates closing 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June. UPS said that it is still reviewing its network and may identify more buildings to be shuttered. "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," CEO Carol Tomé said in a statement on Tuesday. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS." In January UPS announced that it had reached a deal with Amazon, its biggest customer, to lower its volume by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. During UPS' fourth-quarter earnings conference call in January, Tomé said that the company had partnered with Amazon for almost 30 years and that when its contract came up this year, UPS decided to reassess the relationship. "Amazon is our largest customer but it's not our most profitable customer," Tomé said at the time. "Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business." Tomé said that UPS considered various options and determined that the volume reduction was the best alternative. The company employs about 490,000 workers, according to FactSet. United Parcel Service Inc. also reported its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday. The Atlanta-based company earned $1.19 billion, or $$1.40 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Stripping out certain items, earnings were $1.49 per share. That's better than the $1.44 per share that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research were calling for. Revenue totaled $21.55 billion, beating Wall Street's estimate of $21.06 billion. UPS said that it wasn't providing any updates to its previously announced full-year outlook, given current macroeconomic uncertainty. The company previously said that it expected 2025 revenue of approximately $89 billion. Shares of UPS rose slightly in morning trading.

Title: Oxy Taps A.I. To Help Inject Old Oilfields With Carbon Dioxide

ByChristopher Helman ByChristopher Helman, Forbes Staff. Vicki Hollub ran operations in the Permian basin for Oxy before becoming CEO. She posed for Forbes in 2017. Occidental Petroleum’s conventional oilfields in the Permian basin of west Texas have been producing for decades. And although output has slowed, there remains 2 billion barrels of oil still trapped thousands of feet below the surface. Engineers have figured out several methods over the years to scour out stubborn oil from nooks and crannies in the reservoir rock (think of a sponge but with much tighter pore spaces). One involves strategically injecting water below the level of the oil in order to flush it out. After water, in some fields the engineers turn to injecting steam, which further softens up stubborn crude oil. For its old fields in the Permian, Oxy has big plans to deploy an even more effective solvent: carbon dioxide. Chief Executive Vicki Hollub — speaking last week at a conference organized by the Harold Hamm Institute for American Energy at Oklahoma State University in Oklahoma City — said that CO2 molecules have been proven to be considerably more effective than steam at scouring oil out of the rock. Especially compelling: the CO2 remains trapped in the rock, taking the place of the oil. Ironically, although carbon dioxide surrounds us, it’s hard to find it in concentrated form. Oxy for years has pumped CO2 out of the ground from naturally occurring reservoirs in Colorado and New Mexico, then sent it by pipeline to the Permian, where they then pressurize and inject the gas back down into old oilfields to goose out more crude. Recognizing that in the long run it’s probably better to leave the naturally occurring CO2 in the ground where they found it, Oxy a few years ago jumped on the concept of Direct Air Capture. After some $500 million invested (with BlackRock), this summer near Odessa, Texas, Oxy expects to start up its first plant to suck CO2 straight out of the air. Soon the company will sending this atmospheric greenhouse gas deep underground, both into oilfields as well as saline water reservoirs. Such techniques aren’t just nice to have, says Hollub, they are vital if the United States is to achieve and maintain anything close to the energy “dominance” promised by President Donald Trump. Without advanced recovery, said Hollub, Oxy won’t be able to tap 2 billion barrels of oil left in conventional fields in the Permian. America will need that oil. Hollub believes that the U.S. oil industry will hit peak production by the end of the decade. After that U.S. oil output will inexorably decline, she believes. Injecting CO2 into old oilfields could dramatically reduce that rate of decline. Hollub’s dream is ultimately to sequester more carbon into these layers of reservoir rock than is contained in the fossil fuels that Oxy produces from them — thereby enabling Oxy to market net-zero-carbon fuels. The first direct air capture plant under Oxy's Stratos project is nearing completion near Odessa. Oxy formed its carbon capture subsidiary 1Point5 and in 2023 acquired Canadian startup Carbon Engineering for its base tech, which uses potassium hydroxide to chemically react with CO2 and capture it from the air. Economically, Oxy happens to be the nation’s biggest maker of potassium hydroxide. This initial plant will make 250,000 tons per year of CO2, and Oxy is already leveraging iterative learnings to build a second plant for completion mid-2026. Engineers are using in-house artificial intelligence to build digital twins of these oilfields — feeding them millions of datapoints from thousands of sensors in order to design and simulate more effective strategies to help permanently inject the maximum amount of CO2 while extracting their more-sustainable petroleum. Hollub emphasized that this effort depends for its economic viability on the largesse of Uncle Sam. Federal law, as promulgated by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, currently provides for tax credits of as high as $180 per ton of CO2 recovered and sequestered underground. Current costs are higher than that. Frustrating (and inexplicable) for Hollub, the federal rules give maximum tax credits if the CO2 is permanently sequestered into non-oil saline reservoirs rather than used for enhanced oil recovery (whch gets $135 per ton). Hollub said that Oxy has already pre-sold carbon reduction credits tied to the project and hopes that, despite Trump administration promises to gut green subsidies, the Inflation Reduction Act’s so-called 45q provisions are kept in place. “It’s our one big ask” of the Trump Administration, said Hollub at the Hamm Institute conference: “Keep 45q in place for direct air capture. Make the credit equal to sequestration. Making net zero carbon oil is better than putting in a saline reservoirs. Getting penalized for not putting it in a saline is crazy.” The Trump administration has voiced its support for all manner of geologic sequestration. In early April Oxy and 1Point5 received its needed Class VI permits from the U.S. EPA to begin sequestering CO2 in a non-oilfield operation. EPA further announced this week that in Texas it would delegate future Class VI sequestration well permitting to state regulators. Once perfected, Oxy will look to license the technology to other industrial companies. Keeping an eye on developments is Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than a third of Oxy via shares and preferred stock. Berkshire is also sitting on 84 million Oxy warrants with a strike price of $59.62. With Oxy shares at $40, Buffett’s investment is billions of dollars underwater. Buffett might like to bring down his cost basis. Berkshire, sitting on more than $300 billion in cash, could well afford to gobble up the rest of Oxy (p/e 12, market cap $40 billion). Buffett has sold down holdings of Apple and Bank of America and only just begun to redeploy, adding recently to Berkshire’s holdings in a handful of Japanese conglomerates such as Itochu, Sumitomo, Marubeni, Mitsui and Mitsubishi. Mitsui last year invested in an unrelated direct air capture pilot plant in Louisiana, while Mitsubishi and Itochu are investors in an Australian carbon-capture-cement startup. Who knows, with Buffett as salesman, he might soon be selling them Oxy’s air capture machines. Asked on the sidelines of the conference how she would feel about Berkshire and Buffett someday acquiring the rest of Oxy, Hollub replied, “It would be a dream come true.”

Sen. Cory Booker stumped for the Equality Act with Democrats on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, accusing President Donald Trump's administration of targeting transgender people. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accused President Donald Trump's administration of targeting the transgender community on Tuesday, urging Congress to pass the Democrat-backed Equality Act. Booker made the emotional speech during an appearance on Capitol Hill alongside prominent Democrats from both the House and Senate. His speech, which lasted several minutes, borrowed heavily from the language of Martin Luther King, Jr. "The Equality Act is on the right side of history, and right now we stand in the cold shadow of injustice. And so here we are again, introducing this bill. But it is not a normal time that we introduce this bill. We introduced it in the backdrop of a president that in his very campaign, singled out an opportunistic bigotry. The trans community. We stand here in the backdrop of a time that LGBTQ Americans are being targeted and singled out for more injustice," Booker said. "I want you to know, we reintroduce this bill with attitude. We reintroduce this bill with swagger. We entered the bill Tuesday's bill with confidence, because there are a lot of people who are hearing our voice right now that don't understand that they are implicated. There's no bystanders in history. When injustice is in our midst, and you say nothing and you do nothing, you are part of the perpetuation of that injustice," he added. MULTIPLE FEDERAL AGENCIES END LINKEDIN CONTRACTS OVER DEI Sen. Cory Booker accused President Donald Trump's administration of "targeting" transgender people. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) "I remind those Americans, that even the truth, when crushed to the ground, after lie, after lie, after lie, that the truth will still rise again, that this is still one nation under God. That we still swear an oath of liberty and justice for all, and that we will not stop until freedom rings from every coast in this country. That freedom rings for every person and every soul. That freedom rings for every American, no matter who you are. Race, color or creed, LGBTQ, American or straight ally," he continued. "That we declare that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it doesn't bend automatically." TRUMP VOWS 'NEW ERA OF NATIONAL SUCCESS,' SAYS AMERICA'S 'DECLINE IS OVER' IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS "We declare today and every day until justice is established in this land, until the Equality Act passes, we declare that we, the people, will grab hold of that arc and pull and bend it until we live up to our promise in a country and truly are free at last, free at last," he finished.

Booker was joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as well as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., among other lawmakers. MAJOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER ACCUSED OF HIDING DEI PROGRAMS, INFLUENTIAL SENATOR CALLS THEM OUT The legislative push comes as Trump's administration has pushed to end unpopular diversity, equity and inclusion programs throughout the federal government. The president’s efforts to end DEI across the federal government also prompted the cancellation of such programs across the private sector. Meta, in January, canceled its DEI programs, as did McDonald's. And after the 2024 election, Walmart, Ford Motor Co., John Deere, Lowe's and Toyota also ended DEI programs. President Donald Trump has pushed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government. (AP/Alex Brandon) As recently as April, according to Forbes, IBM, Gannett, and Constellation Brands Inc., made changes to DEI policies. Earlier in 2025, UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria’s Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle and more scaled back or canceled their DEI programs.

Title: UPS to layoff 20,000 workers, close some facilities
URL: https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ups-layoffs-20000-jobs-cut-close-facilities-amazon-tariffs/

UPS is cutting 20,000 jobs and closing some facilities as the delivery company reduces the amount of Amazon packages it handles. The company said it plans to conduct the layoffs before the end of the year and close 73 facilities in buildings it owns or leases by the end of June — with more closings to possibly to come at a later date. “The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier,” CEO Carol Tomé said in a statement on Tuesday. “The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.” UPS and Amazon earlier this year agreed to pare back their shared business by more than 50%. “Amazon is our largest customer but it’s not our most profitable customer,” Tomé said at the time. Their output of 24 million packages a day on average (about 5.7 billion a year) represents about a quarter of all shipments in the U.S., according to the global shipping and logistics firm Pitney Bowes. The company has about 490,000 employees and operates in over 200 countries. It previously announced it was cutting 12,000 jobs in 2024. UPS and the Teamsters Union avoided a strike in 2023 and signed a five-year contract. Trump administration tariffs have already slowed down trade and led to cost cutting ahead of an anticipated drop in demand. The company recently unveiled its “Global Checkout” feature that tells customers upfront what they will have to pay in duties, fees and taxes.

© 2025 Cantata Media SHARE UPS will eliminate about 20,000 jobs throughout 2025 as part of a major cost-cutting plan fueled by a decline in Amazon shipments. A UPS delivery truck. A UPS tractor-trailer parked at a loading dock. The Atlanta-based shipping giant revealed the job cuts in a regulatory filing on Tuesday, April 29. UPS also plans to close 73 buildings by June as the company aims to save $3.5 billion by the end of 2025. CEO Carol Tomé said UPS is working to adapt to more difficult economic conditions for shippers due to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. "As a trusted leader in global logistics, we will leverage our integrated network and trade expertise to assist our customers as they adapt to a changing trade environment," said Tomé. "Further, the actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier. The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS." The layoffs came after UPS also laid off about 12,000 workers throughout 2024. UPS reported first-quarter 2025 revenues of $21.5 billion, down 0.7% from the previous first quarter. The move comes as UPS faces shifting demand and prepares for a sharp drop in deliveries from Amazon, CBS News reported. In January, UPS said it had reached an agreement to cut Amazon delivery volumes by more than 50% in the second half of 2026. "The reduction of package volume from Amazon is something UPS chose to do as we focus on revenue quality, and increase domestic operating margin and profitability," a UPS spokesperson told CBS. Amazon said it had offered to increase UPS' volumes before the delivery company decided to pull back. "Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision," an Amazon spokesperson said in an email to CBS. Customers can track how Trump's tariffs will impact UPS on its website. The company also has the "UPS Global Checkout" tool, showing upfront costs for duties, taxes, and fees.

Title: White House Panics After Report Claims Amazon Will Display Tariff Prices
URL: https://gizmodo.com/white-house-panics-after-report-claims-amazon-will-display-tariff-prices-2000595722
Time Published: 2025-04-29T17:16:07Z
Full Content:
White House officials held a press conference Tuesday morning to talk about the economy, as Americans get extremely nervous about the tariffs on China that are starting to cause prices to rise. And while Trump’s goons put on a brave face, it was clear they’re in panic mode. In fact, one question about Amazon really got them flustered. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted things were all going according to plan, even though Americans are starting to see 145% surcharges added to their shipments from Chinese retailers like Temu, Shein, and AliExpress. But when a reporter asked about a report from Punchbowl on Tuesday that Amazon would be listing tariff costs when consumers check out, Leavitt flipped her lid. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,â said Leavitt. “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Amazon probably didn’t add an “inflation” surcharge during the Biden years because that’s not a real thing that any normal person thinks of doing. But it’s very easy to add a tariff line because we know exactly how much that is going to cost consumers. In the case of Trump’s 145% tariff on goods from China, it’s going to be 145%. Leavitt went on to hold up a printout of a Reuters article from 2021 titled “Amazon Partnered With China Propaganda Arm.” The article notes that Amazon was marketing a collection of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speeches and writings on its online store in China about two years earlier. The crux of the story is that Amazon disabled reviews in the country after Chinese officials complained about negative reviews and added a page called China Books that promoted materials favorable to the government. Leavitt didn’t really provide any context for why she was talking about this story from years earlier, but clearly intended for the headline to be damning in its insinuations about collaboration with the Chinese government. But it looks like that report about Amazon listing tariffs wasn’t true. Or, at least things changed after the story broke. Reached for comment on Tuesday after the White House press conference, Amazon told Gizmodo that it won’t actually be adding a tariff line item to purchases. “The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement. CNN reports that Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after the Punchbowl news story landed Tuesday morning. A White House official told CNN that Trump was “pissed” adding “Why should a multi-billion-dollar company pass off costs to consumers?” Well, that part seems obvious to anyone with a basic understanding of economics. If the cost of importing goods is going up 145%, Amazon isn’t going to just eat that entire charge. They’re going to raise prices for consumers. White House advisor Stephen Miller was asked about the Amazon pricing controversy on Fox News and tried to play it off like as no big deal. “I’ll just take Amazon’s statement at face value, which is that they said this is an idea that had been discussed, was not being actioned, and now we can take heart in knowing that they formally rejected the idea,” Miller said. Miller was then asked about whether Trump had indeed called Bezos and the White House advisor laughed it off, insisting that things worked out just fine in the end. ROBERTS: I understand there might’ve been a phone call from the president to Jeff Bezos on this this morning STEPHEN MILLER: I have no news to add on it. All I can say is things worked out exactly as they should. [image or embed] â Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) April 29, 2025 at 10:12 AM Trump later confirmed that he had spoken with Bezos earlier in the day, saying, “Jeff Bezos was very nice, he was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly and he did the right thing and he’s a good guy.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump said about calling the Amazon founder regarding tariff prices being added to the site. “He solved the problem very quickly and he did the right thing and he’s a good guy.” [image or embed] â Matt Novak (@paleofuture.bsky.social) April 29, 2025 at 12:23 PM The consumer confidence index fell this month for the fifth straight month in a row, according to the Associated Press. And if you take a quick look at the calendar, five months ago was November, the same month Trump was elected. Bessent was asked Tuesday about supply chains that are expected to break down in the coming weeks, as ships from China have basically stopped leaving for U.S. ports. But the Treasury Secretary insisted that everything would be fine since he imagined businesses have already planned ahead for any disruptions. “I wouldn’t think that we would have supply chain shocks,” said Bessent. “And I think retailers that have managed their inventory in front of this. I speak to dozens of companies sometimes daily, but definitely weekly, and they know that President Trump is committed to fair trade and have planned accordingly.” Bessent has made this same argument repeatedly in recent days. He asserts that there won’t actually be supply chain shocks because every business knew this was coming and should’ve planned appropriately. That argument ignores the fact that it’s difficult to just find a new supplier for inexpensive Chinese goods in less than a month, if you’re able to do that at all by some miracle. Adidas warned Tuesday it would soon be raising prices on goods for Americans. And some companies are already doing layoffs over the economic situation, with shipping company UPS announcing Tuesday it was cutting 20,000 jobs from its 490,000-person workforce. The company said in a regulatory filing that it was “in connection with our anticipation of lower volumes” from Amazon, the company’s largest customer. Trump has claimed that he’s signing new trade deals with every country, given the fact that even America’s closest allies have been hit with a 10% tariff. But there’s scant evidence that any trade deal is anywhere close to being completed. Bessent keeps teasing the idea that deals are almost done with Japan and India, but the timing on when those could be done isn’t clear at all. Trump has also said he’s negotiating with China, but that doesn’t seem to be true either. âLet me make it clear one more time that China and the U.S. are not engaged in any consultation or negotiation on tariffs,â Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Monday, according to CNBC. Fox News, Trump’s favorite TV channel, has done its best to sell the idea that these tariffs are good, but even there, we’re starting to see some dissent. Dana Perino, a host on the network and former press secretary for the White House under George W. Bush, said on Tuesday that she doesn’t like tariffs and is worried about how small businesses are going to do under them. “I think that it’s one thing as a consumer to say I will be able to accept the pain,” Perino said. “But the small- and medium-sized business owner, who right now are looking at the possibility of losing everything that they’ve worked for in the next four to six weeks, is very real.” There’s understandably been a fixation on tariffs this week, as Americans are starting to learn about how they will soon pay more for just about everything. But Trump is also working hard to make the United States an unlivable hellhole in other ways. The president’s regime is terrorizing immigrant communities, jailing political dissidents like Rumeysa Ozturk, who did nothing more than write an op-ed against the war in Gaza, and kicking pediatric cancer patients out of the country without their medications. Trump’s FBI also arrested a judge in Wisconsin last week for allegedly not doing enough to help ICE detain an immigrant in her courtroom. And the president signed an executive order on Monday that experts warn will further militarize American police. A recent poll from PRRI shows that 52% of Americans agree with the statement that Trump is a “dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy.” The president’s approval rating is in the toilet, and Trump’s right-hand oligarch, Elon Musk, is getting similar marks, with just 35% of Americans approving of his obliteration of the government with DOGE. Yes, Trump is hurting everything good about America. But at least everything’s going to be much more expensive soon. America truly shot itself in the foot by electing Trump again. And with Trump promising to stay in office illegally after 2028, there’s no telling when the madness may end. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: Trump buries Biden foreign policy in first 100 days

Time Published: 2025-04-29T17:00:01Z

Middle East Forum Executive Director Gregg Roman described President Donald Trump’s foreign policy approach as one that makes those who harm American interests "pay." One hundred days into his new administration, President Donald Trump has reset negotiations with allies and foes across the globe, and experts say one is certain: it is all transactional. Gone are the days when the U.S. could be drawn to throw its force around the world solely in the name of defending or spreading democracy. Global leaders are learning to speak a new language with U.S. leadership, one that is less about ideology and more about how their interests benefit U.S. interests. "There is a lot more transactional engagement rather than I think we're ideological-based, policy decisions that were sort of the hallmark of the Biden administration," said Gregg Roman, executive director of the Middle East Forum. Here is a round-up of how Trump has changed U.S. foreign policy since taking office: FOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, left, and President Donald Trump are working on a nuclear deal. (West Asia News Agency, Reuters | SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) Former President Joe Biden toyed with reviving a nuclear deal with Iran and criticized Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but his administration made little progress toward serious negotiations. Trump has now expressed interest in a new nuclear deal. He told Israel the U.S. would not come to their aid in attacking Iran until diplomatic negotiations played out. As Trump’s team met with Iranian counterparts in Oman this weekend for a second round of nuclear talks, he issued another threat: if negotiations whither away, the U.S. would not be dragged by Israel into war with Iran but will be "leading the pack." An offensive campaign against Yemen’s Houthi terrorists launched six weeks ago has struck more than 800 targets and cost nearly $1 billion – a sharp departure from the tit-for-tat retaliatory strikes seen under the Biden administration, when Houthis attacked U.S. naval ships and Western commercial vessels. "Biden pursued a policy of retaliatory strikes: If you hit us, we'll hit you," said Roman. "What Trump is trying to do is what I call a salting the earth strategy. If you dare challenge American military supremacy or the ability for us to conduct free trade to the bottom of or through the Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Yemen, Red Sea, Suez … We will attempt to end your ability to wage war on the United States in its interests."

One hundred days in, the war is not over. Negotiations are ongoing, and Trump has jumped between sounding off in frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Putin continues to strike even civilian regions of Ukraine, Trump questioned on Saturday whether the Russian leader truly wants peace or is "tapping me along." He again questioned whether he would need to slap "secondary sanctions" on nations that do business with Russia to starve its war coffers. On Monday, Russia offered a three-day ceasefire from May 8-10, but the White House was not satisfied. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump wants a "permanent ceasefire." Trump met face-to-face with Zelenskyy in Rome on Saturday, the first time since their infamous Oval Office spat in February, after slamming Zelenskyy’s latest rejection of his peace proposal, one that would have formally ceded Crimea to the Russians.

(Vatican and Ukraine Ambassador to Holy See) The Monroe Doctrine is back, analysts say, and Trump wants both Greenland and the Panama Canal under U.S. control. The proposals drew shock across the world, but at least in Panama, Trump’s bold words prompted a proposal to offer the U.S. "first and free" passage for its warships, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said earlier this month. It also spurred the proposed sale of two ports of entry from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S.-based BlackRock, though that deal has been delayed by Chinese regulatory and political scrutiny. Efforts to attain Greenland have proved less successful. Tough talk against Denmark and its ownership of Greenland has ratcheted up tensions with the NATO ally and Greenland’s leadership has expressed little interest in becoming a part of the U.S. However, Trump has called out the threat of Russia and China’s increasing arctic military capabilities – the shortest range for a missile to travel from Russia to the U.S. would be over the icy island’s territory. Trump is also interested in the rare earth mining potential of the massive swath of land. President Donald Trump wants the U.S. to control the Panama Canal. (REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) Trump’s threats to pull out of the NATO alliance – or refuse to come to the defense of allies that do not contribute enough military spending – has left nations across the world planning for the contingency that they may have to defend themselves without U.S. aid. The European Union announced a plan for its nations to spend $840 billion to "re-arm Europe" after Trump halted all aid to Ukraine in March. Countries like Spain, Belgium and Sweden have all announced plans this year to increase defense spending to meet NATO’s 2% target, while eastern European states near Russia’s border, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland, have announced plans to increase defense spending to around 5%. Concern over China’s hegemonic ambitions bridges the partisan divide, but the Biden White House never considered such drastic measures as 145% tariffs. Trump has said the goal of the tariffs is to both bring back US manufacturing after decades of offshore production and punish China for intellectual property theft, a massive trade imbalance, and fentanyl flowing from China to the U.S. A free trade push in the early 2000s had wrongly assumed liberal trade policies would bring democratic values and free markets into Chinese borders, his supporters argue. Trump has insisted that President Xi Jinping wants to cut a deal to lower the soaring tariffs, even as China has rejected the prospect of talks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is unclear what sort of realistic concessions the U.S. could get out of a deal, perhaps promises to buy more American-made agricultural products, fuel or other specialty goods. For now, steep tariffs remain, and China is choking off U.S. supply of critical minerals, which could spell deep trouble for everyday electronics, electric vehicles and defense equipment.

Title: UPS cutting around 20,000 jobs due to 'new or increased tariffs'; 73 buildings closing
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/04/29/ups-job-cuts-building-closures-2025/83343016007/

The United Parcel Service (UPS) is expected to reduce its workforce by roughly 20,000 during 2025, citing "new or increased tariffs" and "changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally" for the cuts. UPS announced the layoffs April 29 in its first quarter earnings report, in which the parcel delivery service said it made consolidated revenues of $21.5 billion, compared to $21.7 billion around the same time a year ago. The shipping company also said it would be closing roughly 164 facilities by the end of the year. Consolidation efforts for UPS come as President Donald Trump's looming tariffs continue to impact U.S. and global trade, as companies across the country are reducing costs in preparation for a possible economic fallout. In 2024, UPS employed around 490,000 people worldwide, including about 330,000 Teamsters-represented jobs in the U.S. "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," Carol Tomé, UPS's chief executive officer, said in the report. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.” For UPS specifically, it cautioned in January that it was expediting its plan to reduce millions of deliveries for its largest customer, Amazon.com, which accounted for 11.8% of its overall revenue in 2024, CNBC reported. “We are reducing the amount of volume we deliver for Amazon by more than 50% by June 2026," Brian Dykes, UPS' chief financial officer, said in a statement to USA TODAY. "Associated with this volume reduction, we are undertaking the largest network reconfiguration in our history. This effort has been combined with our Network of the Future initiative as both will help drive us to a more efficient network." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt lashed out at Amazon after a report said the e-commerce giant was planning to list the costs of Trump's tariffs next to the total prices of products, which Leavitt called "a hostile and political act" while speaking to reporters on April 29. According to Dyke, UPS's "planned reductions are in line with the total Amazon volume decline.” In addition to the position cuts, UPS said it plans to close 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June 2025, according to the earnings report. Dyke said the total number of operational closures by the end of the year is expected to be 164. The closures will consist of facilities that are part of UPS' U.S. Ground operation, where packages are unloaded, sorted and loaded, a spokesperson told USA TODAY. "We are continuing to review our network and may identify additional buildings for closure," the Atlanta-based parcel delivery service said. The job cuts and building closures are expected to save UPS $3.5 billion in 2025, the earnings report says. UPS' consolidation and cost-saving initiative, "Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined," is expected to end in 2027, according to the parcel delivery service. UPS, the world’s largest package delivery firm, forecasted in January a full-year revenue of $89 billion, CNBC reported. In January 2024, UPS announced the layoffs of nearly 12,000 employees across the globe to "align resources for 2024." During a company earnings call at the time, Tomé said the cuts would save the company nearly $1 billion. His comments came after UPS underwent a massive year-over-year decline in revenue. “I want to thank UPSers for providing the best on-time performance of any carrier for the sixth year in a row,” Tomé said in a statement released by the company in 2024. “2023 was a unique and difficult year and through it all we remained focused on controlling what we could control, stayed on strategy and strengthened our foundation for future growth.”

Title: UPS Slashes 20,000 Jobs as it Weans Off Amazon

By Glenn Taylor UPS is cutting 20,000 jobs this year, or 4 percent of its total workforce, as the package delivery giant powers through its decoupling with Amazon. The courier’s layoffs are a side effect of the company’s Network of the Future plan, which is intended to make UPS more reliant on automated processes within warehouses and consolidate sorting facilities. Along with the 20,000 job closures, 73 leased and owned buildings will be shuttered by June. The company anticipates $3.5 billion of total cost savings through these measures. During a Tuesday earnings call, Brian Dykes, chief financial officer at UPS, said the reconfiguration is aligned with the anticipated Amazon volume reduction across 2025. UPS had already expected to cut volume it moves for Amazon by 50 percent by the 2026 second half. In the first quarter, Amazon average daily volume (ADV) decreased 16 percent year over year, “which was more than we originally planned,” according to Dykes. Second quarter ADV is projected to have the same decline. The back half of 2025 should see steeper declines of roughly 30 percent in each quarter. Amazon accounted for 11.8 percent of UPS revenue in 2024, but the latter has looked to wean off the e-commerce giant as the partnership has weighed on profit margins. Related Stories Topics West Coast Port Union Slams Trump's 'Reckless, Shortsighted' Tariff Policy Topics White House Calls Amazon's Reported Tariff Transparency Plans a 'Hostile and Political Act' For the first quarter, UPS generated $21.5 billion in revenue, a 0.7 percent decrease from the year-ago period and had a net income of $1.2 billion, up 7 percent from $1.1 billion in the year prior. Domestic daily volume slipped 3.5 percent to 17.4 million packages, dragging down the overall worldwide package volume to a 1.9 percent dip to 20.8 million parcels. “While volume and revenue performance in the quarter were in line with our expectations, our monthly performance was not,” said Dykes. “In U.S. domestic, following a strong January relative to our expectations, uncertainty in the market began impacting consumer behavior. Demand shifted down in February, falling further than our expectations and normal shipping patterns and remained at that level in March.” Like many public companies navigating the current geopolitical environment, UPS is not providing a full-year guidance. During the call, UPS said the business is expected to generate $21 billion in revenue and in operating margin of about 9.3 percent in the second quarter. That would be a 3.7 percent decline from the $21.8 billion brought in during the year prior, but above last year’s 8.9 percent margin. However, the uncertainty related to the tariffs levied by the Trump administration is expected to bring ADVs down 9 percent in the U.S. domestic business, with domestic revenue anticipated to dip in the low-single digits. SMBs will be “disproportionally impacted,” Dykes said. “Many of our SMBs as we talk to them are 100-percent single sourced from China,” said CEO Carol Tomé in the call, citing the 145-percent tariff on Chinese imports and the elimination of the de minimis exemption. “Our SMBs who don’t have the working capital capabilities to pull forward inventory are saying, ‘how are we going to handle this cost increase that’s coming our way?’” Tomé noted that these businesses are seeking alternate forms of supply, and working with original equipment manufacturers trying to move to other countries. However, she acknowledged “the large companies get to take the first phone call.” While UPS exposure to China is roughly 400,000 imported packages per day, or less than 2 percent of total global ADV, revenue on the China-to-U.S. trade lane was 11 percent of total international revenue. “Our China to U.S. trade lanes are our most profitable trade lanes,” said Tomé, who noted that the courier has had ongoing discussions with its top 100 customers to understand the impacts of Trump’s trade policy. “These customers have told us that they are exploring various options to address the tariff from absorbing the cost to pushing them into retail prices to asking suppliers to help defray the expense.” On the call, Dykes also said UPS is evaluating approximately 50 more warehouses to close as it continues its network consolidation. Sixty-four percent of UPS volume now goes through an automated hub—up 4.5 percentage points from the year prior, according to Dykes. The earnings report came a day after Bloomberg said UPS was in talks to partner with robotics startup Figure AI to use humanoid robots within its warehousing network, which would further the focus on automation and put more jobs in doubt. “There’s much more to automation than just automating the sort,” said Tomé, who didn’t confirm the partnership. “We’re also looking at the use of robotics for automatic label application and many other automatic opportunities like unloading and loading trailers.” Nando Cesarone, president U.S. at UPS, reiterated that the end goal is to have 400 fully or semi-automated warehouses, with 200 facilities expected to be shuttered by 2028. “We’re working ahead of ourselves as new automation technology—the application of AI in certain areas to help us with labor—is introduced into these operations, and that allows us to really take cost out of the network,” Cesarone said. “The end result will be a much more efficient operation with less dependency on labor.” As of the company’s annual report released in March, UPS had 490,000 total employees, excluding temporary seasonal employees. More than 75 percent of the 406,000 U.S. employees are unionized, represented by either the Teamsters or the Independent Pilots Association. “United Parcel Service is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under our current national master agreement,” said Teamsters general president Sean O’Brien in a statement. “If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won’t stand in its way. But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.” Stock price has been largely unaffected by the layoffs, inching down 0.4 percent by noon Tuesday.

Title: Zuckerberg Vs Musk: Who Lost More Wealth From Their Stock In 2025

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 20: (L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, ... More Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Tens of billions of dollars in personal wealth vanished in just months. As the economy shifts and policies reset, two of the world’s most influential entrepreneurs - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Meta (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg - are seeing the value of their holdings shrink. Not because they misstepped, but because the ground beneath them shifted: politics, markets, and public expectations are rewriting the rules of success. For more on Meta’s success see M&A: Meta’s Four Critical Acquisitions. It isn’t uncommon for founder wealth to fluctuate dramatically - mostly because the bulk of their wealth is tied to a single stock. But that shouldn’t be you. The High Quality portfolio, designed to sidestep stock-specific shocks and lower volatility, has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception So who lost more? And what does it tell us about the next chapter for American business? Musk lost nearly $100 billion or >20% of his net worth, while Zuckerberg, unlike the crash of 2022, saw his wealth decline by only 6.5% closely mimicking the stock decline this year. Wealth Comparison: Musk vs Zuckerberg Both remain among the wealthiest individuals globally, but the scale of the decline - especially Musk’s - is notable. So far in 2025: While much of this has to do with the broader market decline resulting from Trump’s push for tariffs, there is more to the story for each of the stocks. Tesla’s stock initially surged after Donald Trump’s 2024 election win, driven by optimism around protectionist manufacturing policies and possibly Musk’s closeness with the president. However, those gains evaporated quickly as the realities of a highly competitive EV market - including intense pressure from Chinese manufacturers - set in. Tesla’s Q1 2025 vehicle deliveries missed expectations and its margins fell to the lowest level seen in the last 5 years. Meta’s decline, meanwhile, reflects slower-than-expected growth in digital advertising and longer timelines for AI-driven monetization, alongside continued investment losses in its Reality Labs division. It’s important to understand: Wealth - specifically from stock ownership - is not taxed, and taxes are due when stock is sold and wealth becomes income. However, when billionaires pledge shares as collateral for personal loans, a falling stock price can impact debt covenants. Lenders may require repayment or more collateral if the value of pledged shares declines substantially. If borrowers are unable or unwilling to provide more collateral, they may have to sell stock - potentially under less favorable conditions. At this time: So far, no public filings suggest Musk has faced such a situation of forced liquidation in 2025 - but the risk is structurally higher compared to Zuckerberg, who has historically avoided significant personal leverage against Meta shares. This isn’t just a scoreboard of billionaire wealth. There are deeper implications: Founders’ wealth is highly concentrated in companies they run. And that means large fluctuations - but that’s fine. They can take the risk as they run those companies. But when it comes to long-term money compounding for most of us - a simple rule is - never put all your eggs in one basket. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is designed to diversify stock-specific risk while providing exposure to the upside. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market performance and candlestick chart visible in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and trading activity, on April 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) If you still think of Meta (NASDAQ:META) as “just the Facebook company,” you’re missing the real story - a story written in billion-dollar deals, aggressive digital land-grabs, and a playbook of strategic domination that would make even the most ruthless CEOs blush. Over the past decade, four critical acquisitions didn’t just help Meta survive - they catapulted it into an empire. As an aside, for more Meta see Zuckerberg vs Musk: Who Lost More Wealth In 2025? Investors tend to be skeptical about acquisitions - but they aren’t all bad, as Meta has shown. When done right, they have a purpose. They help expand, create moats, and in some cases, cripple the competition. Identifying such competitive advantages (or disadvantages) from acquisitions is one of the lenses we apply in High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s break down the four game-changers that made Meta the beast it is today. Imagine buying a scrappy photo-sharing app with few million users and turning it into a massive business. That’s exactly what Meta (then Facebook) did when it scooped up Instagram for what now looks like a "modest" $1 billion in 2012. Fast forward to 2025 and Instagram’s share of Meta’s revenue could exceed 50% in 2025. Yes, you read that right! That would mean nearly $80-90 billion in revenue from Instagram ads. Assuming net margin of 30% (Meta overall has 35%+) and a modest PE multiple of 20x, Instagram alone is worth $500 billion. That’s bigger than most S&P 500 cash rich giants! $19 billion sounded insane at the time. But Meta wasn’t buying WhatsApp for its revenues - it was buying scale, reach and relevance in every corner of the globe. WhatsApp has nearly 3 billion monthly unique users. While it is far from Instagram-level monetization, WhatsApp is positioning itself as Meta’s "super app" for payments, e-commerce, and business messaging. There are estimates of “business messaging” itself having revenue potential of $30-$40 billion. India is home to the largest WhatsApp user base of nearly 500 million. The government of India removed 100 million user cap for WhatsApp Pay at the end of 2024 - opening the digital payment market to more competition, which is currently dominated by Google Pay and PhonPe. When Meta acquired Oculus VR in 2014, people thought Zuckerberg had lost his mind. (VR headsets? Really?) But Oculus wasn’t just a tech toy - it was the first brick in Zuckerberg’s ambitious vision for the "metaverse," a concept Meta has been pouring over $10 billion per year into developing. Oculus, now rebranded as Meta Quest, dominates the consumer VR market - with over 70% unit market share globally. While still a small fraction of Meta’s total revenue, the growth of the VR market is explosive. According to IDC, the global AR/VR headset unit sales could more than triple by 2028. If Instagram was about photos, and WhatsApp about messages, CTRL-Labs was about the future of how we even interact with technology. Meta quietly picked up this brain-computer interface startup for a rumored $500 million to $1 billion, and it could end up being one of its most profound investments. CTRL-Labs’ technology is still in the experimental stage, but it’s part of Meta’s larger vision for the metaverse and augmented reality. Meta has integrated CTRL-Labs into its Reality Labs division, where it’s exploring how brain-computer interfaces could revolutionize VR/AR interaction and eventually lead to neural-driven devices. As Meta continues to invest in CTRL-Labs’ neural interface technology, the integration of this system into VR headsets and AR glasses could redefine user interaction. When people criticize Meta for its massive spending sprees, they miss the forest for the trees. These four deals - Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and CTRL-Labs - aren’t just acquisitions. They’re foundations. Each one secured Meta’s dominance in a critical arena: social media, global communications, virtual reality, and human-machine interaction. Does it make you want to buy and hold on to Meta stock? Well that wouldn’t be the worst idea. But here is the thing - going all-in in a single stock - no matter how good - is a recipe for disaster. Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is designed to diversify stock-specific while providing exposure to the upside. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that?

Popular on Variety Khaled’s long list of musical collaborators includes Jay-Z, Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Drake, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, Lil Wayne and many others. Terms of the deal were not disclosed further; several film projects are currently in various stages of development as a result of the alliance, according to the announcement. Founded in 2019, Influence Media’s investment strategy is built on “modern evergreens,” songs, and diverse artists with a strong potential for long-term impact on pop culture. The latest round of capital also follows the launch of Influence’s independent record label, music publishing and distribution company, Slang, which signed Will Smith last year. Backed by BlackRock and Warner Music Group, Influence’s latest fund has secured more than 30 music-rights investments, also including Enrique Iglesias, Blake Shelton, Jessie Reyez, songwriter-producer Julia Michaels, and others; in January it secured $360 million in debt financing. Khaled said, “I’m proud that my legacy will continue to resonate and connect with audiences around the world with this partnership through Influence Media. These iconic recordings I’ve created will continue to be curated in the most optimum manner to impact culture with nearly two decades of music. In addition, I’m excited for the world to see and experience the film and television projects Influence and We The Best are developing and producing together. This next phase of my career will be filled with ground-breaking cultural impact, and I look forward to being at the forefront in all categories.” “Influence Media was founded on the principle that music can move culture, and few entertainers embody this more than DJ Khaled,” said Lylette Pizarro, Influence Media Founder and Co-Managing Partner. “Our joint venture NIL deal, and extended catalog partnership is an alliance that will create boundless opportunities for this creative genius, and will also further establish that DJ Khaled is a rare talent whose abilities extend far beyond the traditional confines of music. His enormous creativity, heart, and drive are matched only by his savvy business instincts and that is why the possibilities of what we can build together in this collaboration are immeasurable.” “DJ Khaled has had so many iconic eras in his career to date, and we couldn’t be more excited to build ‘another one’ through this first-of-its-kind partnership,” says Rene McLean, Influence Media Partner and CEO of Slang. “Much in the same way that all the top artists consider a DJ Khaled collab a major career milestone, we think of this as a huge step forward for Slang.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: UPS layoffs: Package delivery company to cut 20,000 jobs, close 73 facilities as it reduces amount of Amazon shipments it handles

UPS is looking to slash about 20,000 jobs and close more than 70 facilities as it drastically reduces the amount of Amazon shipments it handles. The package delivery company said Tuesday that it anticipates making the job cuts this year. It anticipates closing 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June. UPS said that it is still reviewing its network and may identify more buildings to be shuttered. "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," CEO Carol Tomé said in a statement on Tuesday. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS." In January UPS announced that it had reached a deal with Amazon, its biggest customer, to lower its volume by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. During UPS' fourth-quarter earnings conference call in January, Tomé said that the company had partnered with Amazon for almost 30 years and that when its contract came up this year, UPS decided to reassess the relationship. "Amazon is our largest customer but it's not our most profitable customer," Tomé said at the time. "Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business." Tomé said that UPS considered various options and determined that the volume reduction was the best alternative. The company employs about 490,000 workers, according to FactSet. United Parcel Service Inc. also reported its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday. The Atlanta-based company earned $1.19 billion, or $$1.40 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Stripping out certain items, earnings were $1.49 per share. That's better than the $1.44 per share that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research were calling for. Revenue totaled $21.55 billion, beating Wall Street's estimate of $21.06 billion. UPS said that it wasn't providing any updates to its previously announced full-year outlook, given current macroeconomic uncertainty. The company previously said that it expected 2025 revenue of approximately $89 billion. Shares of UPS rose slightly in morning trading.

WSOC Now Shipping giant UPS announced on Tuesday that it will be cutting 20,000 jobs to cut costs. The announcement was made during UPS’s earnings call, Reuters reported. One reason given was fewer deliveries from Amazon. UPS announced in January that it planned to cut the number of Amazon packages by more than half over the next year and a half. “Amazon is our largest customer, but it’s not our most profitable customer,” CEO Carol Tomé said in January, according to The Associated Press. “Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business.” The layoffs will affect about 4% of the 490,000-member workforce, CBS News reported. The cuts will come from the operational workforce, which, according to Bloomberg, includes delivery drivers and package handlers. The company will also close 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June, with more locations possibly closing. The layoffs and the closures will save an estimated $3.5 billion this year for UPS. “The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier,” CEO Carol Tomé said, according to the AP. “The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.” Amazon said it will continue to partner with UPS and other carriers. Amazon and UPS had been partners for nearly 30 years as of January, the AP reported. Last year, UPS cut 12,000 management jobs, Bloomberg reported. ©2025 Cox Media Group © 2025 Cox Media Group.

Tomé said at the time that the company planned to make more changes so they'd be more profitable, going forward. “We are making business and operational changes that, along with the foundational changes we’ve already made, will put us further down the path to becoming a more profitable, agile and differentiated UPS that is growing in the best parts of the market,” Tomé said in a statement. With Tuesday's earnings call, it appears the plan to change now includes mass layoffs. A check of the Georgia WARN Notice portal, a federally required tracker for layoffs, does not yet show any UPS facilities in the state. Channel 2 Action News requested a more detailed list of where positions and facilities would close was requested from UPS. ©2025 Cox Media Group © 2025 Cox Media Group.

Title: Best Crypto to Buy Now as Crypto Market Shifts Bullish. Could Altcoins Rally?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After a two-month-long downfall, which saw the total market cap of the top meme coins fall from $116.6B to just $40B, the meme coin market is up and running again. It has gained a staggering 45% in market cap in around three weeks. Moreover, last week, Bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest inflows ($3B) since December. Plus, according to a recent forecast by financial services company Standard Chartered, we could see $BTC touching $120K by Q2 2025. Seeing as it’s only the beginning of what could be a long rally, now’s the best time to beef up your crypto portfolio with some trendy altcoins. To help you out, we’ve handpicked the best crypto to buy now. There’s really no denying that Donald Trump has taken crypto to new heights. For instance, the massive rally in November was on the back of the promises he made in his presidential campaign to make the US more crypto-friendly. Trump indeed delivered on his promises, as we’re now seeing an unprecedented increase in government-level Bitcoin reserves worldwide. Large institutions like Strategy and BlackRock are also buying $BTC left, right, and center. So, it’s only fair that Donald Trump’s very own meme coin, $TRUMP, is strongly placed in the list of the top trending cryptos. $TRUMP has jumped over 50% in the last seven days, and more than 32% in the last month or so. It’s worth noting, however, that $TRUMP is still nowhere close to its full potential. Remember, it reached around $72 when it launched in late January. Another reason to be optimistic about $TRUMP’s future is the president’s direct interest in the project’s prosperity. For instance, he recently announced that the top 220 $TRUMP holders will be invited to dinner with him. It’s worth remembering that an enthusiastic meme coin market is often the result of the king cryptocurrency, i.e., Bitcoin, soaring to new heights. If you want to make the most of Bitcoin’s rise specifically, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL), the best Bitcoin-themed crypto on the market right now. While other coins offer more of their own tokens for free as part of their airdrops, $BTCBULL stands out by offering free (and real) $BTC in its airdrops. This is also how it has tied itself to Bitcoin’s success story. BTC Bull Token’s airdrops will take place every time $BTC crosses a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Keep in mind that you’ll only be eligible for your share of free Bitcoins if you store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. What’s more, the developers have also planned to follow a steady burn mechanism, which involves reducing the token’s total supply bit by bit at regular intervals. This is done to boost the token’s demand, trading volume, and ultimately its price. You can join the ‘Bull Army’ by joining the $BTCBULL presale for just $0.002485 per token. The project has raised over $5.1M so far. Want in? Here’s a full guide on how to buy $BTCBULL. Jelly-My-Jelly is a meme coin on the Solana network created by Iqram Magdon-Ismail, the co-founder of Venmo, and Sam Lessin, a crypto investor. On paper, $JEELYJELLY has been touted as the crypto that grants holders early-bird access to the upcoming Jelly Jelly video-sharing app. The app will reportedly offer the fastest way to post bite-sized clips, known as ‘Jellies,’ from a video chat. However, the token’s current bull run is driven by community backing rather than anything else. Jelly-My-Jelly’s recent performance has been just as delicious as its name. It has rocketed 200% in the last seven days – from around $0.012 to $0.033. It’s currently flirting with its major resistance level of $0.40, the break of which could see it shoot to new highs and result in even more mind-boggling gains. Solaxy ($SOLX) is unlike most other meme coins mentioned on this list. That’s because it’s a token with real utility and real-world application. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana, which has been plagued with congestion and scalability issues ever since the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on it. Meme coin developers prefer Solana because of its high speed and low fees. However, because the network is now experiencing an overload of meme coin traders and investors, it’s no longer as smooth a blockchain as it once was. Solaxy will solve this by processing a bunch of Solana’s transactions on a sidechain. By redirecting transaction requests away from the network’s mainnet, Solaxy will reduce the burden on Solana and restore its speed of executing transactions. Additionally, Solaxy will club several transaction requests and process them together, thereby reducing transaction costs and improving Solana’s affordability. For more info, check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy. ai16z is the first-ever decentralized venture capital firm to use the inputs of AI agents for its decision-making. This unique AI-powered trading fund is based on the Solana blockchain. Unlike traditional venture capital firms that need a lot of time and manpower for research before investing, ai16z will bank on cutting-edge AI agents to collect and analyze data, including market sentiments. $AI16Z is already up 97% in the last seven days, but it has only just broken out of a descending resistance line. This means that there could be more gains in store, including a potential run to the $0.60 level, which would result in a nearly 200% upmove from its current price of $0.3021. Even though the current sentiment among crypto investors is positive, it’s worth remembering that crypto is one market where things, especially future outlooks, can change quickly. With that in mind, you must always invest cautiously, which includes only throwing in an amount you’re comfortable losing. Finally, kindly do your own research before investing.

Title: The Quiet Revolution In Asset Markets And Tokenization

BySean Lee BySean Lee, Contributor. Tokenization and the Financial System Forum during the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings at the ... More International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters in Washington, Wednesday, April 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) When Mantra’s $OM token crashed in the start of April, crypto skeptics had their moment. Another real-world assets (RWAs) blockchain project bites the dust, they said. Traditional finance would surely retreat from tokenization experiments. The crash wiped out millions in value overnight, adding to the long list of crypto’s cautionary tales. Then, something strange happened. The money kept flowing in, but not to speculative tokens. Instead, it flowed to RWAs on the blockchain. BlackRock continued building. Franklin Templeton doubled down. By April, total value locked (TVL) in tokenized assets crossed the $20 billion mark. While experts speculated the Mantra collapse would scare institutions away, it showed them exactly what not to do. Asset managers discovered something valuable in blockchain’s infrastructure. They began moving Treasury bills, rental income, and private credit onto chains. Global markets used to run on these fundamental assets. And now they run faster. Institutional adoption brings new demands for blockchain infrastructure. Zero Hash exemplifies this shift, processing over $2 billion in tokenized fund flows across 22 blockchains in just four months. Their rails now support seven different stablecoins, powering settlements for giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Regulatory compliance drives innovation, too. Chintai secured licenses from Singapore’s MAS for compliant issuance and trading. Their Nexus platform now handles $675 million in tokenized value, with ambitious plans to reach $10 billion this year. The focus on regulation attracts serious institutional capital — their recent partnerships with RealNOI bringing $570 million in rental income on-chain and Kin Capital’s tokenized $100M real estate debt fund are just a few examples. It’s these infrastructure providers that lay the groundwork for specialized innovation. Money market funds move trillions of dollars daily through global markets. These funds form the backbone of institutional cash management, yet they still settle through systems designed decades ago. Franklin Templeton saw an opportunity to change this. Jiritsu’s $JUSD stablecoin launch on BNB Chain started modestly — just $1 million in TVL — but brought something new to market. Their MintBurn system provides real-time proof of reserves, letting users verify their backing at any moment. The stablecoin draws its stability from Franklin Templeton’s BENJI U.S. Money Market Fund, creating a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain efficiency. Traditional stablecoins rely on monthly attestations, while Jiritsu’s system updates these proofs continuously. Users see exactly what backs their assets and when those assets move. No more waiting for monthly reports or trusting third-party auditors. The project’s second phase aims beyond simple scaling. Its permissionless framework could allow any regulated fund to bring assets on-chain using the same infrastructure. For instance, money market funds represent a $7 trillion market globally. Just moving even a fraction of that onto blockchain infrastructure could reshape institutional cash management. While it’s true that tokenized assets require lots of infrastructure, they also need liquidity. Major market makers spotted this opportunity early. Jane Street began providing liquidity for BlackRock’s tokenized funds in February. Citadel Securities launched a dedicated digital asset desk focusing exclusively on regulated, tokenized securities. That means traditional finance wants to shape how these assets trade. And the performance data backs their interest. RWA tokens weathered recent market volatility better than their purely crypto counterparts. CHEX, powering Chintai’s regulated platform, maintained stability during the March downturn. The token’s value reflects growing institutional confidence in regulated tokenization platforms. Innovation spreads beyond conventional financial instruments. RealNOI and Kin Capital’s partnerships with Chintai demonstrates the potential for alternative income streams. Their platform tokenizes rental income from 1,900 apartments, offering investors exposure to real estate cash flows without the burden of property management. Projected annual returns above 5% attracted both crypto natives and traditional real estate investors. Other experiments push boundaries further. Republic’s private credit platform brought traditionally illiquid loans on-chain. Zero Hash expanded beyond simple settlement, building specialized rails for dividend distributions and corporate actions. Each successful implementation creates a template for other institutions to follow. The Mantra collapse shook market confidence in March. Excessive leverage had amplified volatility, triggering a wave of liquidations across the platform. Beyond immediate losses, the incident forced hard questions about risk management in RWA protocols. Market data reveals broader sector resilience. Through April, Maple Finance saw institutional deposits climb steadily. Their focus remained simple: conservative lending backed by verified assets. Circle’s USDC expanded into settlement layers for tokenized securities. Even BlackRock pushed forward with their BUIDL initiative, treating Mantra’s troubles as an isolated case. This resilience stems from fundamental differences in RWA tokens. Real assets generate actual cash flows. Treasury yields arrive on schedule. Rental income flows monthly. These are productive assets made more efficient through tokenization, and that’s why big institutions continue to back them. Regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets evolve unevenly across markets. Singapore’s MAS cleared the path with precise guidelines. Hong Kong welcomed tokenized funds with open arms. The U.S. SEC moves cautiously but steadily, evaluating each regulated tokenization proposal. Technical innovation has evolved hand-in-hand with regulatory progress, transforming compliance processes into automated systems. Verification systems deliver transparency without compromising security. These advances streamline institutional participation while maintaining regulatory standards. The impact of these changes becomes clearer each month. Traditional finance and blockchain efficiency draw closer each month. Banks reimagine settlement through tokenization. Asset managers experiment with programmable securities. Trading desks adapt to handle digital assets. Every step forward cements RWAs as crucial components of tomorrow’s financial infrastructure.

Title: Full Speed Ahead: It’s Been a Fast-Paced Year for Nonbanks

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy While the rise of alternative lenders and debt funds has created buzz around a relatively new side of finance, the industry of private credit really came into its own over the last 12 months. And its activities can be seen all over the Power Finance list. As billions of dollars of commercial real estate assets struggled to be refinanced at maturity, and dozens of construction projects cried out for bridge and senior financing to either get off the ground or sprint across the finish line, private credit emerged in 2024 as a flexible, and dependable, source of capital. “It’s been an incredible positive for the industry, and the amount of liquidity that’s come in, on the credit side, is staggering, and it’s clearly coming from the debt funds,” said Tom Traynor, vice chairman and co-head of large loans at CBRE (CBRE). The numbers don’t lie. Between 2013 and 2023, U.S. private credit — corporate and real estate loans originated by private, nonbank lenders — grew from $141 billion to $853 billion, according to the financial data provider Preqin. The number now stands at $1.7 trillion, and BlackRock predicts that the global private credit market will double over the next five years and reach $3.5 trillion by 2030. Private credit used to be limited to a few, select opportunity funds financing mezzanine pieces, but today this industry finances the full spectrum of commercial real estate assets and deals in highly complex loan packages. Moreover, alternative lenders believe they can offer their borrowers services that banks either can’t do or won’t provide, particularly speed of execution and the ability to take over stalled projects and foreclosures due to their vertically integrated structure. “There’s a whole slew of borrowers for whom bank financing just doesn’t make sense. There’s not enough proceeds, and they can’t go high enough in leverage,” explained Marcello Cricco-Lizza, principal of global commercial real estate at Balbec Capital. “Whereas, we can add higher leverage on our loans, and have the sophistication to take over those properties and work them out that banks don’t have.” And, while commercial banks still dominate the global credit space, many traditional lenders have decided it’s wiser to join up with the debt funds rather than to simply fight them for clients. This has created an entire industry of “lender financing,” where banks lend to debt funds to get their hands on the biggest CRE deals out there. Through warehouse-type facilities and repurchase structures (repos) — which include note-on-note finances, joint venture uni-trench loans, and single-asset repos — the banks have been able to originate safer CRE loans that receive better capital treatment and that place balance sheet risk in the hands of safer sponsors. Scott Rechler, chairman of RXR, argued that banks like to be lenders to nonbanks due to the favorable credit treatment and the better collateral, as well as the fact that whole loans provided to the funds are often broken up to disentangle risk — which is also easier for borrowers to live with. “What we’re finding is an interesting simpatico, where everyone is finding their home and it works for all pieces,” said Rechler.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: 100 days into Trump's economy, one thing's clear: Americans are worried

Good morning. Mark Carney's Liberal Party is projected to win the election in Canada. Celebrating the victory, Carney had a message for his supporters: "As I've been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never." In today's big story, it's the 100th day since President Donald Trump took office again. BI explored how people feel, how markets have changed, and what tariffs could mean for what's coming next. What's on deck Markets: Five charts show how Elon Musk and Tesla have fared since Trump took office. Tech: ChatGPT has a flattery problem. Sam Altman says a fix is coming. Business: Walmart is America's favorite grocer, but don't underestimate Costco. But first, what a wild start. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. He's been busy. He issued a blizzard of executive orders. He launched an unprecedented global trade war and gutted large swaths of the federal government. He spoke about annexing Greenland, taking control of the Panama Canal, and making Canada the 51st state. The first 100 days of Trump's second term can be defined by one word: uncertainty. Consumers don't appear to like it. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has declined every month this year — and it may deteriorate further once the full effects of tariffs take hold, a Moody's Analytics economist told BI. Peek at it through your fingers if you must — the chart above is a scary one: the S&P 500's start to the year. After Trump announced new tariffs on April 2, the stock market suffered a historic sell-off. The index then somewhat recovered, only to dip again on April 16 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of higher inflation and slower economic growth — the dreaded stagflation scenario. Through it all, one chart climbs higher: the US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which has almost doubled since January. Predicting what comes next is a tall order, but implementing tariffs could result in a surge in inflation and more stock sell-offs, BI's Madison Hoff and Matthew Fox write. More reorganization in the federal government could also mean more job seekers for fewer positions, sending unemployment higher. BI examined sentiment data, markets chaos, and interviews with small business owners, consumers, and economists. They point toward one thing: Americans are worried. 1. This week is going to be huge for the stock market. Investors will get new data on inflation, the labor market, and economic growth, while four of the Magnificent Seven are set to report earnings. Each event could majorly shift markets. 2. How Tesla has suffered from Elon Musk's MAGA moment. Tesla's stock price is down 43% since its mid-December peak, and Musk's net worth has plunged by some $150 billion. Five charts show how the car company and its CEO have fared since Trump took office. 3. When could a recession happen? Apollo's chief economist outlined how Trump's tariffs — especially duties on Chinese goods — could kick off a downturn, with effects starting as soon as next month. 1. Big Law is losing top talent to AI startups. Disillusioned with Big Law's heavy workloads and the long road to partner, young attorneys are betting on AI legal-tech startups instead. Startups offer stock options and flexible work, but they still can't match Big Law salaries. 2. Activists want Meta's receipts on content moderation. Anti-hate groups are pressing Meta shareholders to back a new proposal that includes a report on how Meta handles hate speech. Meta's board has urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. 3. ChatGPT can be a major suck-up. Recent updates have led ChatGPT to really hype up users, sparking debates about whether the behavior is a growth strategy or an "emergent" feature. Here's what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had to say. 1. Domino's delivery bites the dust. Domino's delivery sales fell 1.5% in Q1 as its carryout sales rose 1%, suggesting customers opted for pickup to save money. It could signal a coming change in delivery trends as recession fears rise. 2. Walmart still reigns as America's grocery king. For the third year running, more than one in five dollars spent on groceries in the US goes to Walmart, according to consumer analytics firm Numerator. But Costco is rapidly gaining ground despite the competition. 3. A federal judge seems poised to hand Big Law another win. DOJ attorney Richard Lawson argued that Trump's executive order targeting the firm Jenner & Block wasn't illegal. A federal judge wasn't having it, calling Lawson's interpretation "a pretty strange reading." The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Title: Hims & Hers strikes a deal with Novo Nordisk to sell Wegovy — and the stock soars 28%

Telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS-6.09%) announced Tuesday that it will begin selling Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.61%) blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy. The San Francisco-based company will begin offering the prescription semaglutide on its platform later this week, with a price point starting at $599. Shares of Hims & Hers soared as much as 36% in premarket trading Tuesday before opening up 28% from Monday’s close. Novo Nordisk stock was up 3% at the open. “Bringing our teams together and continuing to explore our shared commitment and focus on delivering the future of healthcare has been inspiring,” Hims & Hers founder and CEO Andrew Dudum said in a statement. “We share a vision of what consumer-centered healthcare looks like, and this is just the first step towards delivering that future.” Customers with a prescription will be able to have the weight loss drug shipped directly to their homes. Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic, on Tuesday announced similar partnerships with telehealth platforms Ro and Life MD (LFMD-14.39%). The prices for a Wegovy prescription will vary across the platforms since they might be bundled with other telehealth services. The Danish pharma giant framed the deals as a way to expand its customer base as the federal government cracks down on compounded versions of Wegovy. Pharmacies can make customized versions of drugs that are considered by the Food and Drug Administration to be in shortage, but the FDA declared in February that the semaglutide shortage was over. “We felt it was really important to work hard to establish a collaboration with telehealth companies so that there could be access to Wegovy as the compounding is winding down,” Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk’s executive vice president of U.S. operations, told CNBC. “We’re really pleased about the level of interest to access branded Wegovy and to start to sort of catch people as they come off of compounded medicine.” Pharma companies including Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%) have taken legal action against compounding pharmacies in recent weeks. Last week, a federal judge in Texas rejected a bid by some of those pharmacies to keep making the drugs while a legal challenge moves forward. Shares of Hims & Hers are up 38% this year. Novo Nordisk stock is down 26%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Amazon Reportedly Pushing Suppliers for Discounts to Combat Tariffs

Amazon is reportedly looking for steep supplier discounts to offset the cost of U.S. tariffs. As the Financial Times (FT) reported Tuesday (April 29), the tech giant has asked for low double-digit price decreases from merchants in a range of categories, from homeware to consumer electronics. That’s according to a trio of vendor consultants who negotiate on behalf of brands and suppliers. They say Amazon has become more aggressive with suppliers getting goods from China in the wake of the White House’s 145% tariffs on China. “Amazon is the 800-pound gorilla in the room,” Scott Miller, a consultant and former Amazon vendor manager, told the FT. “Brands have grown dependent on the platform and have little choice.” The FT notes that Amazon has joined competitors such as Costco and Walmart in leaning on suppliers to reduce the impact on its profits this year. Goldman Sachs analysts said the tariffs could shave between $5 billion and $10 billion from Amazon’s operating profits this year, depending on the outcome of the trade war. A number of logistics providers and analysts told the FT that Amazon had brought forward shipments after Trump took office in anticipation of increased tariffs. The company also canceled a significant amount of direct imports from China and had switched to purchasing goods from suppliers with American stock, according to two consultants. PYMNTS has contacted Amazon for comment but has not received a reply. The company told the FT it was “working with our broad, varied range of valued selling partners in our store to support them in adapting to the developing environment while maintaining low prices for customers.” The news follows reports from earlier this week that Amazon third-party vendors are choosing to skip this year’s Prime Day sales event due to the tariffs. Meanwhile, new research from PYMNTS Intelligence finds that in the battle between Amazon and rival Walmart, many consumers are opting to patronize both retailers. The research found that nearly a quarter of American adults hold subscriptions to Amazon and Walmart’s membership programs, nearly double 2021’s level. Dual memberships are even more pronounced among millennials, at almost 40%. “The enduring image of Walmart as mainly a grocer and purveyor of basic household goods — and of Amazon as the seller of everything else — is being subtly challenged by the rise of the kaleidoscope consumer seeking savings and satisfaction across both marketplaces, often simultaneously,” PYMNTS wrote in advance of the research.

Title: Three Zones Of Safety For Investors In Uncertain Times

ByRob Kaplan ByRob Kaplan, Contributor. Demonstrators hold a banner reading "Climate Justice" during a mass climate march to demand urgent ... More action on the climate crisis from world leaders attending the COP25 summit, in Madrid, on December 6, 2019. - The main march takes place in Madrid on the sidelines of the UN climate conference, with a simultaneous rally in the Chilean capital, which had been due to host the 12-day gathering but was forced to pull out due to deadly anti-government protests. (Photo by GABRIEL BOUYS / AFP) (Photo by GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP via Getty Images) Could now be a moment of opportunity for investors looking to make money and a positive impact? That idea may sound nutty amid unprecedented uncertainty and a dramatic rise in anti-environment rhetoric and actions in the macro environment. If you’re spooked by the headlines, you’re not alone. But once you cut through the noise, opportunities reveal themselves and the reality starts to look a bit different. While the language around climate commitments may be shifting, many of the most influential players, from institutional investors to global corporates, are continuing undeterred. The commitments remain. The capital is still flowing. And for investors willing to look beyond the political theater, there is absolutely a way forward — possibly an even more lucrative one. Yes, uncertainty is in the air. But here are three zones of safety I believe can weather the pushback and continue to deliver strong returns in the sustainability space. 1. Sustainability agendas are global and will continue to drive investment opportunities. Asia is a case in point. It’s not all about the United States. While climate and DEI are being leveraged for political points in the West, the demand for solutions to our greatest social and environmental challenges continues to grow. And here, the rest of the world has an opportunity to step up and fill in the gap. Asia is a case in point. As we look forward, GDP in Asia is outpacing the rest of the world. Vietnam (6%), Indonesia (5.2%), and India (7%) are projected to be among the world’s fastest-growing economies in 2025, according to the IMF. Unlike stagnating developed markets, the region provides a clearer long-term growth trajectory, supported by rising consumer demand, a burgeoning middle class, and sustained infrastructure investment. This growth has drawn increasing attention from global investors. In January 2025, responsAbility Investments secured over $350 million for its Asia Climate Strategy, with more than half coming from private sector investors. Just earlier this month, ABC Impact, a Singapore-based private equity firm focused on Asia, closed its second fund at over $600 million, with clean energy and climate resilience among its core focus areas. Climate-focused funds in the region are gaining traction, underscoring the appetite for both impact and market-rate returns. At the same time, many investors are starting to question preconceived notions about the risks of emerging markets. In today’s environment, the traditional view that developed markets are inherently “safer” no longer holds. Achieving strong returns in the U.S. and Europe increasingly means navigating high corporate debt levels, currently around 80% of GDP in the U.S., slower economic growth, and policy uncertainty. By contrast, high-growth markets in Asia offer not only stronger fundamentals, but also greater resilience. That’s why more investors are turning to the Asian market: not just for upside potential, but as part of a more balanced and forward-looking risk management strategy. A recent study by the GIIN on the state of impact investing in Asia found that there is a growing opportunity for impact investors to use private capital to support these economies. To be clear, these are market-rate investments that should be of particular interest to Asia-focused investors, 76% of whom are focused on risk-adjusted, market-return investments. Look at companies like Renew Power in India, which has grown from a small startup into one of the country’s largest renewable energy companies with over 12 GW of operational capacity and backing from global investors like Goldman Sachs. Or consider Indonesia’s GoTo, which is rapidly transitioning its massive ride-hailing fleet to electric vehicles while building the charging infrastructure to support it. Thailand’s Energy Absolute has evolved from a biodiesel producer into a vertically integrated clean energy powerhouse spanning solar farms, EV manufacturing, and battery production. These aren't charity cases — they're market-driven opportunities that happen to be solving critical sustainability challenges. 2. The climate transition can’t be rolled back, but the reputational calculus has changed Climate investing is here to stay. Yes, U.S.-based asset managers (hello, BlackRock) may be getting cold feet, and even in Europe, there are signs they may consider watering down some of their sustainability requirements for corporations working in the Eurozone. But everyone should take a deep breath. The pushback is already getting pushback. The FT has already reported that large U.K.-based pension funds are sticking to their climate commitments and challenging asset managers who are walking back their climate commitments. That’s significant. These pensions are ultimately accountable to their constituents, and funds like Brunel Pension and Nest are making it clear: climate alignment still matters, and they expect their managers to course-correct. Similarly, TPG’s Tim Coulter recently went on record that his firm is bullish on impact and expected them to ramp up their fundraising for climate-related strategies. When one of private equity's most successful investors sees opportunity in climate, it's worth paying attention. Perhaps more importantly, while public equity sustainability strategies faced outflows in the first quarter, the private markets are telling a different story. Capital is coming back into key areas of the sustainability space, especially through venture and private equity. PitchBook data shows that VC and PE firms poured more than $5 billion into climate-tech startups across the US in the first quarter, up 65% from the previous year. As for multinational corporates, many are discovering that aspirational climate talk no longer earns reputational points, not if it’s not backed up by meaningful action. The reputational value of saying the right thing has flipped; the cost of failing to deliver is now higher than the benefit of making bold but unsubstantiated promises. Just look at BlackRock: Larry Fink’s climate positioning earned the firm goodwill, until it became clear that those values weren’t fully embedded in strategy. That made it all too easy to walk them back when the political winds shifted. When it comes to multinational corporates, they have global commitments that are going to be hard to pare back. They do, after all, need to factor in climate risk to their business strategies. In fact, leaders coming out of Davos in January expressed conviction that many global corporates are sticking to their knitting when it comes to their net-zero and other climate commitments. What we’ll see next isn’t more big climate pledges. It’s deeper integration of climate strategies into business models, and a stronger focus on tangible results. That’s where capital will go, and where value will be created. 3. Opportunities to invest in the circular economy and materials transition will continue to ramp up. The transition toward circular economy business models represents one of the most undervalued investment opportunities in the sustainability space, particularly in emerging markets where growth equity can capture outsized returns. Why? Because future growth rates for critical materials are expected to significantly outpace historical patterns across all demand scenarios, especially in absolute terms. This demand is fueled by an increasingly complex global trade picture, thanks to trade wars and tariffs, pushing domestic and local / regional trade to the fore. There’s a massive gap between corporate commitments and the actual availability of circular solutions across multiple material streams. This disconnect is global but especially pronounced in high-growth markets where recycling value chains remain highly fragmented — a perfect opportunity for investors who understand both sustainability and supply chain dynamics. Take packaging as just one example. Demand for plastic packaging continues climbing steadily, driven partly by a preference for plastics' short use-cycle and pervasive nature. This demand is fueling the need for more sustainable packaging solutions as efforts to increase circular plastic systems and develop effective recycling systems continue to grow. But similar opportunities exist across textiles, construction materials, e-waste, and other consumer goods. With circular business models still in their infancy across most sectors, investors have a singular opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Companies that can establish early leadership in creating high-quality recycled materials at scale will likely become acquisition targets for major packaging companies desperate to drive resiliency in their supply chains. Political winds will always shift, but the fundamental drivers of sustainability investments — resource scarcity, climate risk, consumer demand, and corporate commitments — aren't going away. Smart investors are looking beyond the headlines to identify opportunities where these forces create market inefficiencies they can capitalize on. The three zones I’ve outlined — global sustainability investments (particularly in Asia), climate transition commitments from institutional investors and corporates, and the materials transition — represent areas where capital can find both impact and returns regardless of political rhetoric. For investors willing to take a slightly contrarian stance in today’s environment, these zones of safety might not just offer protection — they could provide some of the most compelling risk-adjusted returns of the decade. Sometimes the best investments are made when others are running scared.

UPS announced Tuesday it would lay off 20,000 workers this year, despite beating first-quarter profit estimates, as the shipping giant expects a decline in deliveries after cutting its shipments for Amazon in half earlier this year. The shipping giant halved its deliveries for Amazon earlier this year. UPS expects to save $3.5 billion in 2025 after cutting 20,000 jobs and closing 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June, the company announced in its first-quarter earnings report. The layoffs and building closures follow what UPS said is “anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer,” Amazon, which UPS announced in January would have its shipping volume with the company cut in half by 2026. UPS—whose shares rose about 1% in premarket trading on Tuesday—reported first-quarter revenue of $21.5 billion and an adjusted profit per share of $1.49, beating analyst expectations of $21.05 billion and $1.38, according to FactSet. The shipping giant pulled its full-year guidance, despite earlier forecasting revenue of $89 billion for its current fiscal year, while citing the “current macro-economic uncertainty.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

The latest layoffs at UPS follow the company’s announcement in January it would cut most of its business with Amazon. At the time, UPS projected a decline in revenue for 2025 as CEO Carol Tome said it was “time to step back for a moment and reassess our relationship” with Amazon. The company’s decision to reduce shipment volume from Amazon will allow UPS to expand its profit margins, Tome said in the company’s 2024 fourth-quarter earnings call. “Amazon is our largest customer, but it’s not our most profitable customer,” Tome said. UPS announced in January 2024 the company would cut 12,000 employees, after Tome said UPS experienced a “difficult and disappointing” 2023.

Title: A Vanishing $212M Bitcoin Order Caused Chaos for Traders. Is Spoofing Back in Crypto?
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/04/29/a-vanishing-usd212m-bitcoin-order-caused-chaos-for-traders-is-spoofing-back-in-crypto
Time Published: 2025-04-29T13:06:04Z
Full Content:
On April 14, someone put in a sell order for 2,500 bitcoin, worth roughly $212 million, on the Binance order book at $85,600, around 2-3% above the spot prices trading at the time. Seeing such a large order, the bitcoin price started to gravitate to this level at around 17:00 UTC. Suddenly, the order was gone, as seen using Coin Glass data, which caused a brief moment of market apathy as bulls and bears tussled to fill a void in liquidity. The bitcoin price at the time, however, was already on shaky ground due to geopolitical concerns. Subsequently, it went lower after the vanishing order caused chaos for the traders. So what happened? One answer could be an illegal technique that involves placing a large limit order to rile trading activity and then removing the order once the price comes close to filling it. This is called "order spoofing," defined by the 2010 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act as "the illegal practice of bidding or offering with the intent to cancel before execution." As seen in the liquidity heatmap in the image above, on the surface, the order with a price of $85,600 seemed like a key area of resistance, which is why market prices started to gravitate towards it. However, in reality, that order and liquidity were likely spoofed, giving traders the illusion of a stronger market. Liquidity heatmaps visualize an order book on an exchange and show how much of an asset rests on the book at each price point. Traders will use a heatmap to identify areas of support and resistance or even to target and squeeze under-pressure positions. In this particular case, the trader seemed to have placed a possible spoof order when the U.S. equity market was closed, usually a time period of low liquidity for the 24/7 bitcoin market. The order was then removed when the U.S. market opened as the price moved towards filling it. This could still have had the desired effect, as, for instance, a large order on one exchange might spur traders or algorithms on another exchange to remove their order, creating a void in liquidity and subsequent volatility. Another reason could be that the trader placing a $212 million sell order on Binance wanted to create short-term sell pressure to get filled on limit buys, and then they removed that order once those buys were filled. Both options are plausible, albeit still illegal. Former ECB analyst and current managing director of Oak Security, Dr. Jan Philipp, told CoinDesk that manipulative trading behavior is a "systemic vulnerability, especially in thin, unregulated markets." "These tactics give sophisticated actors a consistent edge over retail traders. And unlike TradFi, where spoofing is explicitly illegal and monitored, crypto exists in a gray zone." He added that "spoofing needs to be taken seriously as a threat as it helped trigger the 2010 Flash Crash in traditional markets, which erased almost $1 trillion in market value." Binance, meanwhile, insists that it is playing its part in preventing market manipulation. "Maintaining a fair and orderly trading environment is our top priority and we invest in internal and external surveillance tools that continuously monitor trading in real-time, flagging inconsistencies or patterns that deviate from normal market behavior," a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk, without directly addressing the case of the vanishing $212 million order. The spokesperson added that if anyone is found manipulating markets, it will freeze accounts, report suspicious activity to regulators, or remove bad actors from its platform. Spoofing, or a strategy that mimics a fake order, is illegal, but for a young industry such as crypto, history is rife with such examples. During 2014, when there was little to no regulatory oversight, the majority of trading volume took place on bitcoin-only exchanges from retail traders and cypherpunks, opening the industry to such practices. During 2017's ICO phase, when trading volume skyrocketed, tactics such as spoofing were also expected, as institutions were still skeptical about the asset class. In 2017 and 2018, traders regularly placed nine-figure positions that they had no intention of filling, only to pull the order shortly after. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes said in a 2017 blog post that he "found it incredible" that spoofing was illegal. He argued that if a smart trader wanted to buy $1 billion of BTC, they would bluff a $1 billion sell order to get it filled. However, since the 2021 bull market, the crypto market has experienced waves of institutional adoption, such as Coinbase (COIN) going public, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) going all-in on bitcoin, and BlackRock launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the time of writing, there are no such large orders that indicate further spoofing attempts, and spoofing attempts have seemed to have become less blatant. However, even with billions traded by TradFi firms, examples of such a strategy still exist across many crypto exchanges, particularly on low-liquidity altcoins. For example, last month, cryptocurrency exchange MEXC announced that it had reined in a rise in market manipulation. An internal investigation found a 60% increase in market manipulation attempts from Q4 of 2024 to this first quarter of this year. In February, a trader manipulated the HyperLiquid JELLY market by tricking a pricing oracle, and HyperLiquid's response to the activity was met with skepticism and a subsequent outflow of capital. The burden ultimately lies with the exchanges and regulators. "Regulators should set the baseline," Dr. Jan Philipp told CoinDesk." [Regulators] should define what counts as manipulation, specify penalties and outline how platforms must respond." The regulators have certainly tried to clamp down on such schemes. In 2020, rogue trader Avi Eisenberg was found guilty of manipulating decentralized exchange Mango Markets in 2022, but the cases have been few and far between. However, crypto exchanges must also "step up their surveillance systems" and use circuit breakers while employing stricter listing requirements to clamp down on market manipulation, Philipp said. "Retail users won't stick around if they keep getting front-run, spoofed and dumped on. If crypto wants to outgrow its casino phase, we need infrastructure that rewards fair participation, not insider games," Philipp concluded.

Let’s talk about something likely on your mind if you’re a creative professional right now. Things feel… different, don’t they? It seems many graphic designers struggle today, maybe more than ever before. You’re likely feeling the pressure from multiple angles. There’s the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, which seems to be everywhere, promising lightning-fast design outputs. Simultaneously, the global economy feels uncertain, partly due to ongoing trade tensions that affect everything from client budgets to material costs. It’s a challenging combination, creating a genuine sense of unease for many in the design field. Perhaps you’ve noticed clients tightening their belts or asking for more work for the same budget. Maybe you’ve experimented with AI tools yourself, wondering how they fit into your workflow, or if they might eventually replace parts of it. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a significant shift impacting how designers work, find clients, and demonstrate value. The core issue is that the landscape is changing fast. What worked reliably just a few years ago might not be enough anymore. So, what can you, as a talented graphic designer, actually do about it? How can you navigate these choppy waters and steer your career or business back towards stability and success? This article explores the specific challenges graphic designers face and offers practical, actionable strategies to adapt, innovate, and ultimately thrive in this new era. It’s undeniable: the ground is shifting beneath the feet of many creative professionals. The reasons graphic designers struggle aren’t down to just one factor, but rather a confluence of powerful forces reshaping the industry. Let’s break down these key pressures. First off, there’s the elephant in the room: Artificial Intelligence. Generative AI tools like Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, and even integrated features within the entire Adobe Creative Cloud family are becoming incredibly sophisticated. They can generate mood boards, create mockups, draft marketing copy, and produce unique illustrations based on simple text prompts. For routine tasks, this automation offers incredible efficiency gains, allowing teams to iterate much faster than before. And some former clients think they can just handle their entire company branding themselves these days with tools like Adobe Express or Canva—let’s not even start on the design fails that usually follow. However, this very efficiency poses a threat. It encroaches on services often considered entry-level or commoditized – basic layouts, simple illustrations, template-based work. Why would a client pay a premium for a straightforward social media graphic if an AI tool can generate a dozen options in minutes for a fraction of the cost, or even for free? This leads to significant downward pressure on pricing for volume-based projects. The ease with which non-designers can now generate “good enough” visuals means the perceived value of some traditional graphic design tasks is eroding. This particular aspect is a major contributor to why graphic designers struggle to maintain previous income levels for certain types of work. Alongside the technological disruption, economic uncertainty looms large. Ongoing trade wars and geopolitical tensions create a ripple effect. Businesses become cautious. Marketing budgets, often seen as discretionary spending, are frequently among the first to be scrutinized or reduced when companies anticipate tougher times. This translates directly into fewer projects, smaller project scopes, or clients pushing harder on price negotiations for graphic designers. Furthermore, trade disputes can directly impact the cost of physical goods. Tariffs on materials like paper, ink, and substrates imported from certain regions (e.g., China, EU) drive up the cost of printing. This makes producing brochures, packaging, books, and other print collateral more expensive, squeezing margins for both designers who manage print production and their clients. When costs rise, clients may opt for digital-only solutions or simpler designs, further impacting the type and volume of work available. This economic pressure compounds the difficulties, making the graphic designers’ struggle feel even more acute. There’s another subtle but significant pressure point: evolving client expectations. Increasingly, companies look for creative hires who can do it all – the “one-stop shop” designer. It’s no longer just about static visuals. Clients might expect a graphic designer to also handle motion graphics, basic video editing, social media content creation and management, and perhaps even elements of UX/UI design. While expanding skill sets is valuable, this trend often comes without a corresponding increase in compensation. This “scope creep” means designers are asked to deliver more diverse outputs under the single umbrella of “graphic design,” diluting focus and potentially undervaluing specialized skills. The expectation to be a generalist powerhouse adds another layer to why graphic designers struggle to define their value and charge appropriately. Feeling the pinch? You’re not alone. The combination of AI advancement and economic tightening is genuinely challenging. However, disruption always creates opportunity. The key isn’t to resist the changes but to adapt strategically. Here’s a roadmap with actionable steps for graphic designers looking to transform their business and find renewed success. Instead of viewing AI as purely a threat, consider how you can integrate it into your workflow to enhance your capabilities. The goal is to work smarter, not just harder. AI is great at execution based on prompts, but it lacks genuine understanding, empathy, and strategic foresight. This is where you can truly differentiate yourself. Relying solely on client project work can be precarious in uncertain times. Building diversified revenue streams creates more stability. In an era where AI can generate visuals instantly, your unique perspective, process, and personality become key differentiators. Efficiency isn’t just about design tools; it’s about how you run your business, especially when costs are rising. Look beyond your traditional client base or service offerings. The challenges facing graphic designers today – the rise of capable AI tools and the pressures of an uncertain global economy influenced by trade wars – are significant. It’s understandable why many graphic designers struggle to find their footing in this rapidly evolving landscape. However, these pressures are also catalysts for innovation and growth. The designers who will not only survive but truly thrive are those who embrace adaptability. This means proactively integrating AI as a powerful assistant rather than fearing it as a replacement. It involves doubling down on the uniquely human skills of strategic thinking, empathy, and deep niche expertise where machines cannot compete. Building diversified income streams through digital products and education creates financial resilience. Strengthening your personal brand ensures your unique value is recognized, while optimizing your operations and exploring new markets opens up fresh avenues for growth. The future of graphic design isn’t about being replaced; it’s about evolving. By strategically adapting your skills, services, and business model, you can navigate the current headwinds and position yourself for long-term success. The path forward requires learning, experimenting, and perhaps stepping outside your comfort zone, but the potential rewards – a more resilient, valuable, and profitable design career – are well worth the effort. You have the creativity and the capability; now is the time to apply it strategically to your own business. If you’re struggling creatively right now, you’re not alone, and connecting with like-minded folks can help. Join our Reddit Design community! Together, we can make a big difference.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/29/2025 5:25:56 AM PDT by Red Badger The attempts on President Trump’s life were one of the most disturbing and suspicious events in modern political history, especially the one in Butler, Pa. And yet, barely anyone in the media seems interested in asking real questions. They’re not the least bit curious about what happened, and it’s starting to feel like they want us to forget it ever happened. But that’s not going to happen… Thanks to people like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, the curtain is still being yanked back, and what’s behind it should send chills down every American’s spine. From a house scrubbed cleaner than Hillary Clinton’s email server to a shooter with no internet footprint to a random live CNN feed of a rally in the middle of nowhere, the details surrounding the Butler assassination attempt are filled with questions, and at this point, it’s starting to feel like a scandal. Most people don’t believe the “lone wolf” story the media tried to sell us. Many conclude that this was something much darker, and the more you hear about it, the harder it is to ignore that fact. In this powerful chat, Joe and Elon break down just how bizarre and disturbing this entire story really is. They go through the strange facts one by one, from the assassin’s spotless house and missing online life to the shady ties to BlackRock, mind-blowing Secret Service failures, and the suspicious lack of transparency from federal officials. These questions are very serious, yet nobody in power seems willing to answer them. Wall Street Apes: Never stop talking about this Joe Rogan and Elon Musk point out the INSANE details surrounding the Butler, Pennsylvania Donald Trump assassination attempt shooter – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no ... sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. It’s absolutely mind-boggling that a former and now current president could survive two assassination attempts, and the national media hasn’t delved into it. Where are the big New York Times and WAPO investigations that would usually follow such a monumental story? This type of cover-up is what happens when you don’t have a real press. Because when the media stops being honest, corruption festers, propaganda takes over, and the American people are force-fed a diet of lies while the real bad guys stay hidden in the shadows, totally free to plot their next move. And because of this, we can’t stop demanding the truth.

Many conclude that this was something much darker, and the more you hear about it, the harder it is to ignore that fact. In this powerful chat, Joe and Elon break down just how bizarre and disturbing this entire story really is. They go through the strange facts one by one, from the assassin’s spotless house and missing online life to the shady ties to BlackRock, mind-blowing Secret Service failures, and the suspicious lack of transparency from federal officials. These questions are very serious, yet nobody in power seems willing to answer them. Wall Street Apes: Never stop talking about this Joe Rogan and Elon Musk point out the INSANE details surrounding the Butler, Pennsylvania Donald Trump assassination attempt shooter – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no ... sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. It’s absolutely mind-boggling that a former and now current president could survive two assassination attempts, and the national media hasn’t delved into it. Where are the big New York Times and WAPO investigations that would usually follow such a monumental story? This type of cover-up is what happens when you don’t have a real press. Because when the media stops being honest, corruption festers, propaganda takes over, and the American people are force-fed a diet of lies while the real bad guys stay hidden in the shadows, totally free to plot their next move. And because of this, we can’t stop demanding the truth.

Where are the big New York Times and WAPO investigations that would usually follow such a monumental story? This type of cover-up is what happens when you don’t have a real press. Because when the media stops being honest, corruption festers, propaganda takes over, and the American people are force-fed a diet of lies while the real bad guys stay hidden in the shadows, totally free to plot their next move. And because of this, we can’t stop demanding the truth.

Gee, no only yes but Hell yes We haven’t had a real “press” since odongo (2012 or so) repealed the regulation that required them to be honsest. With that repeal, along with change of townships, they bacame nothing but an echo chamber for the communist agenda. Basically, they’re PRAVDA with absolutely no credibility. On top of all that, they stink like the communists that they are. So where’s Bondi and Patel on this? For that matter, where the hell is Trump? Well, “all” that we are permitted to know about. Has anyone seen Maxwell Yearick? We haven’t had a real “press” since 1932................... I don’t watch MSM TV, and only glance at NY Times and WaPo headlines so I am not an expert on their coverage - BUT it seems there has been ZERO media coverage of this guy, his family, his prior movements etc. etc. They are totally disinterested in the punk and his origins, preferring to write him off as a kook, lone wolf, and the fact that he failed.................

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Nearly 15 years ago, Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett teamed up to start the Giving Pledge, which encouraged the super wealthy to donate at least half their fortunes to charity. Since then, it’s gone from 40 members to 245. The group now includes members from 30 countries, though they represent just 8% of the world’s 3,028 billionaires. Ahead of its anniversary, Forbes spoke with five members about why they joined, what they’ve learned and what more they’d like to see happen. “Sooner rather than later I realized that wealth comes with both responsibility and opportunity,” says Rohini Nilekani, who is married to Infosys billionaire Nandan Nilekani. Still, fewer pledgers have joined in recent years, and there’s no way to know how many have actually fulfilled their promise. AFP via Getty Images The stock market has stumbled during President Donald Trump’s first 100 days, but one controversial company is bucking the trend: AI giant and government contractor Palantir, chaired by longtime Trump backer Peter Thiel. The company’s stock has jumped 54% since January 17, the strongest return of any company listed on the S&P 500, though the firm has faced criticism over a $30 million contract with ICE on a program to assist the agency in deportations. The Trump Administration signaled a plan that will indirectly lower tariffs on foreign-made auto parts needed to manufacture cars in the U.S., the Wall Street Journal reported, prompting automaker shares to inch up in premarket trading. While automakers will need to pay 25% tariffs on foreign-made components beginning May 3, a reported tweak to the rule will allow them to seek partial reimbursement for those levies. President Donald Trump said revenue from tariffs may “completely” eliminate income taxes for many people in the U.S., but one economic study said it would be “mathematically impossible.” The Department of Homeland Security has collected $15.86 billion in customs and excise taxes so far in April, an increase of about $6 billion from March, though the White House is still negotiating with other countries, so it’s unclear how much the tariffs will ultimately bring to U.S. coffers. Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images In an interview with The Atlantic, President Donald Trump boasted that he runs “the world” and is “having a lot of fun,” after the publication called his cellphone and he answered. Though Trump has previously criticized the magazine, he touched on several issues, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of the Signal chat app, the alleged deportations of Americans and Silicon Valley’s warming to him. MORE: Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) introduced seven articles of impeachment against Trump on Monday afternoon, saying the president has “ignored the very checks and balances that keep our democracy intact.” The articles are the first formal impeachment effort of Trump's second term, though they are almost certain to fail in Congress. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the decision to deport three children from Louisiana who were U.S. citizens, saying it was their mothers who were deported and chose to take their children with them. “You guys just make it sound like I say, ‘Just kick down the door and grab the 2-year-old’ and threw them on an airplane. That’s misleading, that’s just not true,” Rubio said. Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney has secured a full term in power, and his Liberal Party was projected to win the Canadian national elections Monday. Carney, who won his seat with a comfortable 30-point margin, addressed the tension between Canada and the U.S. in his victory speech, telling supporters that “Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never happen.” Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine from May 8 to 10 while Russia celebrates the end of World War II, as peace talks between the U.S., Ukraine and Russia have dragged on. President Donald Trump has indicated he is losing patience with Putin, and Secretary Rubio signaled recently the U.S. would walk away from the discussions if progress was not made soon. President Donald Trump has long battled with the media, but he’s increasingly using government resources to attack it. As polls published in the last week from outlets like the New York Times, ABC News, the Washington Post and Fox News show him with net negative approval ratings, Trump has called the pollsters “negative criminals.” His administration has elevated right-wing voices in the White House press corps and sought to effectively shut down federally funded media outlets, and new FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr has launched investigations into several outlets. ILLUSTRATION BY CECILIA RUNXI ZHANG FOR FORBES; IMAGES BY GOOGLE GEMINI AI There’s good news for savers in fairly high tax brackets: Yields on municipal bonds are good, comfortably ahead of what you can clear from Treasury bonds. But the bad news is it is easy to be gouged buying either individual bonds or high-fee funds. Municipal bonds are worth considering for any fixed-income money you have in taxable accounts. Patrick Haskell, who oversees a $182 billion pile of them at BlackRock, says: “We haven’t had the opportunity to invest at these levels of real and nominal yields since the financial crisis.” The numbers he has in mind: For bonds due in 10 years, tax-exempt yields are 80% of U.S. Treasury yields, not bad for anyone destined to pay a tax of 20% or more on interest. At the 30-year mark the percentage is close to 100%. There is a catch with the long munis, having to do with the risk they will be called in early, but they remain very attractive even after allowance for this risk. Are you interested in collecting 4% interest federally tax-free? There are too many choices. Fidelity has on its sale counter 138,000 individual tax-exempt bonds. You could get a fund, but even so there is a selection process. YCharts counts 3,700, including all the share classes. On individual bonds our advice is simple: Don’t buy them. As for funds: Forbes narrowed the roster of those worth looking at to 40. WHY IT MATTERS “The U.S. equity market has been volatile and discouraging this year—so investors are looking at making their portfolios more conservative,” says Forbes senior contributor William Baldwin. “Inside an IRA or 401(k) they’d select a taxable bond fund. Outside the tax shelter they often do better by owning a municipal bond fund. The Forbes Fund Finder displays the best ones.” MORE The Market Is Crashing.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement From setting timers to controlling your smart home, here's how Amazon's voice assistant has evolved with new features to make your life easier this spring season. You can use all of these Alexa commands if you have the fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock. Amazon's voice assistant Alexa has evolved far beyond a simple talking speaker. Like Siri on your iPhone, playing music or checking weather updates only scratches the surface of what this technology can accomplish. Today's Alexa can handle sophisticated voice commands, controlling Fire TV devices, managing daily routines and transforming your home into a fully automated smart environment. As we enter spring cleaning season, these capabilities become even more valuable for organizing your home and schedule, especially now with a smarter Alexa Plus with AI-powered features now available. Recent research reveals many users have concerns about these increasingly capable assistants -- a recent CNET survey found 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, though Amazon's Alexa remains the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Title: Economy Likely Grew At Weakest Rate In Nearly 3 Years, Experts Say

As recession fears reverberate from Washington to Wall Street, Wednesday brought the most comprehensive yardstick yet of the health of the U.S. economy yet as the government released the first estimate of the country’s gross domestic product over the first three months of 2025. Some measures tracking U.S. economic activity predict the U.S. economy actually shrank during the ... More first three months of 2025. Pictured is the Port of Long Beach. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew -0.3% on a quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annual rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That is the weakest economic growth for the U.S. since 2022’s first quarter. Consensus economist forecasts pegged last quarter’s real GDP growth at 0.4%, according to Dow Jones data, a stark decrease from the prior period’s 2.4% expansion. Data from sources following underlying measures of economic activity suggested Wednesday’s GDP reading could be even worse than that; the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model called for -0.4% GDP during Q1 when excluding gold imports and exports, while Goldman Sachs’ tracker indicates a 0.2% contraction. The BEA said the negative GDP reading “primarily reflected” an increase in imports, which surged as businesses aimed to front run tariffs, and a decrease in government spending. Futures tied to all three major indexes slid Wednesday morning following the GDP report. Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated a 380-point, or 0.9%, drop for the index, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures declined 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively. Negative GDP growth is rare for the U.S., occurring just three times over the last decade: 2020’s first two quarters as the COVID-19 pandemic ground the global economy to a halt, including a record 28% GDP contraction during the second quarter, and Q1 2022, when the Fed enacted its first interest rate hike in more than three years as inflation soared to a multidecade high. The U.S. will be one step closer to entering a recession, at least by one definition. A technical recession occurs when economic output contracts over consecutive quarters, meaning a negative reading during the second quarter would indicate such a downturn. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” meaning consecutive quarters of slightly negative GDP growth may not officially trigger a recession. Some trusted observers of the economy believe the U.S. could already be on the cusp of a recession, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, while major banks largely view it as a tossup whether or not the U.S. enters such a downturn, including the U.S.’ largest bank JPMorgan Chase, whose economists forecast a 60% chance of a recession this year. The GDP reading comes as economists debate the growing disconnect between “hard” and “soft” economic metrics. Hard data such as job growth and retail sales indicate a steady economy while survey-based measures reveal Americans’ faith in the economy has dropped precipitously, as the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment poll revealed the weakest sentiment since July 2022. The disconnect comes as Trump has pursued the most aggressive tariffs since before World War I during the early stages of his second term. The ever-changing nature of Trump’s trade stances have also complicated analysis of the regularly scheduled updates on the U.S. economy. For example, this week’s GDP reading includes data through March 31 – two days before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement which triggered historic stock market losses, and nine days before Trump backpedaled on many of his most aggressive country-by-country import taxes. “Tariffs function like a tax hike, tighten financial conditions, and increase uncertainty for businesses,” Goldman economists led by David Mericle wrote in a Sunday note to clients, explaining how the levies weigh on GDP growth.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A powerful force is dominating the Trump economy: fear. About two-thirds (66%) of adults say they are pessimistic or afraid about the economy, according to new findings from a CNN/SSRS poll released Monday. Just 34% say they feel enthusiastic or optimistic. The overwhelming majority – 69% – consider an economic recession in the next year to be at least somewhat likely, including 32% who say it’s very likely. This sense of dread in the first 100 days of the second Trump presidency isn’t just a political problem for the White House. It’s also a psychological problem for an economy that requires consumer spending to stay afloat. This raises the risk of a recession becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Fear of a recession causes Americans to shop less and save more. Vacations aren’t booked. Cars aren’t purchased. Restaurants aren’t full. CEOs, worried about consumers hunkering down, do the same. They hire fewer and fire more. And that causes consumers to pull back even further, prompting even more layoffs. It can become a negative feedback loop that is hard to break. The economy and financial markets are a confidence game – one that has been shaken by President Donald Trump’s trade war and sweeping April 2 tariff announcement, attacks on Federal Reserve independence and chaotic policymaking. “April 2nd was a turning point. It’s been four weeks of chaos, and the chaos has been disruptive. We are beginning to pay the price for it,” said David Kotok, co-founder of ﻿investment management firm Cumberland Advisors. It’s clear that consumer sentiment has been dropping. The CNN poll found that seven in 10 of those under the age of 45 express pessimism or fear about the economy. So do 76% of Americans of color. And it’s true that Democrats are more pessimistic than Republicans about the state of affairs. But the CNN poll found bipartisan economic concerns, with 39% of those who voted for Trump in 2024 saying a recession is very or somewhat likely in the next year. Still, it’s far too early to know if the turbulence in financial markets will short-circuit the economic expansion that began after the Covid-19 pandemic crash. It’s entirely possible that weak consumer confidence does not cause a drop in consumer spending. That’s exactly what happened in 2022, a time when many consumers and economists were similarly sounding the recession alarm – only to be proven wrong. The US economy has proven very resilient. It shook off multiple Covid variants, the supply chain mess, the inflation crisis and the regional bank failures of 2023. And so far this year, there isn’t much evidence that Americans have stopped spending. Retail sales jumped and car sales surged in March as consumers tried to beat the clock on tariffs. Restaurant reservations on OpenTable are higher than a year ago. And it’s possible that the massive rebound in US stocks after Trump delayed country-specific tariffs for 90 days could improve the mood on main street as it did on Wall Street. Weak confidence among consumers could interrupt the business cycle. “A lot of businesses are getting nervous. They could pause spending or cut back on travel and hiring. And that’s what could make this a self-fulfilling prophecy,” David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNN in a phone interview. Consider that 81% of small toy companies and 87% of mid-sized toy companies are delaying orders due to tariffs, according to an April survey by the Toy Association, a trade group. That same survey found that almost half of all small- and mid-sized toy makers say they will go out of business within weeks or months. “We are starting to see the first signs of the supply chain breakdown from tariffs. My expectation is that it will worsen,” said Kotok, who pointed to a surge of container ships sitting offshore and canceled sailings. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently said many business leaders fear the US economy is already in a recession, and JPMorgan’s Kelly said he is most concerned about how CEOs will respond to economic worries. Just last week, Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan highlighted most severe drop in domestic leisure travel outside of the pandemic, telling Bloomberg News: “I don’t care if you call it a recession or not, in this industry, that’s a recession.” Kelly said it may be a “shallow” recession but “the odds still favor us slipping into recession unless we see a sharp about-face on tariffs.” Torsten Slok, chief economist at investment firm Apollo Global Management, goes a step further, saying there is a 90% chance of a “voluntary trade reset recession.” “Expect ships to sit offshore, orders to be canceled, and well-run generational retailers to file for bankruptcy,” Slok wrote earlier this month in a report. Jared Bernstein, a top economist for President Joe Biden during the last recession scare in 2022, cautioned against assuming a recession is inevitable. “We’ve gone through years of bad vibes and good data. We have to be careful not to over-torque on this,” Bernstein told CNN in a phone interview. Still, Bernstein sees a roughly 50/50 chance of a US recession because of the stagflationary shock from tariffs, which are expected to simultaneously slow the economy and increase prices. The policy whiplash is also a problem. “Even if we believe (Trump) will dial back the trade war,” Bernstein said, “how confident can we be that he won’t dial back his dial-back the next day?” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Arun Kumar, vice-president and head of research at FundsIndia, has a distinct style of investing in mutual funds, one that leans heavily on value investing. Around 55% of his portfolio is parked in funds that follow a value style of investing. In an interaction withMintfor the Guru Portfolio series, Kumar shared his contrarian approach when it comes to picking mutual funds for his portfolio. “I like it when certain investment styles or investment approaches are not doing well," he says. What has changed in your portfolio in the last one year?I have always been equity-heavy. Currently, my portfolio is 90% equity, and the remaining 10% is in debt and arbitrage funds. I’m comfortable with this because my wife and I have active income and contribute 10-15% of the portfolio value each year. Even during bear markets, we contribute to the portfolio. However, as our portfolio grows over time, our savings might not catch up with it. There will be a time when our portfolios will become so big that we’ll not be able to add meaningfully (less than 5%) to our portfolios. At that time, I will shift to a more conservative portfolio and keep it 70% equity, 15% gold, and 15% debt and debt-like investments. How is your equity portion bifurcated?A chunk of my portfolio, 55%, is in four funds. I have a natural bias towards value investing as a style and have invested in funds that fund managers manage with a value bias. It’s split across Sankaran Naren’s ICICI India Opportunities, Rajeev Thakkar's PPFAS FlexiCap, Kenneth Andrade’s Old Bridge focused equity fund, and HDFC FlexiCap, which Prashant Jain earlier managed. Another 15% of our portfolio is to make slightly concentrated bets. I am bullish on banking as a sector and put all this portion in one banking stock. I feel that the NPA cycle has been cleaned up, and the credit growth cycle is about to start. Banks also have a strong balance sheet because they had over-prepared for covid, but the impact wasn’t as bad as we thought. Banking is a good sector going through a bad time with decent valuations, and I’m hoping for a reversal in the future. The other 15% is spread across the globe. I had taken a bet in Chinese tech through Mirae’s Hang Seng Tech ETF two years ago. It didn’t do well for some time, but started playing out in the last one year. I also had an SIP in a Nasdaq fund. When the markets crashed in 2022, I built up my position in a FAANG [Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet (formerly Google)] stock, which was part of that index. That stock has gone up 4x, leading to slightly skewed exposure. The remaining 5% is allocated to mid- and small-cap funds. I did not have any allocation to mid- and small-cap before and missed the whole rally. The only exposure I had was indirectly through flexi-cap funds that had some exposure to such companies. I was already too much into equities and didn’t want to get too aggressive. Over time, the plan is to gradually start building the small and mid-cap exposure.

I did not have any funds from that category, and the only allocation I had was through my flexi cap. Learning from this experience, I have now put in place a framework to play small caps. SIP can also be a simple way to build exposure. What additions are you looking to make to your portfolio?I like it when certain investment styles or investment approaches are not doing well. Lately, momentum-oriented funds have not been doing great, and I am looking at it, although I haven’t made up my mind. We also didn’t have many options before, but now we have plenty of them. Quality is another style that has dramatically underperformed in the last four years, and I see some early signs of a turnaround. I am now looking at quality schemes and will slowly build up exposure there. That is what I’ll focus on for the next few months. Can you elaborate on your thesis on the quality theme?Everyone wants high-quality companies with high ROCE (return on capital employed), low debt, consistent earnings, high earnings growth potential, and good management at decent valuations. It’s very difficult to get all of these in one stock. So, quality fund managers usually end up compromising on the valuations front. This overpaying has come to bite them in the past four years. When the markets rebounded, it was a broad-based recovery where all stocks, regardless of their quality, were growing their earnings at a rapid pace, and so there was no need to pay an exorbitant price for quality. But when the market starts going through a tough phase, and only a few good quality companies are winning, that’s when quality starts performing. While it’s tough to time styles, the recent underperformance and the moderating growth environment with a lot of uncertainty thrown in augurs well for quality. Overall, it seems like a good place for quality to start working again. When the tide turns is anybody's guess, but at least it’s crucial to remain consistent with our process. Also Read: Look who's making a comeback: Quality vs value investing What quality scheme are you looking at?I like UTI Flexi cap for sticking to its quality investment style even when it has fallen out of favour. Have you exited any position?I have hardly sold any of my funds since I started seriously investing in 2015. I have redeemed a few small allocations here and there to clean my portfolio. However, I’ve kept all my core holdings. I buy funds mostly by looking at the fund manager. As long as the same fund manager runs the fund, I don’t mind even if it’s underperforming. HDFC Flexi cap is one scheme that I bought due to Prashant Jain, but he left HDFC in 2022. However, I continued holding that scheme because the current manager, Roshi Jain, manages the fund reasonably well. What would make you sell?As a thumb rule, I would contemplate selling when the fund manager changes or there is a significant change or dilution from the stated investment approach. Another aspect is on the performance front. If the returns deteriorate and I am not able to understand the reason behind it, then that can be an issue. But let’s say a fund manager who follows a quality style is underperforming, and all others with the same style and index are also struggling; then it’s okay. In this case, underperformance is not an issue. In fact, I bought most of my schemes when the fund manager was underperforming. In contrast, if you’re following a certain style and are performing poorly when others following the same style are doing well, then that's a sign to sell out.

Everyone wants high-quality companies with high ROCE (return on capital employed), low debt, consistent earnings, high earnings growth potential, and good management at decent valuations. It’s very difficult to get all of these in one stock. So, quality fund managers usually end up compromising on the valuations front. This overpaying has come to bite them in the past four years. When the markets rebounded, it was a broad-based recovery where all stocks, regardless of their quality, were growing their earnings at a rapid pace, and so there was no need to pay an exorbitant price for quality. But when the market starts going through a tough phase, and only a few good quality companies are winning, that’s when quality starts performing. While it’s tough to time styles, the recent underperformance and the moderating growth environment with a lot of uncertainty thrown in augurs well for quality. Overall, it seems like a good place for quality to start working again. When the tide turns is anybody's guess, but at least it’s crucial to remain consistent with our process.

Title: Chokepoint Crazy: The U.S. Bombs Both Sides of Gulf of Aden and Considers Setting Up Shop in Somaliland

Time Published: 2025-04-29T10:00:57Z
Full Content:
The bombing of Yemen is hogging most of the attention, but the US is also dramatically upping its airstrikes across the Gulf of Aden in Somalia as Washington struggles to fulfill goals of dominating key shipping chokepoints. We’ve seen the Trump administration lean on Greenland, Panama, and Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings to sell its dozens of global ports to a consortium that includes BlackRock. And then there’s the intensification of bombings in Somalia and Yemen. That’s not going so well, as the US Navy losing an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to Houthi fire on Sunday demonstrates. Yet, the US is likely to continue doubling down in the region as it has been doing. According to the neocon Foundation for Defense of Democracies, “in just the first three months of President Donald Trump’s second term, his administration has already launched at least 16 manned aircraft or drone strikes inside Somalia, according to numbers compiled by FDD’s Long War Journal. For comparison, the Biden administration only launched 10 such strikes in 2024.” The number of Trump strikes might also be an undercount, since the US military’s Africa Command no longer provides specific details of such operations after the White House greenlit a more liberal policy allowing American commanders to authorize airstrikes and special operation raids outside conventional battlefields, broadening the range of people who can be targeted for death. During his first overseas trip in February, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed the directive easing policy constraints and executive oversight in a meeting with senior U.S. military leaders from AFRICOM in Germany. As the collapsed Horn of Africa country is the recipient of increased violence from the “America First” administration, we’re getting scary stories that “The Islamic State has regrouped in Somalia — and has global ambitions.” As always, the result of US counterterrorism strategy is that terrorism continues to magically spread like wildfire and that the US must bomb Somalia to smithereens in order to prevent ISIS from continuing to spread. It also conveniently coincides with the US’ desire to increase its presence in the Horn of Africa with an eye towards a battle over Red Sea shipping. Samar Al-Bulushi and Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim writing at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft believe this is the case: It is a clear indication of the growing geopolitical significance of the Horn of Africa, and comes at a time of mounting concerns (mostly attempts by Yemen’s Houthis to disrupt global shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza) about securing the flow of international commerce via the Red Sea. And American international commerce should be favored, according to Trump who on Sunday demanded free transit for US ships crossing the Panama and Suez canals. Okay then. What Would Somaliland Provide? There were recently rumors that the US and Israel were considering “relocating” Gazans to Somaliland among other locations, but this ignores the fact that Palestinians do not want to be driven out of their homeland and many would rather die than do so. While it wouldn’t stop Israel or the US, it’s worth mentioning that forced deportation of populations is also a crime against humanity and could be considered genocide under Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. There also haven’t been any serious talks with Somaliland about such a scheme yet with the region’s foreign minister saying that Somalialnd must be on the road to recognition for any such conversations to proceed. Nevertheless, Somaliland is attempting to position itself as a strong US partner by appealing to Washington’s desire to counter Chinese influence. Somalia is countering by upping its offers to the US. Both highlight how the US is desperate to make moves in the region in a bid to control vital shipping lanes and gain an upper hand in what Washington views as a global battle against China. In a March 16 letter, Somalia’s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud offers the US “strategically positioned assets” to “bolster American engagement in the region, ensuring uninterrupted military and logistical access while preventing external competitors from establishing a presence in this critical corridor.” The “assets” are the Berbera port and airbase in Somaliland and the Bosaso port and airbase in Puntland, both of which could be used to monitor and counter Houthi attacks on genocide-friendly commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The problem is that these areas are not under the control of Somalia, which has been blown to bits by multiple warring factions engaged in permanent civil war. Puntland severed ties with Mogadishu last March following years of political disputes.The Islamic State allegedly has a heavy presence in Puntland, and is one of the primary targets of the more frequent US airstrikes, and Bosaso is being transformed into a mega base for the breakaway region’s defense forces attacks against IS. In Somaliland, which occupies approximately 20 percent of Somalia’s territory and is home to about a third of the population, the situation is comparatively peaceful, and the standard of living is much higher. [1] Source: @Dani6CBP Somaliland has been seeking recognition as an independent state for more than three decades, and in 2022 the government there already offered the US access to the Berbera port in exchange for recognition. The Trump administration might jump at the offer in an attempt to combat China. Djibouti and China There is also the issue of China’s military base in Djibouti. The US, Germany, Japan, and Italy all had military presences in Djibouti, but it became a problem when China opened its first foreign military base there in 2017. Beijing’s stated interest — like the others — is to protect its shipping. And according to Responsible Statecraft, “Djibouti is also important for China’s Belt and Road Initiative as a key maritime stop and a new railway line to Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa that connects the countries. China is the largest investor in Djibouti, with a total of $14.4 billion in infrastructure being built, a huge sum for an economy that is only worth $4.67 billion.” For the US, however, it is unacceptable, and Washington became more determined to do something about it when Djibouti denied the US request to use its territory for attacks against the Houthis targeting ships trading with Israel. The US blamed China for Djibouti’s decision. Under Trump, the desperation to counter China is leading to a renewed focus on Somalia and Somaliland: Rather than accept Djibouti’s position, foreign policy experts have sought to escalate tensions, blaming Djibouti for being pro-Houthi and pro-China. Hoping to find a more reliable partner, many propose that the United States recognize and work with Somaliland instead. Somaliland is an unrecognized state that asserted its independence from Somalia in 1991. Close to Yemen and next Somalia, it seems Somaliland offers everything Djibouti has with no strings attached. Project 2025 recommends “the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the U.S.’s deteriorating position in Djibouti.” As Semafor first reported in December, members of the US president’s new team have expressed interest in recognizing Somaliland: The move could enable US intelligence to set up long term operations to monitor the movement of weapons in a volatile region as well as keep an eye on Chinese activity. And in January an influential US-China subcommittee in the US House of Representatives called for the State Department to open a representative office in Somaliland. The increase of US airstrikes in Somalia is likely to only destabilize the situation further, leading to increased calls for Somaliland recognition. Again, the Trump administration is just ramping up existing US policy with a twist. Collective Biden formally upheld Somalia’s territorial integrity, but the Pentagon showed interest in a presence in Berbera, with several visits by Africom officials. Last year, the US signed a deal with the government of Somalia to construct up to five military bases for the Somali National Army in the name of bolstering the army’s capabilities in the ongoing fight against militant groups. The bases are intended for the Danab (“Lightning”) Brigade, a U.S.-sponsored Special Ops Force that was established in 2014. The US at first funded Danab from the State Department, which contracted with private security firm Bancroft Global. More recently, funding comes from the Pentagon’s proxy war fund called the 127e program, which bypasses congressional oversight by allowing US special operations forces to use foreign military units as surrogates in counterterrorism missions. Despite the fact that Somalia receives US aid to pay government salaries, it launched a mega lobbying campaign following Trump’s victory, hiring big time firms like BGR . According to Africa Report, the Somali president is also attempting to win over Elon Musk by giving him a Starlink license to operate in the country. Mogadishu is also going on a Washington lobbyist hiring spree. The US Doesn’t Do Nation Building As Team Trump considers Somaliland recognition, the foreign policy team green lighting strikes in Somalia reportedly believes that state-building there is futile. They’re not necessarily wrong, but what they get right is for the wrong reasons. From Geeska: We are now witnessing the clear unveiling of what remains of the fig leaf that the international community had wrapped itself in when dealing with Somali affairs. This same community had previously imposed a coercive state-building model in Somalia through military interventions and, in 2013, granted sovereign recognition to the Mogadishu government as the legitimate successor of the post-independence Somali Republic. This project later evolved into a system resembling a cottage industry run by a narrow group of experts and opportunistic politicians shuttling between Mogadishu and Nairobi under the guise of constructing a federal governance model, backed by regional forces that are periodically rotated every few years. At its core, however, this process was nothing more than a fragile arrangement to reconcile former warlords, jihadist movement leaders, and local clan politicians. As this model has gradually collapsed over time due to both internal and external factors, the international community now implicitly acknowledges that the Somali Republic no longer exists in practice. What remains is a fragile entity dependent on international donors, African peacekeeping forces and Turkish largesse, which barely exercises control beyond the capital. The Trump administration’s policies serve as a new kind of threat, as it attempts to formalise its engagement with the de facto authorities, sidelining the de jure situation that operates on the assumption that Somalia is a sovereign state, rather than a space where international powers manage threats to their interests. And so the US, having helped destabilize Somalia, might now place its bets on Somaliland. Should it do so, it would be somewhat reminiscent of another state the US blessed with the aim of a military presence and a geoeconomic win. Following the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 Washington helped bring about the creation of Kosovo. While a lot of people in the US profited handsomely from all the death and destruction, Kosovo remains to this day a state on life support. Politico did a piece on the US failure last year and the author was astounded to witness Washington’s failures despite Kosovo’s small size and GDP of just $10 billion — “less than one-quarter the size of Vermont’s, the smallest US state in terms of economic activity.” It’s surprising that the author is surprised. The US can’t even do nation building in the US. What makes anyone think they have any interest in Kosovo or Somaliland aside from the plunder and moves on the Great Game board? Politico does admit that “Washington’s priorities were informed more by short-term American business interests, than providing the country what it really needed to develop.” The US did, however, open Camp Bondsteel. It’s the biggest (almost 1,000 acres) and most expensive US military base built in Europe in 50-plus years. It now sits mostly empty and has earned the nickname the “Forgotten Battalion.” Maybe they can be relocated to Somaliland. Notes [1] Part of the reason the situation is relatively calm in Somaliland might include the local government’s ruthlessness in cracking down on dissent. As Kit Klarenberg recalls: In late 2022, mass protests broke out in the contested Somalian city of Las Anod. Somaliland security forces crushed the upheaval using lethal force, leaving dozens dead. Unrest only intensified thereafter, leading to Somaliland’s military savagely shelling the city the next year. An April 2023Amnesty International report branded the assault “indiscriminate” in the extreme, with civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and mosques struck, hundreds killed and injured, and hundreds of thousands displaced. The Empire of Evil is an understatement. I am sad to say. Thank you, Conor. Blighty, even with 5m children living in poverty, has sent HMS Prince of Wales and its carrier group, mainly non-UK vessels, to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The group will sail via Suez, the second such deployment since the Queen Elizabeth deployed “east of Suez” in 2022, “a Brexit benefit” according to Johnson. Starmer spent the night before the fleet left aboard the Prince of Wales. One wonders if, en route to the South China Sea, the EU’s back yard according to von der Leyen, the carrier group will engage Ansarallah or what were called “fuzzy wuzzies” when Blighty was winning at Fashoda, Khartoum and Omdurman. Dad served with the RAF in Aden, so we are looking forward to the next iteration and how forces have recalibrated since the mid-1960s. Perhaps, a ship or two will make a detour for Crimea, like in 2022, and, again quoting Johnson, “poke the bear”. Are there any easy wars left to fight? BTW, I don’t think there’s any truth to the rumour that an Indian dock, or that beach where ships go to die, has been booked in case the Prince of Wales breaks down. Johnson, Starmer and Trump have some things in common, but I don’t know if Trump has children out of wedlock, the result of playing away from home. Thanks Colonel, In the meantime, Sweden is doing its best to become a third world nation by shovelling even more money to Ukraine https://thetransnational.substack.com/p/swedens-19th-aid-package-for-ukraine The CIA sure knew what they were doing when they organised the assassination of Palme with the connivance/looked the other way, of the Swedish security forces. Thank you, John. I don’t know about Sweden, but often see the benefits of the “aid” in the form of high end vehicles and fine dining in London, the south of England, Paris, Paris sur Mer / 21eme arrondissement and the Cote d’Azur. Private school fees are paid by local authorities, so a different pot to the above. Thank you, Colonel. If I remember correctly, when the British left Aden didn’t they have to virtually shoot their way out of that place instead of a quite hand-over ceremony like in most other places? Aden always was a tough place. Thank you, Rev. It was a bit. Think of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Good times, especially when people like my johnny foreigner dad fought for God, Queen and Country, as opposed to Zionist chicken hawks now. “Perhaps, a ship or two will make a detour for Crimea, like in 2022, and, again quoting Johnson, “poke the bear”.” They have to poke first the New Ottomans, to get permission to enter the Black Sea… Fortunately for the US before they head off into Somaliland, they will be able to draw from many experts that have knowledge of the culture and religion and the people in this region, know who the different factions are, know who the real players are behind the scenes, know the history of this area which particular emphasis on recent history, what cultural taboos they need to be careful of, which countries are supplying military expertise and equipment to the different factions, how the US can go in and have the locals see them as a reliable partner worth trusting, what the short and long term budgetary requirements will be needed to make full use of limited resources and so forth. Psych! Thank you, Rev. Why? A PPE from Oxford is more than enough and shouting at johnny foreigners in a plummy accent, perhaps wearing a pith helmet. And that is precisely what they won’t do. It is not the American way. I believe that what Trump’s referencing when he says the US ‘should be favored’ is that we have guaranteed unimpeded transit to a bunch of countries as per some previous accord, sometimes–the US military felt–to the neglect of US shipping, as our ability to spread the umbrella for all became more and more limited under Biden.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT Sees Second-Largest Bitcoin Inflow Since Launch, Nearing $1 Billion

The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin (BTC) Trust ETF (IBIT) saw $970.9 million in inflows, marking its second-largest net inflow since launching in January 2024, according to Farside data. Monday accounted for $591.2 million in new capital, which saw heavy outflows from competitors: Fidelity’s FBTC lost $86.9 million, Bitwise’s BITB dropped $21.1 million, and ARK’s ARKB saw $226.3 million in outflows. The rise comes alongside a 7.2% rise in BTC over the past seven days with it now trading at $94,900. Since April 22, IBIT has amassed over $4.5 billion in net inflows, bucking the market trend. Industry experts have taken note. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, remarked: Eric Balchunas, Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst, added: Meanwhile, in derivatives markets, open interest (OI) on CME Bitcoin Futures continues to fall, now sitting at 132,750 BTC after four consecutive days of decline, according to CME data. The recent decline in open interest could be coming to an end, as the annualized basis yield has climbed from around 5% to 9% in April, according to Velo data. This resurgence in basis trade profitability could prompt renewed activity and a short-term rebound in open interest. Why it matters: In a typical basis trade, investors buy spot bitcoin and short bitcoin futures to lock in the price gap. When the yield is high, demand for futures rises, boosting OI. As the yield shrinks, fewer traders engage in the strategy, leading to declining open interest and signaling reduced leverage in the market.

Wall Street analysts expect the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants—Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla—to deliver an average 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged despite rising trade tensions. Should the U.S. economy sidestep a recession, these seven companies are uniquely positioned to outperform. Meanwhile, volatility (VIX) readings can guide whether to lean on Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies or revert to simple buy-and-hold—and if the Mag 7 stumbles, you can hedge with inverse ETFs like QID. Why Apple Wins: Services division with >60% gross margins cushions hardware cyclicality. 1.8 billion active devices underpin a recurring upgrade cycle. $200 B+ net cash supports buybacks and dividends. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run the AAPL Double Agent—long AAPL vs. its inverse (e.g., SCC, ProShares UltraShort Consumer Discretionary). VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture steady services growth. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Apple Inc. (AAPL) The AI Trading Double Agent strategy is uniquely positioned to outperform traditional trading methods when applied to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID). By combining long positions in AAPL, a global leader in technology and innovation, with a hedge using QID, this approach capitalizes on bullish trends in individual equities and bearish swings within the broader tech sector. The dual-strategy framework allows traders to navigate volatile markets effectively, ensuring that profit opportunities are maximized regardless of market direction. This innovative system leverages advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis to identify optimal entry and exit points, making it particularly effective in responding to rapid shifts in sentiment or macroeconomic factors influencing technology stocks. The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the NASDAQ-100 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. AAPL and QID: Analyzing the Anticorrelation Dynamics The chart illustrates the performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF (QID) over a one-year period, highlighting an apparent anticorrelation between the two assets. AAPL's stock price shows a generally upward trend, with significant gains throughout the year, culminating in a 33.23% increase by March 2025. In contrast, QID, which is designed to provide double inverse exposure to the Nasdaq-100 index, exhibits a downward trajectory, reflecting losses that amount to -13.56% over the same period. This inverse relationship suggests that as AAPL's stock price rises, QID tends to decline, and vice versa. This anticorrelation can be attributed to several factors, including AAPL's significant weight in the Nasdaq-100 index, which QID seeks to short. As AAPL performs well, it positively impacts the Nasdaq-100, leading to losses for QID, which aims to profit from declines in the index. Investors often use such relationships to hedge risk or capitalize on market movements by taking opposing positions in correlated or anticorrelated assets. However, it is important to note that while the chart shows a strong historical pattern, future performance is not guaranteed, and other market dynamics could influence these trends. Why Microsoft Wins: Azure’s enterprise contracts deliver predictable, high-margin cloud revenue. AI integrations boost Office and Dynamics ARPU. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Deploy MSFT Double Agent, flipping into PSQ (ProShares Short QQQ) or SQQQ (UltraShort QQQ) when risk spikes. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride Azure’s secular growth. Why Alphabet Wins: YouTube/Search ads rebound with sticky ad spend. Google Cloud margin expansion. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use GOOGL Double Agent, hedging with QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ) to offset tech-heavy weakness. VIX < 20: Buy & hold on ad and cloud recovery. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the S&P 500 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. Why Amazon Wins: Prime ecosystem locks in fee income; AWS powers cash flow. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Activate AMZN Double Agent, shifting into SDS (UltraShort S&P 500) or SPXS (Daily S&P 500 Bear 3X) to hedge broad market dips. VIX < 20: Buy & hold for AWS and Prime tailwinds. Why Nvidia Wins: GPUs are the backbone of the AI boom; data-center margins >70%. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Engage NVDA/NVDS Double Agent, hedging with QID or SOXS (UltraShort Semiconductors) on semiconductor pullbacks. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride AI-hardware growth. AI‑Powered Hedging with Double Agent NVDA/NVDS To safeguard portfolios against the kind of abrupt sell‑off NVIDIA may face in China—whether from export‑control news or broader market shocks—Tickeron offers its AI Trading Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy. This dual‑agent framework runs two complementary AI modules in parallel: Bull Agent (NVDA): Continuously scans technical indicators, volume patterns, and NVIDIA‑specific news feeds to identify high‑probability long entry points. When the AI detects sustained bullish momentum—such as breakouts on accelerating volume or positive revisions to analyst forecasts—it allocates capital to NVDA, capturing upside efficiently. Bear Agent (NVDS): Simultaneously monitors risk signals—like widening bid‑ask spreads, sudden drops in open interest, or negative regulatory headlines—and automatically shifts exposure into NVDS, a bespoke inverse instrument designed to profit from NVIDIA’s declines. The Bear Agent employs tight stop‑loss logic and dynamically adjusts position size based on real‑time volatility, ensuring that losses are contained and hedges are scaled appropriately. By orchestrating these two agents under a unified risk‑management umbrella, the Double Agent system maintains a net market‑neutral stance when signals conflict, or a directional tilt when one view decisively outweighs the other. Backtests over the past two years show the Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy: Reduces Maximum Drawdowns by over 40% versus a simple buy‑and‑hold NVDA position during major sell‑offs. Improves Risk‑Adjusted Returns, with a Sharpe ratio nearly 2× that of NVDA alone. Executes Automatically in milliseconds, eliminating emotional delays and ensuring that hedges are in place the moment bearish conditions emerge. Why Meta Wins: AI-driven ad targeting and potential Reality Labs inflection. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run META Double Agent, flipping into PSQ or SQQQ when engagement metrics wobble. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture high-margin ad profits. Why Tesla Wins: EV market share gains and improving battery margins. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use TSLA/TSLQ Double Agent, hedging with TZA (Daily Small Cap Bear 3X) or SILJ (MicroSectors Silver 3X) if you need broader market or metal-linked protection. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to benefit from long-term EV adoption. Tesla, Inc. remains one of the most dynamic companies in the world, leading the charge in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, energy generation, and storage solutions. As the largest automaker by market capitalization, Tesla has demonstrated its ability to innovate and disrupt traditional industries. With electric vehicles growing in popularity and a global push towards sustainability, Tesla's stock has experienced remarkable growth over the past few years. AI Trading Bot recommends a BUY LONG position on TSLA, reflecting the ongoing optimism about Tesla’s long-term prospects. The company’s expanding product lineup, including electric trucks, energy storage solutions, and advancements in autonomous driving technology, continues to position it as a leader in the future of transportation and energy. In conjunction with the long position in TSLA, the AI Trading Bot also recommends buying TSDD, the GraniteShares 2x Short TSLA Daily ETF. This ETF is designed to provide investors with a leveraged inverse exposure to Tesla’s stock, allowing traders to hedge against the potential for downside movements in Tesla’s share price. Given Tesla’s volatile nature, the hedging strategy of holding TSDD alongside TSLA allows traders to balance their exposure. The ability to capitalize on both the upward and downward movements of Tesla's stock makes this pairing an effective trading strategy for advanced traders seeking dynamic risk management solutions. When the Mag 7 names collectively stumble or the Nasdaq-heavy indices roll over, consider these inverse ETFs as tactical hedges: QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ): A 2× inverse of the Nasdaq-100—ideal to hedge broad tech pullbacks. SDS (ProShares UltraShort S&P 500): A 2× inverse of the S&P 500—useful when broader indices slump alongside tech. SOXS (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the PHLX Semiconductor Index—targets semiconductor-specific declines. SPXS (Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the S&P 500—aggressive hedge in deep downturns. Tactical Example: If VIX spikes above 25 and you’re long NVDA, a quick long position in QID can offset 2× losses as GPUs underperform. When volatility subsides (VIX < 20), unwind QID and shift back to buy-and-hold your core Mag 7 positions. High Volatility (VIX > 25): Markets are prone to abrupt reversals. Tickeron’s AI Double Agents automate hedging across both single-name and broad inverse ETFs, limiting drawdowns. Low Volatility (VIX < 20): Trends become more reliable. A buy-and-hold approach on high-quality names captures secular growth with minimal friction. Earnings beats can reinforce the Mag 7’s leadership; misses may prompt tactical hedges. Date Company Release Time Consensus EPS Consensus Revenue Trading Note Tue, Apr 22 Tesla (TSLA) 4:07 PM ET; Call 5:30 $0.43 $21.8 B Beat? Unwind TSLA/TSLQ hedge; Miss? Add NVDS or QID positions.

Fri, Apr 26 Microsoft (MSF If the U.S. avoids a recession, the Magnificent Seven are poised for outsized profit growth in 2025. But even the strongest fundamentals can be shaken by market turbulence. By dynamically switching between Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies during VIX spikes and reverting to buy-and-hold when volatility subsides—and by tactically deploying inverse ETFs like QID to hedge downturns—you can both protect capital and ride the next leg of the Mag 7 rally.

The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. Why Amazon Wins: Prime ecosystem locks in fee income; AWS powers cash flow. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Activate AMZN Double Agent, shifting into SDS (UltraShort S&P 500) or SPXS (Daily S&P 500 Bear 3X) to hedge broad market dips. VIX < 20: Buy & hold for AWS and Prime tailwinds. Why Nvidia Wins: GPUs are the backbone of the AI boom; data-center margins >70%. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Engage NVDA/NVDS Double Agent, hedging with QID or SOXS (UltraShort Semiconductors) on semiconductor pullbacks. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride AI-hardware growth. AI‑Powered Hedging with Double Agent NVDA/NVDS To safeguard portfolios against the kind of abrupt sell‑off NVIDIA may face in China—whether from export‑control news or broader market shocks—Tickeron offers its AI Trading Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy. This dual‑agent framework runs two complementary AI modules in parallel: Bull Agent (NVDA): Continuously scans technical indicators, volume patterns, and NVIDIA‑specific news feeds to identify high‑probability long entry points. When the AI detects sustained bullish momentum—such as breakouts on accelerating volume or positive revisions to analyst forecasts—it allocates capital to NVDA, capturing upside efficiently. Bear Agent (NVDS): Simultaneously monitors risk signals—like widening bid‑ask spreads, sudden drops in open interest, or negative regulatory headlines—and automatically shifts exposure into NVDS, a bespoke inverse instrument designed to profit from NVIDIA’s declines. The Bear Agent employs tight stop‑loss logic and dynamically adjusts position size based on real‑time volatility, ensuring that losses are contained and hedges are scaled appropriately. By orchestrating these two agents under a unified risk‑management umbrella, the Double Agent system maintains a net market‑neutral stance when signals conflict, or a directional tilt when one view decisively outweighs the other. Backtests over the past two years show the Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy: Reduces Maximum Drawdowns by over 40% versus a simple buy‑and‑hold NVDA position during major sell‑offs. Improves Risk‑Adjusted Returns, with a Sharpe ratio nearly 2× that of NVDA alone. Executes Automatically in milliseconds, eliminating emotional delays and ensuring that hedges are in place the moment bearish conditions emerge. Why Meta Wins: AI-driven ad targeting and potential Reality Labs inflection. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run META Double Agent, flipping into PSQ or SQQQ when engagement metrics wobble. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture high-margin ad profits. Why Tesla Wins: EV market share gains and improving battery margins. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use TSLA/TSLQ Double Agent, hedging with TZA (Daily Small Cap Bear 3X) or SILJ (MicroSectors Silver 3X) if you need broader market or metal-linked protection. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to benefit from long-term EV adoption. Tesla, Inc. remains one of the most dynamic companies in the world, leading the charge in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, energy generation, and storage solutions. As the largest automaker by market capitalization, Tesla has demonstrated its ability to innovate and disrupt traditional industries. With electric vehicles growing in popularity and a global push towards sustainability, Tesla's stock has experienced remarkable growth over the past few years. AI Trading Bot recommends a BUY LONG position on TSLA, reflecting the ongoing optimism about Tesla’s long-term prospects. The company’s expanding product lineup, including electric trucks, energy storage solutions, and advancements in autonomous driving technology, continues to position it as a leader in the future of transportation and energy. In conjunction with the long position in TSLA, the AI Trading Bot also recommends buying TSDD, the GraniteShares 2x Short TSLA Daily ETF. This ETF is designed to provide investors with a leveraged inverse exposure to Tesla’s stock, allowing traders to hedge against the potential for downside movements in Tesla’s share price. Given Tesla’s volatile nature, the hedging strategy of holding TSDD alongside TSLA allows traders to balance their exposure. The ability to capitalize on both the upward and downward movements of Tesla's stock makes this pairing an effective trading strategy for advanced traders seeking dynamic risk management solutions. When the Mag 7 names collectively stumble or the Nasdaq-heavy indices roll over, consider these inverse ETFs as tactical hedges: QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ): A 2× inverse of the Nasdaq-100—ideal to hedge broad tech pullbacks. SDS (ProShares UltraShort S&P 500): A 2× inverse of the S&P 500—useful when broader indices slump alongside tech. SOXS (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the PHLX Semiconductor Index—targets semiconductor-specific declines. SPXS (Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the S&P 500—aggressive hedge in deep downturns. Tactical Example: If VIX spikes above 25 and you’re long NVDA, a quick long position in QID can offset 2× losses as GPUs underperform. When volatility subsides (VIX < 20), unwind QID and shift back to buy-and-hold your core Mag 7 positions. High Volatility (VIX > 25): Markets are prone to abrupt reversals. Tickeron’s AI Double Agents automate hedging across both single-name and broad inverse ETFs, limiting drawdowns. Low Volatility (VIX < 20): Trends become more reliable. A buy-and-hold approach on high-quality names captures secular growth with minimal friction. Earnings beats can reinforce the Mag 7’s leadership; misses may prompt tactical hedges. Date Company Release Time Consensus EPS Consensus Revenue Trading Note Tue, Apr 22 Tesla (TSLA) 4:07 PM ET; Call 5:30 $0.43 $21.8 B Beat? Unwind TSLA/TSLQ hedge; Miss? Add NVDS or QID positions.

Wall Street analysts expect the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants—Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla—to deliver an average 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged despite rising trade tensions. Should the U.S. economy sidestep a recession, these seven companies are uniquely positioned to outperform. Meanwhile, volatility (VIX) readings can guide whether to lean on Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies or revert to simple buy-and-hold—and if the Mag 7 stumbles, you can hedge with inverse ETFs like QID. Why Apple Wins: Services division with >60% gross margins cushions hardware cyclicality. 1.8 billion active devices underpin a recurring upgrade cycle. $200 B+ net cash supports buybacks and dividends. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run the AAPL Double Agent—long AAPL vs. its inverse (e.g., SCC, ProShares UltraShort Consumer Discretionary). VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture steady services growth. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Apple Inc. (AAPL) The AI Trading Double Agent strategy is uniquely positioned to outperform traditional trading methods when applied to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID). By combining long positions in AAPL, a global leader in technology and innovation, with a hedge using QID, this approach capitalizes on bullish trends in individual equities and bearish swings within the broader tech sector. The dual-strategy framework allows traders to navigate volatile markets effectively, ensuring that profit opportunities are maximized regardless of market direction. This innovative system leverages advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis to identify optimal entry and exit points, making it particularly effective in responding to rapid shifts in sentiment or macroeconomic factors influencing technology stocks. The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the NASDAQ-100 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. AAPL and QID: Analyzing the Anticorrelation Dynamics The chart illustrates the performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF (QID) over a one-year period, highlighting an apparent anticorrelation between the two assets. AAPL's stock price shows a generally upward trend, with significant gains throughout the year, culminating in a 33.23% increase by March 2025. In contrast, QID, which is designed to provide double inverse exposure to the Nasdaq-100 index, exhibits a downward trajectory, reflecting losses that amount to -13.56% over the same period. This inverse relationship suggests that as AAPL's stock price rises, QID tends to decline, and vice versa. This anticorrelation can be attributed to several factors, including AAPL's significant weight in the Nasdaq-100 index, which QID seeks to short. As AAPL performs well, it positively impacts the Nasdaq-100, leading to losses for QID, which aims to profit from declines in the index. Investors often use such relationships to hedge risk or capitalize on market movements by taking opposing positions in correlated or anticorrelated assets. However, it is important to note that while the chart shows a strong historical pattern, future performance is not guaranteed, and other market dynamics could influence these trends. Why Microsoft Wins: Azure’s enterprise contracts deliver predictable, high-margin cloud revenue. AI integrations boost Office and Dynamics ARPU. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Deploy MSFT Double Agent, flipping into PSQ (ProShares Short QQQ) or SQQQ (UltraShort QQQ) when risk spikes. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride Azure’s secular growth. Why Alphabet Wins: YouTube/Search ads rebound with sticky ad spend. Google Cloud margin expansion. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use GOOGL Double Agent, hedging with QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ) to offset tech-heavy weakness. VIX < 20: Buy & hold on ad and cloud recovery. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures.

Title: These 4 tech billionaires who attended or donated to Trump's inauguration lost $194 billion in his first 100 days

Full Content:
It's been almost 100 days since President Donald Trump was sworn into office with some of the biggest names in tech near his side. Several tech billionaires cozied up to Trump ahead of his second term in part by attending the inauguration and donating to the inaugural fund. The appearance of a joint front stood in contrast to years of Trump criticizing Big Tech and calling out some tech leaders directly. A lot has changed since Inauguration Day. Tech leaders who supported Trump have seen both their net worths and the stock value of the companies they lead decline, as the administration's tariff-fueled trade war has coincided with a disruption in financial markets worldwide. Four of the richest tech billionaires who attended the inauguration or donated to it — Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang — have lost a collective $193.6 billion since January 20, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Here's how much each tech billionaire has lost, according to Bloomberg's net worth estimates as of market close on Monday. Net worth on January 20: $449 billion Net worth on April 28: $335 billion Loss: $114 billion Musk, the tech billionaire who's gotten closer to Trump more than any other as an advisor, has seen the greatest decline in wealth, though he remains the world's richest person. Musk's work with the White House DOGE office led to swift backlash and a wave of protests against Tesla. The electric-vehicle maker has been struggling, with its stock price down nearly 25% this year. After Tesla reported lackluster quarterly earnings last week, Musk announced he would be stepping back from DOGE in May, spending just one or two days a week on government matters. He has consistently defended his work with the White House to eliminate waste and fraud in government. Net worth on January 20: $245 billion Net worth on April 28: $209 billion Loss: $36 billion Bezos's wealth, most of which is tied to stock in Amazon, the company he founded, has declined sharply since February. Analysts have said Amazon is especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, including the 145% tariff on China, due to the number of products sold on the site, either directly or through third-parties, that come from the country. Some Amazon sellers have been raising prices on goods like appliances, snacks, and electronics, though the company has said it represents a small fraction of the total amount of goods sold on the site. Net worth on January 20: $217 billion Net worth on April 28: $195 billion Loss: $22 billion Zuckerberg may have had the worst relationship with Trump compared to any other tech billionaire prior to the election. Trump had repeatedly lashed out against the Meta CEO on Truth Social and suggested he should be investigated or jailed after Facebook temporarily banned Trump's account following the January 6 Capitol riot. Meta, the primary source of Zuckerberg's wealth, has been fighting an anti-trust lawsuit brought by the government that has not gone away under Trump. Zuckerberg earlier this month sat for three days of testimony after the antitrust trial opened. The Meta CEO testified for more than 10 hours and was grilled by the FTC's lead attorney. Net worth on January 20: $117 billion Net worth on April 28: $95.4 billion Loss: $21.6 billion While Huang did not attend the inauguration, Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural fund. Huang's wealth, a majority of which is tied to Nvidia stock, has also dropped since January, when he attended the inauguration. Nvidia stock has fallen over 21% year to date, with the company facing several setbacks that include Trump's tariffs, as the company sources a majority of its chips from overseas, primarily Taiwan. The company also said earlier this month it expected to take a $5.5 billion hit on its first-quarter earnings as a result of the Trump administration's restrictions on its chip exports to China. Other tech leaders who attended the inauguration saw declines in the stock prices of the companies they lead, including Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google. Though some estimates suggest the CEOs are billionaires, they are not on Bloomberg's list of the top 500 richest people, so the change in their estimated net worth since the inauguration was not publicly available. But Apple's share price has fallen nearly 14% this year, while the share price of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has fallen nearly 15% this year. Jump to

Title: 'Steadiest ship in a brewing macro storm': Why Wall Street is bullish on Meta ahead of first-quarter earnings
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-platforms-q1-earnings-preview-wall-street-analyst-expectations-ai-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-29T08:00:02Z

It was another good quarter for Meta, which reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, beating sales and earnings-per-share estimates. Investors had been looking out for updates on its AI spending and plans, whether it's seeing any blowback from advertisers after Meta's controversial announcement that it's cutting back on content moderation, and any comments about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans and praised its Reality Labs division, which has routinely lost around $4 billion in each of the past several quarters. Meta is also raising its spending estimates for the year to invest further in AI data centers and infrastructure. Meanwhile, strong ad revenue showed advertisers weren't put off by the company's content moderation pullback which has recently begun taking effect and which includes replacing third-party fact-checking with community notes. The conversation was more muted, though, on tariffs. Zuckerberg kicked off the investor call by saying Meta is "well-positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty," though he didn't mention Trump or his tariffs by name. CFO Susan Li similarly referenced the "dynamic micro environment." The company did speak out about the European Commission's recent decision that the company violated the Digital Markets Act. Meta plans to appeal the decision, which came with a €200 million fine, but said it expects it'll need to make modifications that "could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue" as early as Q3. The company reported revenue for the period of $42.31 billion, beating Bloomberg's consensus analyst estimate of $41.38 billion. It also issued a second-quarter sales forecast in line with expectations. Meta's stock rose more than 5% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. Shares had fallen 1% on Wednesday, putting the stock down 7% so far in 2025 at the close. Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney asked whether Meta's consistent $4 billion-per-quarter Reality Labs losses would ever come down, and if so, why and when. Zuckerberg pointed to the rising momentum behind Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, saying they've "really taken off" and just "tripled in sales" in the last year. "There are more investments that I think make sense to make around making sure that we can distribute this and grow it very quickly," he added. "If you look at some of the leading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they get to their third generation, they're often selling 10 million units and scaling from there," Zuckerberg said. "I'm not sure if we're going to do exactly that," he said, "but I think that's like the ballpark of the opportunity." Zuckerberg briefly talked about how AI is going to change how people consume and create content online. While social media platforms mostly started off as text-based feeds, then photo, and are now in the "video era," Zuckerberg said that the next big thing could be interactive content. "In the near future, I think that we're going to have content in our feeds that you can interact with and that it'll interact back with you rather than you just watching it," Zuckerberg said on the call. He recently said on Theo Von's "This Past Weekend" podcast that tech will move away from mobile phone screens and to holograms. Threads, which Meta launched in 2023 to compete with X (formerly Twitter), has surpassed 350 million monthly active users, Zuckerberg said on the call. It "continues to be on track to become our next major social app," he added. AI's improvements to Meta's content recommendation systems also contributed to a 35% increase in time spent on Threads, Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg also kicked off the call talking about the company's AI work, calling this "the major theme" at Meta right now. He listed 5 ways AI usage is playing out at Meta: "Improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, meta AI, and AI devices." While he noted these are "long-term investments that are downstream from us," he added that he thinks further down the road the company "will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making." Both of these sentiments should sound familiar, as he's given similar remarks when pressed on the company's AI initiatives and spending in previous earnings calls. In his opening remarks, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is "well-positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty" — but didn't explicitly name President Trump or cite his tariffs. CFO Susan Li prefaced the company's guidance estimates by acknowledging the "dynamic macro environment" and noting the range "reflects the potential for a wider set of outcomes." "We continue to feel good about the fundamental drivers of revenue growth, and believe the past work we've done to streamline our operations and cost profile puts us in a strong position to navigate a variety of outcomes," she said. However, some listeners (including at BI!) noted glitches as Zuckerberg started to speak. Who the hell is running $META conference call! Keeps glitching Investing.com senior analyst Thomas Monteiro says the company's AI integration plan "not only keeps growing at an impressive rate but also does so without burning through piles of cash, unlike most of the competition." "Meta is quietly gaining ground as one of the greatest winners of the AI revolution — with still lots of tailwinds and room for expansion," he said. While tariff uncertainty means eyes are on Meta's APAC ad revenue from retailers like Temu and Shein advertising to US consumers, the company is well-positioned to "free up margins from other parts of the operation without damaging its longer-term growth plans" if those figures skew lower, Monteiro adds. As EMARKETER senior analyst Minda Smiley points out, Meta's strong earnings and healthy ad business show its massive content moderation overhaul in January, which included ending its fact-checking program and switching to a community notes-based model, didn't scare off advertisers. The next test will be staying strong in the uncertain macroeconomic environment stemming from tariffs, though Meta's sheer size and reach should help safeguard them. "Advertisers will allocate more ad dollars to proven, sophisticated networks like Facebook and Instagram — all while pulling back spend on smaller social platforms — while they navigate uncertainty," Smiley notes. When big tech companies like Meta do mass layoffs — as the company has done over the last couple of years — it gets plenty of attention. So you might be surprised to learn that in addition to firing thousands of people, Meta has also been hiring. You can see that story buried in the company's earnings reports. After the first quarter of 2023, Meta had 77,114 fulltime employees. Then the company pushed out huge swaths of its employees, and by the end of that year it was down to 67,317. Meta continues to cut and trim throughout the company — it just rolled out cuts to its Reality Labs division, as we note below. But at the same time, it has also been hiring! Meta now says it has 76,834 employees. That's an 11% increase over the previous year, and it means Mark Zuckerberg's workforce has almost exactly as many people as it did two years ago. Meta's Reality Labs division, which builds the Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the Horizon Worlds platform, posted a $4.2 billion loss. That's wider than the $3.85 billion loss a year ago, but narrowed from $4.65 billion last quarter. The unit remains a massive money sink, with over $50 billion in cumulative losses since 2020. Just last week, Meta laid off staff from its VR gaming teams and the Supernatural VR fitness app as part of a broader shakeup. Still, the company is keeping its foot on the gas — nearly 500 Reality Labs jobs remain open. One bright spot? Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which Zuckerberg sported at LlamaCon, the company's first event for AI developers yesterday, have become a surprise hit. Meta is reportedly expected to launch a new version with a built-in display later this year. The European Commission, the main executive body of the European Union, recently published a decision finding that Meta breached the Digital Markets Act, a set of regulations in the bloc meant to regulate the power of six digital "gatekeepers," aka Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft. The Commission consequently fined Meta €200 million. Meta weighed in on the decision in its earnings report. "We expect we will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter of 2025," the company said. Meta will appeal the decision but said that changes to its model may be made before or during the appeal process. The company is being closely watched this earnings season, along with its Big Tech peers, for comments about its AI spending. It raised its estimate for full-year capital expenditures from a prior range of $60-$65 billion to $64-$72 billion now. That's up significantly from its full-year 2024 capex of $39.23 billion. The increase "reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware." Meta said in its earnings report, however, that the majority of its capex this year will go toward its "core business." First quarter Revenue: $42.31 billion, +16% y/y, estimate $41.38 billion Operating income: $17.56 billion, +27% y/y, estimate $15.52 billion Ad impressions: +5% vs. +20% y/y, estimate +6.87% Second quarter forecast Full-year 2025 Capital expenditure: $64 billion to $72 billion, saw $60 billion to $65 billion, estimate $59.27 billion Source: Bloomberg data Meta stock dipped 1% ahead of its earnings release on Wednesday after the closing bell. The S&P 500 closed 0.2% higher, while the Dow rose 0.4%. Stocks were broadly lower on Wednesday after the release of first-quarter GDP, which dropped at an annualized rate of 0.3%, but reversed the losses into the close. It seems like the Meta CEO has been everywhere ahead of his company's earnings report. From his marriage to AI trends, Zuck is getting deep this week during livestreams and podcast appearances. He opened up about the 7-foot statue he dedicated to his wife and got real about higher education. The question on everyone's lips this earnings season is how companies plan to tackle tariffs. Zuckerberg seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach when asked about it, but investors will want some answers. A day before its earnings, Meta held its first-ever AI developer event, LlamaCon, unveiling a new Llama API. The company also announced a standalone Meta AI app, its most direct challenge yet to OpenAI's ChatGPT. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was joined onstage by Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Databricks' Ali Ghodsi, underscoring Meta's push to become central to the AI developer ecosystem. The event wasn't just about product announcements — it was a calculated play to reassure investors. "I expect Meta's earnings release and subsequent call to be packed with AI news," Forrester VP Mike Proulx told Business Insider, "not only because the company is making real and tangible progress, but also to counterbalance the intense pressure Meta is facing on multiple fronts," he said, pointing to the ongoing FTC antitrust trial against the company. Expect Wall Street to listen closely during today's earnings call for signs that Meta's massive AI investments — including up to $65 billion in 2025 capex — are starting to deliver returns. Meta's X competitor, Threads, had 320 million monthly active users at the time of the company's last earnings call, adding a million new people daily. It's one of the few recent social apps to scale this quickly, and Meta is finally starting to test monetization. Last week, the company began rolling out ads on Threads globally. Still, Meta executives have said they don't expect the app to contribute meaningful revenue in 2025. For now, it's about playing the long game. Zuckerberg has said Threads could one day reach a billion users and become "the leading discussion platform." The question for Wall Street is whether Meta can sustain the momentum. Meta hasn't commented on whether the US-China trade war will hurt its bottom line, but it's another thing investors will be watching closely over the next few earnings cycles. Meta has said that 11% of its total ad sales last year came from Chinese advertisers, which could dial back their spending as the trade war looms. With tariffs on Chinese imports now as high as 145%, many companies can't afford to sell into the US market, which means there's less incentive to advertise to American shoppers. If that trend accelerates, it could negatively impact Meta's ad business. Analysts will be closely watching Meta's investments in generative AI and its Reality Labs division, which has hemorrhaged money in recent quarters. Zuckerberg has said he's happy to keep funneling tens of billions in additional capex on generative AI even as analysts and investors press Big Tech for answers on when they'll see the massive spending pay off. Meta recently held its inaugural LlamaCon, an AI developer conference. The conference featured remarks from Meta executives, including Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi. On Tuesday, the company also announced a standalone Meta AI app to compete with ChatGPT. Wells Fargo said it expects Meta to be the "steadiest ship in a brewing macro storm," arguing that its dominance relative to other advertising platforms should shield it from some of the macroeconomic pain. "Checks indicate ad spend growth on Meta moderated throughout the qtr, but likely more resilient vs. other ad platforms against softer macro backdrop given minimal brand exposure," Wells Fargo said. The bank said Meta's Reels platform, which directly competes against TikTok, should have benefited from the uncertainty surrounding a potential TikTok ban earlier this year. "Checks suggest ad spend on TikTok shifted to Meta during the heightened uncertainty in Jan, with some budgets permanently moving to Reels," the bank said. Wells Fargo rates Meta Platforms at "Overweight" with a $752 price target. A major topic during Tesla's earnings call last week was blowback over Elon Musk's political involvement with the Trump administration. While Zuckerberg's ties to the White House aren't as deep as Musk's, he has been increasingly involved with Trump 2.0 — and investors could make it known whether they approve. Zuckerberg has had a contentious relationship with the president over the years; Trump once threatened the Meta CEO with life in prison. However, since the election, Zuck has seemed to try to smooth things over. Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and Zuckerberg was among the tech billionaires who got a front row seat to the swearing in This year, Meta partnered with the White House to bring the Easter Egg Roll. Despite macroeconomic concerns, JPMorgan said that Meta's strong execution and AI opportunities should help the company's results. "We believe META remains well-owned driven by strong execution & growing AI monetization," JPMorgan analysts wrote. "We're bullish on AI-driven Ad improvements, video unification, WhatsApp Ads, Llama, & Meta AI." The bank said it believes investors expect Meta Platforms' revenue to grow by about 13% year over year. Meeting or beating those expectations would likely boost the stock. It said that while macro factors are a concern, "tens of millions of advertisers should prove relative insulation." With regards to capex, JPMorgan expects the company to maintain its aggressive investment philosophy to capture the AI opportunity. "Our $108B 2025 GAAP expenses is below Meta's $114B-$119B guide as we expect META to rationalize expenses against lower growth," JPMorgan said. JPMorgan rates Meta Platforms at "Overweight" with a $610 price target. Investors will be watching closely to see if Meta's Reality Labs — its hardware and virtual reality division — is cutting back on its burn rate after racking up more than $50 billion in losses since 2020. The division, responsible for products like Quest headsets and smart glasses, was reorganized in January with key leaders now reporting directly to Meta's top brass. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has called 2025 "the most critical" year for Reality Labs, writing in an internal memo obtained by BI earlier this year that it could determine whether the effort is remembered as a visionary feat or a "legendary misadventure." He also stressed that Horizon Worlds on mobile must succeed for Meta's metaverse ambitions to stay afloat. Bosworth said Reality Labs grew sales 40% in 2024 and cited "massive" growth in wearables. But investors will want to see if those revenue gains are enough to begin narrowing the division's steep losses, which totaled $4.4 billion in Q3 of 2024 alone. Bank of America is leaning bullish on Meta heading into its coming earnings release. The bank said takeaways from Alphabet's comments on YouTube and its advertising checks should fuel a "modest beat" for Meta. Meta's workforce reductions in February and recent layoff announcements related to its Reality Labs division suggest that management is laser-focused on controlling operating expenses. "For expense guide, we would expect a trajectory toward the low end of the current $114-$119bn 2025 range," Bank of America said. The bank is also bullish on Meta's growing AI capabilities and its potential to unlock more advertising spending. "We think Meta's Al driven ad improvements still have several quarters to play out and for 2025 we see strong drivers of growth, including: 1) Expanding AI/ML ad capabilities, 2) Growing SFV usage aided by AI suggestions, 3) Growing messaging revenues, & 4) Monetization of untapped surfaces (Threads, Meta Al, Marketplace)," the bank said. SFV refers to "short form video." Bank of America rates Meta Platforms at "Buy" with a $640 price target. An elephant in the room is the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust trial against Meta. The company isn't expected to discuss the ongoing case during its earnings call, and the litigation isn't expected to have a significant impact on the results. The trial kicked off earlier this month, and Zuckerberg testified over three days. The FTC alleges that Meta, then Facebook, violated US antitrust laws when it bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014. Asked about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, Zuckerberg testified that he considered having Facebook build its own photo-sharing service, but ultimately, "I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them." Meta's attorneys have argued that the company still faces competition from social media platforms including TikTok, YouTube, and X. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said Meta's Reels platform has the potential to drive significant growth for the company. "We still see a sizable opportunity for Reels to remain a key revenue growth tailwind for META in the coming years as the CPM gap closes further and as Reels continues to increase as a % of total ad impressions," Goldman Sachs said. On the spending front, the bank expects Meta to "somewhat pull back" on its planned investments due to macroeconomic headwinds. Goldman expects 2025 total GAAP expenses of about $110.5 billion, slightly below the company's guidance range of $114 billion to $119 billion. "For META, we see the key debates being how the company indicates a framework of balance between long-term investments and annualized operating costs if the macroeconomic environment impacts the business in the coming quarters," Goldman Sachs said. Goldman Sachs rates Meta Platforms at "Buy" with a $685 price target.

Title: UPS slashes 20,000 jobs, shuts facilities in $3.5B cost-cutting move after Amazon split

UPS plans to cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by mid-2025 as part of a cost-saving strategy amid economic uncertainty and reduced Amazon deliveries. The company is shifting away from lower-margin Amazon shipments (12% of revenue) to focus on more profitable sectors like healthcare and international deliveries. UPS expects $3.5 billion in savings by 2025, aiming to boost operating margins despite economic pressures from tariffs and slowing trade demand. First-quarter revenue ($21.5B) beat expectations, but UPS declined to update its full-year outlook due to unpredictable market conditions. Most layoffs will impact non-union management as UPS restructures its workforce and network, attempting to emerge "stronger and more nimble."

Most layoffs will impact non-union management as UPS restructures its workforce and network, attempting to emerge "stronger and more nimble." In a significant restructuring move, UPS announced plans on Tuesday to eliminate 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by June 2025. This aggressive cost-cutting strategy is being driven by its decision to reduce deliveries for Amazon and navigate an uncertain economic landscape. The layoffs will impact just over 4% of UPS's 490,000-strong workforce and follow last year's cut of 12,000 positions. Strategic pivot from Amazon The job cuts come after UPS's January decision to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it handles. While Amazon deliveries constitute approximately 12% of UPS's revenue, the company determined that profit margins from these shipments were too small and is now refocusing on more lucrative markets such as healthcare and international deliveries. During UPS's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, CEO Carol TomÃ© explained the rationale: "Amazon is our largest customer but it's not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business." Amazon maintains that it has a "strong working relationship" with UPS. Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, noted that Amazon had actually "offered to increase UPS' volumes before the delivery company made the decision to reduce its Amazon shipments." Nantel added, "Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision. We'll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers." Economic uncertainty and cost savings TomÃ© cited the uncertain economic environment as another factor in the company's restructuring: "The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years," she stated during Tuesday's earnings call. The company expects to save $3.5 billion in 2025 through these cost-cutting measures. "These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability," CFO Brian Dykes explained during the earnings call. Economic headwinds include extensive tariffs imposed by the Trump administration that have slowed trade and led companies to reduce costs in anticipation of reduced demand. For delivery companies like UPS, this slowdown likely means decreased demand for shipping services between businesses. UPS is keeping customers informed about tariff developments on its website and has introduced a tool called UPS Global Checkout that shows online shoppers the upfront costs for duties, fees and taxes. Financial performance and outlook Despite these challenges, UPS reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Tuesday, with revenue of $21.5 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $21.05 billion. The company posted an adjusted profit per share of $1.49, ahead of analysts' expectations of $1.38. "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," said CEO TomÃ©. However, UPS declined to provide any updates to its full-year outlook due to economic uncertainty. UPS had previously announced its expectation for 2025 revenue of approximately $89 billion. Of UPS's 490,000 employees, around 330,000 are represented by the Teamsters union. The company is consolidating its facilities and workforce as it prepares for reduced Amazon shipments. UPS may identify additional buildings for closure as it continues to review its network. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS," TomÃ© stated. Last year, UPS delivered an average of 22.4 million parcels per day, or 5.7 billion for the entire year. Whether the company can maintain its dominance while shedding jobs and facilities remains to be seen.

While Amazon deliveries constitute approximately 12% of UPS's revenue, the company determined that profit margins from these shipments were too small and is now refocusing on more lucrative markets such as healthcare and international deliveries. During UPS's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, CEO Carol TomÃ© explained the rationale: "Amazon is our largest customer but it's not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business." Amazon maintains that it has a "strong working relationship" with UPS. Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, noted that Amazon had actually "offered to increase UPS' volumes before the delivery company made the decision to reduce its Amazon shipments." Nantel added, "Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision. We'll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers." Economic uncertainty and cost savings TomÃ© cited the uncertain economic environment as another factor in the company's restructuring: "The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years," she stated during Tuesday's earnings call. The company expects to save $3.5 billion in 2025 through these cost-cutting measures. "These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability," CFO Brian Dykes explained during the earnings call. Economic headwinds include extensive tariffs imposed by the Trump administration that have slowed trade and led companies to reduce costs in anticipation of reduced demand. For delivery companies like UPS, this slowdown likely means decreased demand for shipping services between businesses. UPS is keeping customers informed about tariff developments on its website and has introduced a tool called UPS Global Checkout that shows online shoppers the upfront costs for duties, fees and taxes. Financial performance and outlook Despite these challenges, UPS reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Tuesday, with revenue of $21.5 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $21.05 billion.

Title: Gerry Thornley: all four Irish provinces beaten on same weekend for first time since March 2015

Time Published: 2025-04-29T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
All seems even less hunky dory underneath the surface after that weekend. For the first time since March 2015 all four Irish sides lost on the same weekend, on top of which the Ireland women’s team suffered their most sobering reality check of the campaign. That said, for those in Clontarf, Nenagh, Trinity, Dungannon, Skerries and Thomond it was the best weekend of the season. The last time all four Irish provinces lost on the same weekend was in the old Pro 12, when the quartet each suffered defeats to Welsh opposition. As then Leinster lost away to the Scarlets, while Munster, beaten in Cardiff on Friday night, lost to the Ospreys a decade ago. Connacht had a fall off in performance after their brave effort in defeat to the Stormers when losing to the Lions last Saturday, while Ulster were worn down by the Sharks’ superior physicality and depth on Saturday night. Leinster, of course, could afford just a second defeat of the season, especially as Glasgow were outmuscled at home by the Stormers on Friday night, so maintaining the eight-point gap at the top the table ahead of next Saturday’s Champions Cup showdown against a dangerous Northampton. Victory at home to Zebre a week later would ensure top seeding in the BKT URC playoffs ahead of their final game at home to Glasgow; additionally helpful if they have reached a fourth successive Champions Cup final a week later. By contrast Munster, Ulster and Connacht have all fallen outside the top eight, and there is a distinct likelihood that Ireland will only have two sides in next season’s Champions Cup for the first time ever, with the possibility that this may even be one side. That would be quite a fall. Munster and Ulster meet at Thomond Park next Friday week in what is now a dog-eat-dog scrap for playoff and Champions Cup qualification between two provinces who have been ever-presents in the 30 years of the latter competition. While Munster now sit ninth behind Benetton, with both on 41 points, by dint of winning less matches they have their destiny in their own hands as they also host the Italian outfit at Musgrave Park in the final round six nights later. By contrast an Ulster squad even more lacking in depth sit in 12th on 38 points, and so their need is the more acute in Thomond Park ahead of a trek to Edinburgh, who are 10th, on the ensuing Friday. Connacht’s chances of the top eight are more remote as they sit 14th on 35 points and must finish with wins at home to Edinburgh and away to Zebre if they are to have any chance of a top-eight place. Significantly, the Welsh quartet finish their campaigns with two games in South Africa. The fear always lurked that for all the huge improvement in the Ireland women’s team in the last 12 months some of it had to be attributed to the return of Olympian Sevens players who were unavailable in last season’s Six Nations, and that while they have become a good team they are not yet a good squad. In the absence of the hugely influential Sam Monaghan, Erin King and Aoife Wafer, that lack of depth was further exposed when losing Edel McMahon and Dorothy Wall in the first half of last Saturday’s loss to Scotland in Edinburgh. It’s still been a campaign of progress, with more competitive displays at home to England and France, as well as the high point of the win in Parma. But Saturday’s defeat is a setback psychologically, and certainly gives the first World Cup warm-up match against Scotland in Cork on August 2nd more significance. Either way while a World Cup semi-final is still a viable target, beating New Zealand again in the pool stages or overcoming France in the quarter-final looks a tall order, particularly after the stirring late comeback by Les Bleus in losing 43-42 in Saturday’s Grand Slam decider against England. Amid all this club rugby was seen at its best on the final weekend of the AIL as UL Bohs and Clontarf secured All-Ireland titles again at the Aviva Stadium. À la the Joey Carbery final when Clontarf beat Cork Constitution in 2016, last Sunday wasn’t quite the Hugh Cooney final, but it wasn’t far off it either. As a Clontarf centre who came through Blackrock, Cooney is not the first to plot such a journey, and while not wanting to saddle him unduly with comparisons to The Great One, with his leg power, explosiveness, pace and low centre of gravity the 21-year-old has similar attributes. Cooney and Hugh Gavin look like being the first of the new crop of young centres coming through to be capped this summer in Tbilisi or Georgia. Meanwhile Nenagh Ormond became the first Tipperary club to be promoted to Division 1A and Trinity preserved their 1B status with dramatic two-score comebacks at home to wilting UCC and Cashel sides. Dungannon won promotion to 1B by winning in Navan, Skerries stayed in 2B by beating Midleton at home, and Thomond reclaimed their AIL status by winning in Omagh in the only game that wasn’t a one-score affair. The league has found a niche. Ten-team divisions and playoffs ensure jeopardy and a dearth of dead rubbers until the very end. But having the finals a week after the semi-finals, which are just a fortnight after the three-game rush to the season’s final standings, is just too demanding a load for the mostly amateur and semi-pro players. The best final of recent times was two years ago, when Terenure beat Clontarf 50-24, which was a fortnight after the semi-finals. That’s the way it should be. The AIL finals could have been held next Sunday, on the May bank holiday weekend, which would also help rather than hinder clubs outside Dublin such as Cork Constitution in bringing members and fans to Dublin. It would also afford the IRFU, sponsors and finalists two weeks to promote the finals. The May bank holiday weekend should be enshrined in the club calendar as All-Ireland club rugby weekend. If occasionally this clashed with Leinster matches or the finals were lost to either TG4 or from the Aviva to somewhere else nor would that be the end of the world. gerry.thornley@irishtimes.com Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Irish drummer Kevin Brady: ‘Most nights you’re able to hear great live jazz. But we need something like classical has in the NCH’

There is a photograph of the quartet led by the Irish jazz drummer Kevin Brady that makes it look a little like a Scandi death-metal band. The American keyboardist Bill Carrothers – buzz-cut, beard and steely eye – is decked out in camouflaged military-style hunting jacket. The London-born, Vancouver-raised and Cologne-based saxophonist Seamus Blake, whose father was from Dublin, is peering out over lowered eyebrows with what comes across as a combination of scepticism and menace. Brady, who is dressed, like Blake, all in black, is solemn, glassy-eyed and half in deep shadow. The Irish bassist Dave Redmond, to the rear, looks, as Brady jokes to me, “like he urgently needs to be somewhere else”. In reality, the group, which works under the banner of the Kevin Brady Electric Quartet – in which Carrothers plays Fender Rhodes electric piano, Redmond switches to electric bass and Brady is increasingly integrating electronic drum percussion – is one of the most acclaimed and ambitious international jazz ensembles working in Ireland. Formed in 2019, the band combines a highly intuitive and interactive Irish rhythm section that has played together for 20 years or more with two of the most gifted and admired, if sometimes criminally undervalued, musicians in modern jazz. Carrothers, who is based in Michigan, has a long association with Redmond and Brady – as a piano trio they have released three highly rated studio albums, many featuring Carrothers’s winningly eclectic compositions – and he is renowned for his harmonic elegance, broad musical knowledge and many-sided virtuosity. Blake, a master tenor saxophonist, is a muscular and commanding soloist somewhat in the Michael Brecker and Chris Potter mode, yet with his own elastic sound, advanced sense of lyricism and endlessly inventive style. The overall result lands in several sweet spots between late-1960s Miles Davis and early-1970s Herbie Hancock: liquid electric postbop with catchy melodies, deep grooves, rhythmic ingenuity, consummate improvisation and a strikingly contemporary edge. While the group’s multinational nature and heavily in-demand members may make regular creative get-togethers something of a challenge, the Electric Quartet has released one celebrated album, Plan B – “timeless, joyous music that will further burnish the reputations of all concerned”, according to the Irish Times review. Next month the band embarks on one of its rare tours of Ireland, playing seven dates across the island. Brady is a highly respected musician and teacher. A fluid and versatile drummer with a great sense of swing, he can play anything from funk to free jazz, but he is primarily influenced by some of the pioneering American drummers of the 1950s and 1960s, including Tony Williams, Max Roach, Jimmy Cobb, Art Taylor and Elvin Jones – as well as the irresistible polyrhythms of Afro-Cuban and Brazilian music. “In the 20 years I’ve been coming to Ireland, Kevin’s the best drummer I’ve heard,” Carrothers says. As a side musician and group anchor, Brady, who is 51, has become exceptionally popular with bands both in Ireland and abroad. At home he has been a crucial member of groups led by the guitarist Tommy Halferty, the pianist Phil Ware and the keyboardist Scott Flanigan, and by the saxophonists Richie Buckley and Meilana Gillard; in addition he has performed and recorded with Irish acts ranging from Van Morrison to the Irish Baroque Orchestra, Gráda to Dave Geraghty of Bell X1. [ Kevin Brady Electric Quartet: Plan B – an engrossing new musical directionOpens in new window ] Brady has also worked with the English jazz vocalists Norma Winstone and Ian Shaw, the American saxophonist and 1960s James Brown creative force Pee Wee Ellis, and the American guitarist and “godfather of fusion” Larry Coryell, among many others. “I try to bring an emotional response to any music I’m involved in, and an energy,” he says. “I want the music to be active.” He is also the composer of tight, melodically strong and rhythmically dynamic tunes that defy the lazy commonplace that drummers are there to keep time, not contribute original music. “The idea that if you play drums you’ve got no sense of cop-on with regard to knowing what a scale or a chord or a melody is … I think we’re way past that now,” he says. We meet in the recital room of Newpark Academy of Music, in Blackrock in south Dublin – “this room has been the venue for masterclasses by many great visiting jazz musicians, including the drummer Art Blakey,” he says – where Brady has been teaching drums for approaching 25 years; he is also head of the jazz programme at the school and lectures on the BA jazz degree course at Dublin City University. For participants who range from toddlers to final-year secondary students, Newpark is “the gold standard of musical education in Ireland”; founded in 1979, it is a registered charity with 42 staff and 600 students. Hozier is one of its alumni. Last year, at short notice, it was threatened with closure. Brady was one of the leaders of the campaign that saved the centre; from September the academy will transfer to new, though as yet unannounced, premises nearby. “I think people saw the importance of what’s been achieved here, both in the past and for the future,” Brady says. “If you start closing down music schools that have legacies like Newpark, then that’s not a world I would like to be living in.” Brady was born in Dublin. Neither of his parents was a musician, though his father sang in local musical societies, had a large vinyl collection and was a passionate fan of big-band jazz, as well as of the artistry of the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and the singer Sarah Vaughan. He began private piano lessons at the age of six, progressing through to the highest grades; a couple of years later he began playing trumpet, and later cornet, in a local concert band that sometimes toured Europe. In his teenage years Brady began playing keyboards in local jam bands, moving to drums “purely by coincidence” when one drummer failed to show for a rehearsal. He began teaching himself, initially falling under the influence of Stewart Copeland, the multifaceted American drummer from The Police, and at 17 began lessons at Newpark with the drummer Conor Guilfoyle. “I remember Kevin being a really good student with a voracious appetite to learn; like he is now, he was a complete enthusiast,” Guilfoyle says. “He wasn’t playing jazz at this point, more funk and rock, but he had a really good time feel. And that’s essential. It means you can adapt to many different styles of music – and also that good musicians will always want to play with you.” Increasingly drawn towards jazz – one of the earliest sparks was the present his father gave him for Christmas when he was 13: Wynton Marsalis’s Marsalis Standard Time, Vol 1 – he gave up a place studying classical music at University College Dublin in favour of a life practising, taking private lessons and playing blues and rock gigs. When he was 22, on Guilfoyle’s advice, he studied for six months at the prestigious Drummers Collective in New York; shortly after he took the year-long newly formed professional musician training course at Newpark set up by Ronan and Conor Guilfoyle. He has never looked back. Since then, over the past quarter-century or more, he has led an exemplary jazz life in Ireland, albeit one that has not exactly made him wealthy. He has admirably sought to advance his skills by studying with drummers and percussionists in the United States, Cuba and Brazil. And, from his early 30s, he has led bands and developed a reputation for being enterprising and hardworking, for being the kind of musician who consistently makes things happen. “His determination and discipline towards grant writing and procuring gigs is pretty legendary. He’s a dog on a bone,” Carrothers says. As a linchpin of the domestic music scene, Brady is also extremely well placed to gauge the state of jazz in Ireland. “I think it’s pretty healthy,” he says, quick as a flash. “Most nights, in Dublin at least, you’re going to be able to hear great live jazz featuring both established and younger musicians. “But one thing we’re lacking as a major capital in Europe is a government-backed centre for jazz and improvised music,” he adds. “Somewhere with a 300- to 400-seat venue, education and outreach programmes, resources, an archive, all sorts of stuff that would promote and preserve the music. Something like classical music has in the National Concert Hall and trad has with Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. [ Newpark Academy of Music saved from closure through licence reprieveOpens in new window ] “I know the audience is there, 100 per cent. As is the interest in jazz; I can see it in my students. But we need to follow through and take the initiative, take the next step. A dedicated venue would be a massive bonus not just for jazz in Ireland but for the whole country.” The Kevin Brady Electric Quartet plays the Yeats Building, Sligo, on Sunday, May 4th; Magy’s Farm, Dromara, Co Down, on Monday, May 5th; Riverbank Arts Centre, Newbridge, Co Kildare, on Wednesday, May 7th; Solstice Arts Centre, Navan, on Thursday, May 8th; Wexford Arts Centre on Friday, May 9th; Arthur’s Blues & Jazz Club, Dublin, on Saturday, May 10th; and Triskel Christchurch, Cork, on Friday, May 16th. The Kevin Brady Trio with Bill Carrothers and Dave Redmond plays Bray International Jazz Festival on Friday, May 2nd, and City of Derry Jazz Festival on Saturday, May 3rd © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Charlamagne tells Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer to 'cut it out' over hypocritical oligarchy concerns

CNN panelists were unimpressed by Sen. Chuck Schumer touting a "very strong letter" he wrote to President Trump over his attacks on Harvard University. Charlamagne tha God called out Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for hypocrisy over their sudden concern about big money in politics. "I think it's ridiculous even when they try to say things, you know, all these conversations about oligarchy, oligarchy, oligarchy," Charlamagne said on "The Breakfast Club" Monday. "Now Bernie [Sanders] and AOC, they can go out there and say, ‘Fight the oligarchy.’ Hakeem Jeffries, you can't say that, okay, like, cut it out, we know that you've taken so much money from corporate donors." "So, it's just weird to see them, you know, push back against oligarchy now and say, 'Look at the billionaires controlling Trump.' It's like, really? You, Hakeem, really? Chuck Schumer, really?" Charlamagne added. According to OpenSecrets.org, some of Schumer’s biggest donations come from corporations, including Blackstone Group, Nextera Energy, Newmark Group, and L3Harris Technologies. SCHUMER REFUSES TO RULE OUT IMPEACHMENT: ‘TRUMP IS VIOLATING RULE OF LAW IN EVERY WAY’ Charlamagne tha God is schooling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries over what he calls their sudden apportion to big money in politics. (Getty Images) Previous reporting from Fox News Digital found that Democracy PAC II, tied to George Soros, gave $2.5 million to Schumer’s Senate Majority PAC in 2024. Democracy PAC II also gave $3.5 million in calendar year 2022, and $2.5 million in calendar year 2021, for a total of $6 million. Jeffries’ profile on OpenSecrets.org is similar, with some of his largest donations coming from BlackRock Inc and Lockheed Martin. Furthermore, in February, Politico reported that Jeffries met privately with major donors in Silicon Valley. "I know there are some people that think Joe Biden should help rebuild because, as the most recent president, he is the de facto leader of the party. And to those people, I’d like to say: Hunter, lay off the crack," Charlamagne joked. "So who’s supposed to be the leaders? Well, in Congress, you’ve got two people. The first one is this guy, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries." He then showed a video of Jeffries wearing a suit with no tie and sunglasses outside the U.S. Capitol Building, talking about democracy. Charlamagne then called Schumer "Payless Obama’s counterpart in the Senate," and said that he was "even less inspiring." Charlamagne has been critical of the two Congressional Democrat minority leaders before, recently mocking them as party leaders and saying they should be "thrown out of office."

Cory Booker, D-N.J., held a sit-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to protest President Donald Trump's budget bill and cuts they claim will be made to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Fox News Digital reached out to Schumer and Jeffries for comment, but did not immediately receive a response. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rachel del Guidice is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

(NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 – March 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the AppLovin class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APP Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about e.l.f. Beauty, investors suffered damages. For more information on the e.l.f. Beauty class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELF Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: August 8, 2023 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day.

("Rocket Lab" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: RKLB) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Rocket Lab investors have until April 28, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. Rocket Lab is an aerospace company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, the defendants made false or misleading statements and failed to disclose that Rocket Lab’s three planned barge landing tests faced significant delays. A critical potable water issue, essential for launch pad preparation, would not be resolved until January 2026, creating a substantial risk that the Neutron rocket would not launch as planned in mid-2025. Additionally, Neutron’s only contract was secured at a discount with an unreliable partner. The lawsuit further claims that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” alleging that Rocket Lab had misled investors about the likelihood of a mid-2025 Neutron launch. Following this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price dropped nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.

Oppenheimer cut its price target price for Amazon (AMZN) shares by 15%, predicting that tariffs would eat into the profits of the company's e-commerce arm. Oppenheimer revised its relatively bullish target price of $260 down to $220—9% below the average estimate among analysts who track Amazon and are polled by Visible Alpha. Still, Oppenheimer analysts issued an “outperform” rating of Amazon stock in a research note Sunday, days before the company is scheduled to post its first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Paying tariffs likely will result in lower profit margins on e-commerce sales as Amazon protects its market share by keeping prices competitive, the analysts said. They expect investors to remain satisfied with mid- to high-teens growth at AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing platform, “even if margins contract meaningfully” on the e-commerce side of the company, the note said. Oppenheimer’s target is 16% above where Amazon shares closed Friday. Company shares have fallen nearly 15% over the course of 2025 amid a broad market sell-off spurred by tariffs. Amazon stock remains about 4% above prices a year ago. At close on Monday, the stock was off less than 1% at $187.70. Analysts have curbed their estimates for Amazon in recent weeks, citing tariffs’ potential to weigh on e-commerce sales and advertising revenue. The company is scheduled to release its first-quarter results after the bell on Thursday. Analysts expect the company to report about $155 billion in revenue, up 8% year-over-year, according to consensus estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. They anticipate $14.7 billion in profit, a 41% jump from the first quarter in 2024, per Visible Alpha.

Title: Man (66) who died while cycling was ‘meticulous’ in wearing safety equipment, inquest hears

A 66-year-old man who was “meticulous” in wearing safety equipment when cycling died from a severe brain injury after falling from his bike, an inquest has heard. A sitting of Dublin District Coroner’s Court heard that Conor Kenny, the head of a consultancy firm and author of several business books, died hours after setting off for a cycle to Ticknock woods in south Dublin. Judith Kenny said her husband, who was a regular runner and cyclist, was “meticulous” about safety equipment, which he was wearing when he left for his cycle on August 4th, 2024. She recalled ringing her husband several times after hearing “concerning” sirens near their home in Ballinteer in the hours after he left. Neville O’Connor, who was hiking on the day of Mr Kenny’s death, recalled seeing a cyclist pass him at a “fairly good speed” shortly before 1.30pm. After Mr Kenny rounded a bend ahead and was out of sight, Mr O’Connor heard a “very loud bang like a bike hitting the ground”. He said there were no cars in the area at the time. He ran to Mr Kenny who was still wearing his helmet, lying on the ground close to his bike and struggling to breathe. Mr O’Connor said he administered CPR until paramedics arrived and transferred him to St Vincent’s University Hospital. Dr Patrick Hillery, a consultant in emergency medicine, said Mr Kenny arrived in cardiac arrest. After all possible avenues were exhausted, he was pronounced deceased some 35 minutes later, the doctor said. He noted a significant volume of blood in Mr Kenny’s mouth “which would be consistent with an unprotected fall”. He believed Mr Kenny may have suffered a cardiac arrest before the fall. Garda Jason McDonnell, a member of the roads policing unit at Blackrock Garda station, said Mr Kenny’s smartwatch recorded a “sharp and sudden” drop in speed from 13.06 metres per second (47km/h) to 0 metres per second at 1.28pm. Garda McDonnell said the brakes and tyres of Mr Kenny’s bike were in good working order, and the site of the crash “wouldn’t be an area where you would have road traffic collisions”. A postmortem recorded the medical cause of death as severe craniocerebral trauma and noted a finding of amyloid angiopathy, a condition that causes bleeding into the brain, which could have caused a spontaneous bleed before his crash. Coroner Dr Clare Keane returned a narrative verdict, saying: “We are clear there was a fall from the bicycle, what we cannot conclude with certainty is whether the bleeding resulted from the fall or possibly precipitated it.” Jack White is a reporter for The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Writer announces Palmyra X5 LLM with 1M token context window to power AI agents

Time Published: 2025-04-28T19:00:36Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 15:00 EDT / APRIL 28 2025 by Kyt Dotson Generative artificial intelligence startup Writer Inc. today released its newest state-of-the-art enterprise-focused large language model Palmyra X5, an adaptive reasoning model that features a 1 million-token context window. The company also said that it teamed up with Amazon Web Services Inc. to announce the availability of the new model on Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s fully managed service for building AI applications by providing access to LLMs and machine learning models. In an interview with SiliconANGLE, Matan-Paul Shetrit, director of product management at Writer, said Palmyra X5 was trained entirely using synthetic data and required just $1 million in graphics processing unit hours. “Writer has been a leader from very early on in the use of synthetic data, as well as techniques that allow us to cut down costs, like stopping training if we don’t see returns, which lets us push model pricing way down,” Shetrit said. With its 1 million-token large-context window, the model can ingest and comprehend extensive codebases or large numbers of documents simultaneously. It also enables multistep reasoning across actions, making it ideal for powering agentic AI workflows. “Palmyra X5 is the newest model that comes with a 1 million-token context window, which is one of the largest commercially available, and it’s amongst the fastest and cheapest large-context LLMs,” Shetrit said. “This is critical when it comes to building multi-agentic systems, where the responses need to be continuously fed back into the context window across multistep workflows.” Shetrit said that going forward, Writer will incorporate the 1 million-token context window into all of Writer’s Palmyra family of models. The model can read an entire 1 million-token prompt in about 22 seconds, and it can return individual function-calling turns in about 300 milliseconds. X5 performs with a pricing of 60 cents per 1 million input tokens and $6 per 1 million output tokens. Between the low latency and low cost, it permits the model to provide high-speed performance across long contexts while allowing enterprise users to perform numerous actions without costing too much. This is essential, especially for agentic workflows, which can quickly become costly and slow with multistep and multiturn AI generations. “If you’re thinking about enterprise use cases, they’re extremely complex and interacting with multiple third-party, external or internal systems, often in multistep flows,” Shetrit said. “Our focus isn’t on solving for one- or two-agent workflows. It’s on enabling enterprises to manage 10, 50, or even 100,000 agents all working alongside employees to drive real transformational change.” The release of Palmyra X5 follows Writer’s launch of AI HQ, a new centralized hub for teams to easily build, deploy and orchestrate AI agents. Shetrit described Palmyra X5 and the company’s family of other Palmyra models as powerful “brains” for agents. He said X5 delivers on the company’s vision for helping companies adapt to the agentic AI trend. “Palmyra represents a critical step forward for companies seeking to embed generative AI into their enterprise workflows,” said David Cushman, executive research leader at HFS Research Ltd. “Palmyra is purpose-built for agent development, API function calling, multimodal processing and custom enterprise AI applications. More importantly, it’s integrated into Writer’s end-to-end platform that balances scalability with transparency — a core demand from regulators and stakeholders alike.” Hundreds of enterprise companies already use Writer’s Palmyra family of LLMs internally and externally to power their AI capabilities, including Accenture Plc, Marriott International Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., Salesforce Inc. and The Vanguard Group Inc.

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN analysis Topic:Tariffs While Donald Trump focuses on trade deficits with other nations, the US budget deficit continues to grow. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) The turmoil on global markets has taken a breather ever since US President Donald Trump backed away from his grand plan to impose tariffs on almost every other country. Stock markets have recovered almost all the ground they lost in the aftermath of the Liberation Day chaos and even bond markets have scaled back the panic, with yields continuing to edge lower. But the turmoil is likely to resume soon. Consumers globally have scaled back spending, corporations are calibrating the extent to which earnings expectations need to be lowered, American retailers are bracing for shortages and economists now are tipping much lower global growth and the possibility of a US recession. That's because Mr Trump's main target, China, is still facing a broad-based tariff of 145 per cent, which effectively is a ban on Chinese imports. On-again-off-again tariffs and an intensifying trade war with China are taking their toll on ordinary Americans. Even if the China tariffs are halved, that would massively increase US costs and slow output across the globe. And, for what? The White House is convinced that America is a victim of half a century of unfair trade policies that have forced the American people to buy necessities from elsewhere and weakened its global position. According to the president: "It's not just China, the European Union, they ripped us off for many, many years and those days are over," he repeated over the weekend at a doorstop interview. So, is America being ripped off? And will tariffs fix the "problem"? Financial markets have recovered ground since the initial tariff shock and turbulence, but America's economic woes are far from settled. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) In Donald Trump's world, deficits are always bad and surpluses are always good. In isolation, it's an easy concept to sell to a deeply divided nation. You can point to a problem and then apportion blame. But it ignores the fact that the US economy has powered its way to global domination during this period. So, it can't be all bad. Most economists dismiss the idea that a trade deficit, even an ongoing one, is bad. America's trade deficit occurs for the simple reason that Americans have a lot of money to spend and they buy more from offshore than they sell to foreigners. No-one is forcing them to buy the stuff. It's not the fault of China, or that of Mexico or Canada for that matter. Wondering how Trump's new tariffs were calculated? It would be funny if it wasn't so serious. Last year, America exported $US4.8 trillion ($7.5 trillion) worth of goods and services and imported $US5.9 trillion in goods and services. That left a $US1 trillion gap, or deficit, which it financed by borrowing. Mostly, it is big corporations buying either finished goods to sell to US citizens or components they need to manufacture goods in the US. It isn't foreign governments behind a grand conspiracy to "rip off" Uncle Sam. It's American companies choosing to buy in goods from offshore. As economist Jeffrey Sachs notes: "Suppose that you go on a shopping binge, spending more than your earnings by running up credit-card debt. It's also worth noting that it is not all gimmicks and gadgets coming across the border. Often, it is high-end equipment needed for industry and specialist services. Put another way, America invests more money than it saves. Tariffs build a wall around your economy. Those walls protect local industry from outside competition and allow industries and firms that ordinarily wouldn't be able to compete to survive. The offset, however, is that consumers have to pay more. Importers pay the tariff and then pass on those higher costs to customers. Many products US shoppers buy are imported from China and now face steep tariffs. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Many Americans faced with the prospect of paying far more for imported goods may then switch back to locally-produced goods. But they would be buying items that they previously decided they couldn't afford. That means consumers will have less money to spend on other things and US economic growth is likely to slow. And the price hikes on imported goods means inflation will rise. Another downside is that businesses become accustomed to the protection and, with less competition, don't innovate, so falling behind the rest of the world. From toy brands to fashion labels, some Australian firms are facing tariffs way above the 10 per cent "baseline". There are other issues as well. As we saw in recent weeks, as soon as the US announced the tariffs, those on the receiving end retaliated. That makes it harder for US suppliers to sell into foreign markets. So, while American firms may end up selling more product to Americans, their offshore sales are likely to slump. Any benefit they may have received from being protected at home will be eliminated by penalties in their export markets. This Boeing jet landed back in Seattle, Washington after being returned by a Chinese airline last week. (Reuters: David Ryder) The same goes for foreign firms — offshore sales will fall, which means global growth, not just America's, will slow. While the president bangs on about goods, he rarely mentions services. America exports a large amount of services to the rest of the world. In this area, it racks up a surplus. We're talking about things like education, tourism, software and information services. While the surplus is not enough to overcome the deficit in tradeable goods, the recent tariff hits have enraged other countries and seen a marked drop in foreign students wanting to enter the US, as well as an international backlash from tourists. As a result, the US trade deficit is likely to deteriorate as a result of the tariffs. America doesn't just run a trade deficit. It also runs a massive internal or budget deficit — and that is a far bigger problem. Years of handing out tax cuts to the extremely rich and vast overspending on defence has seen ongoing US budget deficits. You need to borrow to finance that, so the national debt has blown out to 122 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Tesla boss Elon Musk will cut back on his commitment to the Trump administration's DOGE and recommit to the carmaker, in a move cheered by investors after what analysts have called a "disaster" result. Those deficits continue to grow — during Trump's first term, he added $US8 trillion to the now bulging $US36.2 trillion in national debt, mostly through tax cuts. Joe Biden added a similar amount with his Inflation Reduction Act. America now spends more on servicing that debt each year than it spends on defence and the interest bill is the second biggest expense after social security. The White House often incorrectly mentions the national debt as being caused by the trade deficit which it then uses to justify tariffs. But if the tariffs cause GDP growth to slide or, worse, turn negative, then that debt situation could suddenly turn toxic. That's now becoming a real threat as large numbers of economists tip a US recession this year. Even worse, if the tariffs add to inflation and cause higher interest rates, servicing the debt will cost even more and the American economy could end up in serious trouble. America's financial stability has already been called into question by global investors. In the past month, they not only dumped Wall Street stocks, they abandoned US government bonds and the US dollar as well, a previously unimaginable set of events. While the Trump administration has taken aim at the US budget, hacking away at essential government services, it is looking at another massive tax cut for the wealthy which could further undermine the national finances. Globalisation was supposed to usher in a new era of wealth for the planet. Poorer countries would advance into the upper ranks more quickly and developed countries would reap the benefits. Many of those things came to pass, at least on paper. The problem was that the riches weren't doled out fairly. And the US was among the worst in shuffling the benefits through to the uber-rich. Wealth inequality blew out during the past half century. America may be rich on paper but the gap between the haves and the have-nots has widened into a yawning chasm. Mortality rates have risen, life expectancy has dropped, crime and incarceration levels have soared. The chaotic and hasty introduction of protectionism won't solve those problems. It could make them worse.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 28, 2025 14:42 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP APP Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact the Firm Before May 5th Deadline SAN FRANCISCO, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: How Stablecoins And Tokenization Are Rebuilding Global Finance

BySandy Carter BySandy Carter, Contributor. Stablecoins and tokenization take center stage. (Photo by May James/SOPA Images/LightRocket via ... More Getty Images) Late last year, I stood on stage at a fintech summit in Singapore talking about digital identity, stablecoins and tokenization, surrounded by leaders from central banks, blockchain startups, and AI innovators. It was one of those moments where you could feel history nudging forward. Discussions that used to live in niche corners of crypto Twitter were now center stage — about programmable money, the fragility of global currencies, and the reinvention of financial infrastructure. There was an electricity in the air, not of fear, but of change. What struck me most was the shared understanding across sectors: the old financial rails weren’t just aging. They were being replaced, reimagined, and rebuilt. Later in 2025, at a Digital Economist event with financial researcher Tarun Kishnani, we dug deeper into what’s really happening underneath the surface. This isn’t about headlines or hype. It’s about a fundamental rewiring of the architecture that underpins global commerce and power. Much of this transformation can be traced back to an imbalance that has been growing for decades. Over reliance on foreign manufacturing, ballooning trade deficits, and geopolitical tensions have chipped away at the U.S.’s unchallenged monetary position. In just the past few months, the Dollar has weakened more than 10% against a basket of global currencies — not because people stopped believing in the U.S. entirely, but because uncertainty is being priced in at the margins. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, warned that adversaries are actively working to dismantle the Dollar’s hegemonic role. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said what once would have been controversial: that U.S. debt mismanagement could erode the Dollar’s reserve status. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) The U.S. has long preserved Dollar dominance by keeping global demand high — from oil pricing to trade settlement systems. But the new levers of power are digital, decentralized, and dynamic. One of the clearest signals that global finance is evolving is the astonishing rise of stablecoins. In 2024 alone, stablecoins processed over $27 trillion in volume — more than Visa and Mastercard combined. Stablecoins are a category of digital assets designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their price to a reserve asset, most commonly the U.S. Dollar. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can fluctuate wildly in value, stablecoins aim to offer the speed, transparency, and programmability of blockchain technology without the volatility. They are backed either by fiat currency reserves, commodities, or algorithmic mechanisms that manage supply and demand. Today, stablecoins like USDC and USDT serve as vital tools for global payments, trading, savings, and cross-border transactions — blending the trust of traditional finance with the efficiency of decentralized systems. Why are stablecoins growing so fast? They solve real-world problems. They offer instantaneous, low-cost transfers. They are transparent, programmable, and — in most cases — backed by U.S. Dollars. In a world increasingly skeptical of traditional intermediaries, stablecoins offer direct access to a stable financial anchor. As Tarun put it during our conversation, “Every time someone in Latin America or Southeast Asia loads USDC into a wallet, they’re extending the reach of the U.S. Dollar — without a single bank branch or military base.” Financial researcher Tarun Kishnani Stablecoins have become a new kind of financial infrastructure — invisible, efficient, and profoundly influential. While the surface of finance looks much the same — banks, apps, payments — the underlying rails are being transformed. SWIFT’s ISO 20022 upgrade is modernizing cross-border messaging to support tokenized assets. China’s CIPS network is providing an alternative to SWIFT for emerging markets. Meanwhile, blockchain-based settlement layers like Ethereum are allowing assets to move at internet speed, without traditional banking bottlenecks. This evolution isn’t a tech experiment anymore. It’s a full-scale reengineering of how value moves around the world. It's laying the groundwork for a future where money flows like information — fast, borderless, and programmable. Many assume decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) are locked in a zero-sum battle. But what’s actually emerging is a collaboration. Banks are experimenting with blockchain rails to streamline settlement and custody. DeFi platforms are embedding compliance features to attract regulated capital. The two systems are beginning to meet in the middle — with stablecoins acting as the connective tissue. Rather than disrupting for disruption's sake, this hybrid model is focused on resilience, innovation, and access. It’s not about breaking finance. It’s about upgrading it. Tokenization — the conversion of real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens — is moving from pilot projects into real deployment. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, put it succinctly: “Tokenization brings Wall Street efficiency to Main Street access.” Already, we’re seeing tokenized U.S. Treasuries gaining traction among global institutions looking for dollar exposure without the friction of traditional custody. Real estate platforms are tokenizing properties, allowing fractional ownership that enables more diverse participation. Corporates are beginning to tokenize debt instruments to reduce settlement times and financing costs. The potential is staggering: 24/7 markets, instant settlement, broader participation, and increased liquidity. And most of these assets are priced in Dollars — reinforcing the very monetary system many predicted would wane. Beyond the technical benefits, this new financial infrastructure could redefine access to opportunity. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, emphasized this broader mission: “This is our opportunity to build financial systems that don’t just work better—but work for more people.” Stablecoins and tokenized assets open doors for billions of people left behind by traditional banking. A farmer in Kenya can save in a stable currency. A startup founder in Vietnam can raise global capital. A student in Argentina can invest in tokenized U.S. equities. The goal isn’t just efficiency. It’s equity. It’s about creating systems that are open by design, not as an afterthought. Of course, this future is not without its challenges. Digital identity remains a crucial missing piece — without verifiable, portable identity, trust in ownership breaks down. Regulatory clarity is lagging behind technological innovation, leading to uncertainty for businesses and users alike. Technical risks — from smart contract vulnerabilities to blockchain outages — are real and must be managed with rigor. Moreover, the U.S.’s fiscal and political stability will continue to underpin Dollar confidence. Digital diplomacy through stablecoins is powerful, but it still rests on trust in the core institutions behind them. As you navigate this financial transformation with Stablecoins and Tokenization, the takeaway is clear: participation is no longer optional. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, an investor, a policymaker, or simply someone managing personal finances, understanding how stablecoins, tokenized assets, and digital infrastructure work will soon be as fundamental as understanding credit cards or online banking. If you’re a business leader, now is the time to modernize infrastructure and explore how digital assets could streamline operations, reduce costs, and open new markets. If you’re an investor, learning how tokenization is reshaping access to real estate, bonds, and global equities could uncover new opportunities for diversification and growth. And if you’re a policymaker, the moment demands thoughtful regulation that encourages innovation while protecting stability and inclusion. For individuals, the implications are profound. Financial systems are opening in ways that will create more access, more ownership, and more agency for people worldwide — but only for those who engage early. Saving, investing, and transacting with digital tools will move from experimental to expected. The rails are being rebuilt around you. The next chapter of finance will be more borderless, transparent, and participatory than any that came before. The best time to start understanding this shift was yesterday. The second-best time is today. What do you think about Stablecoins and Tokenization?

Title: Watch These Meta Stock Price Levels Ahead of Facebook Parent's Earnings

Time Published: 2025-04-28T17:59:53Z

Meta (META) shares were holding steady Monday as the Facebook and Instagram parent prepares to report first-quarter results after Wednesday’s closing bell. Investors will be paying close attention to the social media giant's ad revenue outlook, amid concerns of a broader slowdown in digital advertising spending by Chinese companies as the U.S. and China impose lofty tariffs on one another. Legal and regulatory disputes have nagged Meta, with the E.U. recently fining the tech giant for violating its Digital Markets Act and an antitrust trial getting underway in the U.S. Coming into the week, Meta shares were down about 7% for so far in 2025, though they have outperformed their Magnificent Seven peers over the period, boosted by the company’s significant investment in AI driving advertising growth and user engagement across its suite of apps. The stock was down fractionally at around $547 in mid-afternoon trading Monday. Below, we take a closer look at Meta’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors may be eyeing. Meta shares have forged two closely aligned troughs during April, potentially setting the stage for a double bottom, a chart pattern that indicates a bullish reversal. More recently, the stock has undergone a pre-earnings bounce, with the price forming a doji in Friday’s trading session to signal indecision among buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) points to neutral conditions, providing a reading around the 50 threshold. Let’s identify several important support and resistance levels on Meta's chart. Investors should initially keep track of the $482 level. A pullback to this area would likely attract buying interest near the prominent April troughs that form the potential double bottom pattern. It’s worth pointing out that this location also sits in the same neighborhood as the 38.2% Fibonacci retirement level when applying a grid from the February high to April low. Selling below this key level could see the shares retreat to around $452. This area may provide support near swing lows that developed on retracements toward the 200-day moving average in July and August last year. A pre-earnings bump could trigger buying to the $588 level. Investors may view this area as a high probability location to lock in profits near a trendline that links the early-April countertrend rally with a series of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to December last year. Finally, a close above this level would confirm the double bottom pattern and potentially spark a move up to $632. Meta shares may run into overhead selling pressure in this region near multiple peaks that formed on the chart between December and March.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares led losses on the Dow and S&P 500 Monday afternoon following a report China's Huawei Technologies is preparing to test a rival artificial intelligence chip. According to The Wall Street Journal, Huawei "is gearing up to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, which the company hopes could replace some higher-end products" from Nvidia. Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said that "Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D." Shares of Nvidia, which declined to comment on the report, were down close to 4% in recent trading. They've lost a fifth of their value since the start of the year, and have yet to fully recover from their plunge on Jan. 27 that wiped nearly $600 billion from the company's market cap when Chinese startup DeepSeek said its models rivaled those of OpenAI's Chat GPT at a fraction of the cost.

As it develops satellite-based cellular connectivity, AST SpaceMobile has reached an agreement designed to prevent the company’s massive BlueBird satellites from interfering with astronomy. On Monday, the Texas-based company signed a “coordination agreement” with the US National Science Foundation (NSF). The deal calls for AST to “implement best practices between satellite communications and ground-based optical, infrared, and radio astronomy observations. “Under this agreement, AST SpaceMobile commits to collaborate closely with NSF, its major facilities, and the broader US astronomy community to mitigate any potential impact on ground-based astronomical facilities,” the company added. Importantly, AST has committed to adopting recommendations from the International Astronomical Union’s Dark and Quiet Skies initiative (IAU/CPS), which formed in 2022 in response to the rise of “mega” satellite constellations. This includes SpaceX’s Starlink, which has incorporated various design changes to prevent the satellites from reflecting sunlight in the night sky. In AST’s case, the company’s first-generation BlueBird satellites already feature a vast, 693-square-foot communications array. As a result, the satellites can appear as bright stars in the night sky, according to astronomers. The interference risk may grow more serious since AST plans to launch dozens of even larger, second-generation BlueBirds, each 2,400 square feet. But on Monday, CEO Abel Avellan said the agreement with NSF underscores its “commitment to responsible stewardship of space.” AST didn’t elaborate on what measures it’ll take to prevent such interference. But in January, the company sent a letter to the FCC that noted it plans on rolling or tilting its satellites “to avoid direct illumination of optical telescopes." AST also wants to install new antennas designed to reduce the satellites' brightness. Despite the agreement, Anthony Mallama, a retired astronomer who studies satellites for their brightness, told PCMag that he's skeptical the coordination deal will make a major difference. "The AST BlueBird Block 1 spacecraft are currently the brightest constellation by far with an average apparent magnitude of 3.3," he said. "That is 30 times brighter than the limit recommended by the IAU/CPS. The forthcoming Block 2 satellites will be 3 times the size of Block 1. So, they may outshine every star in the sky." In the meantime, the NSF agreement is important not only for astronomers but also for AST’s efforts to receive further regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission. In the past, the FCC has conditioned Starlink satellite approvals on working with the NSF to prevent interference with astronomy research. Last week, SpaceX even criticized AST’s request to launch a prototype second-generation BlueBird, the FM-1, saying the company had yet to explain how it would prevent the satellite from interfering with optical astronomy. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.

CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/applovin-corporation-loss-submission-form/?id=145080&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: May 10, 2023 to March 26, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Female data scientist is using a digital tablet with graphical electronic circuit projection The U.S. tech sector is contending with a combination of innovation along with job instability. The vibe is resilient, but anxious. A U.S. News survey shows 80% of tech workers report job satisfaction. They cite high pay and impact, but posts on the X platform reveal growing pessimism, with 65% of tech workers surveyed by The Information expecting worse conditions, driven by layoffs and hiring pullbacks. Drawing on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Forbes, Layoffs.fyi, and executive search firm Robert Half, alongside sentiment from the vocal X platform, here’s a snapshot of the tech sector’s pulse. This includes the range of what’s happening in the job market to dream employers and the daily grind. The BLS projects 356,700 annual tech job openings through 2033, signaling growth, especially in AI and fintech, where financial services now attract 22% of Cornell’s computer science graduates, up from 16% in 2022. US tech professionals are drawn to companies like NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Salesforce, Adobe, and Netflix for their innovation, competitive pay, and supportive cultures. These employers offer the chance to work on transformative technologies, grow professionally, and enjoy flexible, inclusive workplaces. Tech workers rank companies like Oracle, Amazon, and FIS Global highly, per Forbes’ 2024 Best Employers for Tech Workers, based on about 25,000 surveyed employees. Oracle’s supportive culture and Amazon’s mentorship programs shine, offering competitive pay, $142,000–$210,000 along with generous bonuses, stock options, and growth. Robert Half’s 2025 Salary Guide notes only 41% of tech workers are satisfied with pay, averaging $112,521, though AI-skilled professionals earn a 17.7% premium. A Dice report highlights 47% of tech workers are actively seeking new roles, driven by underpayment or lack of flexibility. Layoffs make job searches tougher. Still, over 7 million job postings in 2025, a 33% jump, per Dice, show opportunities persist for skilled candidates. AI engineering roles are emerging as the top hiring priority. U.S. tech managers are hiring for AI engineer positions. This surge in AI-focused recruitment is complemented by a growing need for full-stack engineers, who play a crucial role in building AI systems. The most sought-after jobs include AI engineers, cloud architects, and cybersecurity analysts. AI engineers, leveraging Python and TensorFlow, earn $150,000–$300,000 plus bonuses and stock, per Glassdoor. Cloud architects average $148,821, and cybersecurity analysts, vital amid digital threats, earn $120,000–$200,000, according to Robert Half. Work-from-home policies are shrinking. Robert Half finds only 18% of 2025 tech roles are fully remote, clashing with 46% of workers unwilling to return onsite full-time. Hybrid models dominate, with companies offering commute perks to lure workers back, per Crunchbase. This shift frustrates many, as flexibility remains a top priority, per Harvey Nash’s 2024 report. Life as a tech worker is dynamic but demanding. Many juggle upskilling in AI or cloud computing, with 87% of hiring leaders valuing AI experience, per ResumeTemplates.com. Long hours, especially in startups, contrast with perks like mental wellness support at firms like CoreWeave. However, the BLS projects 356,700 annual tech job openings through 2033, driven by AI and fintech growth. Financial services now attract 22% of Cornell’s computer science graduates, up from 16% in 2022, reflecting shifting priorities toward fintech innovation. The tech industry, heavily reliant on global supply chains, faces significant challenges from the 2025 tariffs. Companies like Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA, which depend on manufacturing in China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, are grappling with increased costs for imported hardware, semiconductors, and consumer electronics. The Consumer Technology Association projects that tariffs could reduce U.S. consumer purchasing power by $90–143 billion, with potential declines in laptop and tablet purchases by up to 68% and smartphones by 37%. This drop in demand threatens revenue for hardware giants and e-commerce platforms, as seen in stock price drops. Business woman working in an incredible futuristic and original office space, looking at her phone, ... More worried about layoffs The tech industry faced significant workforce reductions, with Layoffs.fyi reporting that 50,728 employees were let go across 111 tech companies. This wave of layoffs, while less intense than the peak of 2023, reflects ongoing adjustments within the sector as companies navigate economic shifts, technological advancements, and strategic realignments. Among the companies leading these layoffs, Intel stands out with its announcement to cut approximately 22,000 jobs, representing 20% of its workforce. This move, the largest tech layoff of the year, underscores the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry. Meta followed with a reduction of 3,600 workers, roughly 5% of its staff, framing the cuts as a push to enhance productivity and eliminate underperforming roles. STMicro, another player in the electronics and semiconductor space, laid off 3,000 employees, grappling with market headwinds. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) trimmed 2,500 jobs, about 5% of its workforce, after a 19% drop in its stock price in the first quarter of 2025. Workday, a software firm, reduced its headcount by 1,750, or 8.5%, to redirect resources toward artificial intelligence initiatives. Microsoft also contributed to the trend, eliminating 2,280 roles across divisions like cloud services and mixed reality as part of performance-driven restructuring. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation has reshaped priorities. Firms are channeling significant investments into AI development, automating tasks previously handled by human workers. This shift has rendered roles in areas like software engineering, human resources, and support teams redundant, as evidenced by cuts at Stack Overflow and Salesforce. Despite robust profits at some tech giants, high interest rates, inflation, and investor demands for leaner operations have pushed companies to prioritize cost-cutting. Meta and Microsoft, for instance, have used layoffs to bolster stock prices and strengthen their financial positions. Many firms are restructuring to focus on high-growth areas such as AI and cybersecurity, as seen in Cisco’s strategic pivot away from less profitable segments. A concerning dynamic is at play. Once one or two top tier tech companies announce layoffs, it follows up with a copycat effect where companies also start laying off people too.

Title: Nvidia faces a new threat from Huawei

Chinese tech giant Huawei is getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), according to a new report. Huawei Technologies will receive its first shipment of Ascend 910E chips from manufacturers as soon as the end of May, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The processor is Huawei’s most powerful AI semiconductor to date. According to the report, Huawei is hopeful that the chips will be more powerful than Nvidia’s H100 AI training chip, which it released in 2022. The Shenzhen-based firm boosts the chip’s performance by packing in more silicon. Shares of Nvidia were down about 3.5% by late Monday morning. The chip is in the early stages of development and will need to undergo testing with an initial batch of customers to measure its performance, the sources said. Huawei, one of China’s biggest tech companies, has made persistent technological advances in recent years despite U.S. sanctions against it. The firm has been on a U.S.-trade blacklist for six years, and the U.S. restricts chipmakers from selling certain chip technologies to Chinese firms in an effort to curb the country’s advancements with AI chip technology. The tightening restrictions under both the Biden and Trump administrations have dealt blows to Nvidia by limiting its potential market. Nvidia designed its H20 chip, in particular, to comply with U.S. export rules — but those rules became even stricter and barred the Santa Clara, California-based company from selling them in China. Beijing has slammed the U.S.’ approach and President Donald Trump’s attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. Earlier this month, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries “at the expense of China,” framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. Nvidia is the world’s most valuable chipmaker with a market capitalization of about $2.6 trillion. But its shares are down 22.5% this year in the face of Trump’s escalating trade war with China. —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

The grant will also give $720,000 for scholarships from the TCSGF’s ‘Last Mile Fund,’ to help students graduate despite potential financial burdens. “This partnership with The BlackRock Foundation is a powerful investment in Georgia’s future workforce,” Greg Dozier, Commissioner of the Technical College System of Georgia, said. “By helping more students complete training and earn credentials—especially in rural communities and high-demand fields—we’re not only changing lives, we’re building the talent pipeline that keeps Georgia the number one state for business." Dozier said the Empowerment Fund was a good example of how public and private partnerships can expand opportunities across Georgia, help close skill gaps and support economic mobility.

Title: Looking beyond Pi Network? 5 underrated cryptos could 1000x in May’s bullish rebound

As the crypto market gears up for a potential surge, interest is shifting toward hidden digital assets with explosive growth prospects. Investors are eager to uncover the next big opportunity beyond well-known names. This article delves into five overlooked cryptocurrencies that might experience a hundredfold increase during May’s bullish momentum. XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key strengths of XYZVerse in the current market: Price prediction for $XYZ Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Is a 3000% surge possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Ondo Finance is changing how people access financial products. By blending traditional finance with blockchain, Ondo turns real-world assets into digital tokens. These assets are stable and earn income, like US Treasuries. This opens up high-quality financial products to more people. Ondo has two parts: one creates these tokenized products, and the other builds decentralized finance tools. Together, they enhance Ondo’s offerings. In a market where trust is key, Ondo partners with firms like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for asset custody. They prioritize transparency and legal compliance. Their product, USDY, combines the ease of a stablecoin with yield opportunities. Backed by US Treasuries, it’s a secure option for non-US investors. With many cryptocurrencies being volatile, USDY offers a stable and regulated alternative. Compared to others, its strong backing makes it attractive for those seeking stability and steady returns. Sui is a new blockchain platform designed to change the way we interact with Web3. Built as a layer-1 blockchain, Sui focuses on being secure, powerful, and able to grow. It uses a special object-centric data model and the Move programming language to fix problems found in other blockchains. This means Sui can handle more transactions quickly and safely, making it ready for global use. What sets Sui apart is its focus on the user experience. It removes common barriers that make blockchain hard to use. Features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions make it easier for people to use apps without complicated steps. Programmable transaction blocks let developers create apps that are friendly and easy to use. In a market filled with many coins, Sui stands out because of its strong technology and user-first approach. This makes it an attractive option in today’s market, especially as more people look for blockchain platforms that are both powerful and easy to use. Imagine a blockchain designed just for trading, with speed and security at its core. That’s Sei. It’s the first Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for exchanges, giving them an edge over the competition. Sei can handle a huge number of orders every second, and transactions are finalized in just 380 milliseconds. That’s faster than most other blockchains out there. Plus, it’s backed by big institutions, ensuring it’s secure and reliable. With the potential to grow over 323% by 2030, Sei is catching the eye of many investors. In today’s market, where speed and efficiency are key, Sei stands out. While other coins struggle with slow transaction times, Sei offers a swift and secure alternative. If you’re looking at current trends, where decentralized finance and quick trades are in demand, Sei looks like an attractive option. It’s tailored for the trading world, and that specialization could give it an advantage in the market. Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform designed to make decentralized finance (DeFi) faster and more efficient. It introduces its own Layer 1 blockchain, built from scratch to be quick and scalable. One of its standout features is HyperBFT, a special system that helps transactions confirm rapidly while keeping them secure. What’s really exciting is that Hyperliquid offers decentralized perpetual futures trading directly on its platform. Users can trade without paying any gas fees, which are common charges on other networks. Plus, Hyperliquid uses an on-chain order book, meaning all trades are visible and verifiable on the blockchain, increasing transparency and trust. In today’s crypto market, platforms that offer speed, low costs, and transparency are highly sought after. Hyperliquid’s approach sets it apart from many other decentralized exchanges that still have issues with high fees and slower transactions. The team behind Hyperliquid comes from top universities and industry leaders, showing strong expertise and innovation. While the crypto market is always changing, Hyperliquid’s focus on solving real problems could make it an attractive option for traders looking for efficient and cost-effective solutions. As more users seek better platforms for trading, Hyperliquid might become a key player in the DeFi space. In the current bull run, ONDO, SUI, SEI, and HYPE offer potential, but XYZVerse (XYZ) leads with its sports-meme fusion, targeting 20,000% growth and empowering a community-driven ecosystem.

Title: Best Altcoins to Buy as Strategy Buying Spree Is Turning Bitcoin Into a Premium Asset

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) currently owns an astounding 538,200 Bitcoin after it added a massive 379,800 $BTC in just the last six months. On average, the company has been acquiring 2,087 $BTC per day – a rate that far exceeds the current daily production rate of 450 $BTC, which comes to 13,500 $BTC per month. Keep reading to find out how institutional Bitcoin accumulation could reshape the market and why now might be a great opportunity to invest in the best altcoins to buy to benefit from this shift. By amassing such as dominant Bitcoin position, Strategy is moving toward a position where it could influence broader market trends. If institutions like Strategy control a sizable portion of Bitcoin’s fixed 21M supply, the asset may become a luxury in the future. In this environment, the $BTC cost of capital may no longer be driven by free market forces, but be increasingly shaped by the lending policies of major holders. Although this goes against Bitcoin’s decentralization ethos, it’s undeniably bullish for its price. Borrowing Bitcoin will become a luxury business reserved for nation-states and corporate whales, and Strategy will control the bottleneck. – Adam Livingston, a $BTC analyst Reinforcing this trend, more institutions are moving towards a Bitcoin corporate treasury plan. Blockstream CEO Adam Back even suggests this shift could eventually push Bitcoin’s market cap to $200T. Some critics warn that Strategy’s debt-funded Bitcoin buying could be risky. However, experts like Saifedean Ammous have said that institutional Bitcoin concentration does not threaten the currency’s protocol. Even if institutions control over 50% of the supply, they have no incentive to manipulate the protocol. Forking Bitcoin to create more coins would only devalue their holdings, leading to large losses. Bitcoin’s hard-capped supply remains fundamentally secure, and so does the long-term bullish case. If accumulation trends continue, Bitcoin’s scarcity could trigger explosive market movements. Smart investors are positioning now. Below, we highlight three of the best altcoins to buy that could surge alongside Bitcoin during a potential supply crunch. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is easily the best Bitcoin-centric altcoin on the market right now. Designed to follow the king cryptocurrency’s coattails, it’s the first-ever and only crypto to offer free Bitcoin to its token holders. All you have to do is store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. These $BTC airdrops will occur every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. As you can see, by doing so, BTC Bull Token has directly tied itself to Bitcoin’s growth. What’s more, the developers have also planned to shave off a part of the total token supply every time Bitcoin’s price increases by $25K. The first token burn event will take place when $BTC reaches $125K – then at $150K, $175K, $200K, and so on. Don’t miss out on one of the best cryptos to invest in now and buy $BTCBULL for just $0.002485 per token. Here’s a guide on how to buy it. A Bitcoin rally is highly likely to pull the entire crypto market along with it. With rising crypto prices across the board, it’d be the perfect time to be a crypto trader and investor. However, for the vast majority of us, finding high-potential tokens before they’ve taken off is an uphill task. That’s why you’re better off using MIND of Pepe ($MIND), an autonomous AI agent coin offering crypto investment advice. $MIND works by interacting with the crypto audience on decentralized applications and online platforms like X. It patiently listens to everyone’s opinion on crypto, punches every piece of unique data into its AI-powered hive-mind intelligence system, and finally identifies the next cryptos to explode. Over $8.4M in presale funding so far is proof that investors believe in AI’s newfound ability to analyze social sentiment trends, which the crypto market heavily relies on for explosive moves. If you buy $MIND today, you’ll have to spend just $0.0037465 per token. Mother Iggy launched towards the end of March and was more or less flat for the first three weeks. It sprung to new life in the last week or so and has since then jumped over nearly 250%. It’s currently the top-trending crypto in the entire market. As the name suggests, $MOTHER is based on the ultra-famous rapper Iggy Azalea, who is renowned for songs like Fancy, Work, and Money Come. Like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, $MOTHER, too, might not have a whole lot of fundamentals supporting it. But that is how it can be with meme coins backed by a celebrity. They enjoy massive hype and trading volume on account of the celebrity’s popularity. This ultimately leads to violent upmoves, i.e., if the token is lucky enough to be successful. $MOTHER is. Currently trading at just $0.01982, $MOTHER might just as well be in the early stages of a huge rally. With expectations for another $BROCCOLI-like run, it could be one of the best low cap coins to buy now. With Bitcoin poised to reclaim its all-time high and potentially rise further, the time is admittedly ripe to invest in some new cryptocurrencies like BTC Bull Token that could rise alongside $BTC. However, bear in mind that the crypto market is volatile and guarantees no returns. Finally, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice.

April 28, 2025 10:40 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited, an asset management firm and ETF sponsor that uses proprietary technology to provide low-cost, alternative strategies to a variety of investors, today published its Q1 2025 Hedge Fund Barometer, which showed a significant reversal of pro-growth positions in both U.S. equities and corporate bonds over the quarter as well as an increase in bets on gold. According to Unlimited’s proprietary technology, hedge fund managers came into the year with relatively low conviction and modest views but subsequently ramped up pro-growth positions including long the U.S. dollar, and credit spread and equity bets in line with increased expectations of U.S. growth from the new administration. The majority of those positions were reversed starting in February with the exception of extending bullish positions on gold. “Hedge fund positioning shows some of the lowest conviction in the direction of asset prices that we have seen in decades,” said Bob Elliott, CEO and CIO of Unlimited and portfolio manager of actively-managed ETFs. “Those positions were a dramatic transition from the beginning of the quarter when hedge funds were ramping up their bullish bets on the U.S. economy. The prominence of policy volatility likely triggered managers' reluctance to hold significant directional positions.” Hedge funds eked out modestly positive performance in the first quarter with the mix of sub-strategy returns largely reversing the moves of the previous quarter. Emerging Market funds outperformed meaningfully as Chinese stocks surged meanwhile Equity Long/Short and Event Driven strategies came in weak. 1Q25 Hedge Fund Strategy Performance, Gross of Fees Unlimited’s Hedge Fund Barometer showed other notable moves during the quarter included: Click here to view a video on how Unlimited’s technology works.

Title: What is the Inverse Cramer Meme? Jokes About Following the Opposite of Jim Cramer's Investment Advice, Explained

Matt Schimkowitz • 6 years ago Mateus Lima • about a month ago Owen Carry • 3 days ago Sakshi Rakshale • about a month ago Sakshi Rakshale • 2 months ago Published April 27, 2025 Jim Cramer is one of the most recognizable figures in American finance media, known for his energetic stock picks and bold predictions on CNBC's Mad Money. Over the years, however, a growing number of investors and internet users have noticed a pattern: Cramer's recommendations during crucial market moments have not performed well. In response, online communities developed the "Inverse Cramer" meme and slang term, a running joke and informal strategy suggesting that doing the opposite of Cramer’s advice could be more profitable. Here’s how the meme started, why it spread, and what it looks like today. Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money since March 2005, is infamous for dramatic, sometimes ill-fated investment advice. During the 2008 financial crisis, Cramer advised buying Bear Stearns, just weeks before it collapsed. He also encouraged holding onto Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers before their infamous downfalls. A clip of the show uploaded by YouTuber politiclips on March 17th, 2008, has over 500,000 views 17 years later. The Wall Street Journal first reported in 2009 that betting against Cramer’s "buys" could net a 25 percent return in a month. CBS News confirmed similar findings in 2012, with a 22 percent portfolio gain in just 22 days by doing the opposite. The "Inverse Cramer" meme suggests that one can succeed in the stock market simply by doing the opposite of Jim Cramer’s advice. While jokes about this date back to 2008, the phrase "Inverse Cramer" first surfaced on Twitter via @WSBConsensus on October 10, 2017, in a post about shorting NVIDIA and going long on AMD, which echoed in a popular /r/Amd thread on Reddit later that month. Don't forget the infamous "Inverse Cramer" Short $NVDA Long $AMD #BuyNVDAPuts #BuyAMDCalls $MU $APPL $GOOGL $HMNY https://t.co/9QUvAetUTv — WallStreetBets & Co. (@WSBConsensus) October 10, 2017 The idea found a home in online finance communities like the subreddit /r/WallStreetBets and FinTwit by 2019, where posts joking about "inversing" Cramer routinely earned hundreds to thousands of upvotes. As Cramer’s misfires piled up, the meme matured from a casual jab into a half-serious investment philosophy. On December 15th, 2021, Twitter user @iAnonPatriot posted a screenshot of Cramer tweeting negatively about AMC Entertainment stock. Despite Cramer’s warning, AMC’s share price rose significantly, leading @iAnonPatriot to caption it with sarcasm and highlight the inverse trend. The next day, on December 16th, Redditor /u/jsza87 posted to /r/wallstreetbets with the title "Always inverse Jim Cramer," gathering over 8,000 upvotes since. The post featured a collage of stock tickers that all declined sharply after Cramer had recommended them. By early March 2023, the joke had grown large enough that Redditor /u/HYPED_UP_ON_CHARTS announced, "The Inverse Jim Cramer ETF Has Officially Arrived," on /r/wallstreetbets. The post, which earned over 9,000 upvotes in the last two years, presented an ETF that allowed people to automatically short stocks recommended by Cramer. What started as a meme has turned into an actual, tradable financial strategy. The meme stayed relevant through new market events even into this year. For instance, on April 5th, 2025, after Cramer warned of a coming "Black Monday" stock crash, X user @fprosk joked, "We are really testing the limits of the Reverse Jim Cramer now," gathering over 50,000 likes in just a couple of days. Finally, the meme broke into even bigger mainstream attention when Elon Musk referenced it. On April 25th, 2025, after Jim Cramer said during a CNBC segment, "I'm putting my chips on Elon Musk," Musk responded on X with, "Uh oh 😬 Inverse Cramer is tough karma to overcome! I’m calling weekend reviews with Autopilot to accelerate progress." For the full history of Inverse Cramer, be sure to check out Know Your Meme's encyclopedia entry for more information.

Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Today, we have something special for you: A few days ago, I hosted a panel with FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit in Washington, DC. We recorded the discussion, and we’re bringing it to you today. That’s all pretty normal Decoder stuff, you might say — except these are anything but normal circumstances. Right off the bat, you’ll hear me even struggle to introduce them. Becca and Alvaro were FTC commissioners until very recently, when President Donald Trump fired them. The thing is, he doesn’t appear to have any legal authority to actually do that. As you’ll hear them discuss, by law the FTC needs to have commissioners from both political parties. Additionally, there’s a 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent that explicitly says the President can’t fire FTC commissioners in this way. So, given all that, they’re suing the administration to get their jobs back — and as you’ll hear, they are both committed to taking this case all the way to the Supreme Court. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! That puts them in a deeply weird, Schrödinger’s cat kind of position, for now: they both are and are not currently working as FTC commissioners, and that creates some strange tensions you’ll hear us get into. On top of all that, of course, there’s the actual work of the FTC going on. The antitrust trial against Meta was going on basically down the street from where I sat talking with Rebecca and Alvaro, so I spent some time asking how that case was going — and why Mark Zuckerberg’s donations to the inauguration and frequent appearances in the Oval Office haven’t seemed to dissuade the government from trying to break up Meta. You’ll hear Becca in particular point out that being bad at bribes still means the government is open for bribery and corruption, and that creates all kinds of other problems for the economy. There’s a lot going on in this conversation, from how the president fires you to the attempt in Silicon Valley to build AI into a digital god. We also somehow ended up taking printer recommendations from the audience. It’s a good one. Okay: liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Hi everybody. I am Nilay Patel. I’m the editor-in-chief of The Verge and host of the Decoder podcast. I have two excellent guests with me today. I’m going to say former Federal Trade Commission chairs. Alvaro Bedoya: That’s up to you. That’s your call. We would politely disagree. Rebecca Slaughter: We would not say that. Current liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Welcome, thank you for being here. RS: Thanks for having us. I have a million questions for the both of you. Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Normally, in a conversation about privacy and consumer protection with FTC commissioners, it would be a fairly predictable set of topics, especially now with AI. It is not a predictable time in America. It is not a predictable set of circumstances. Let’s start with your status with President Donald Trump. He fired both of you. It appears to be illegal. Tell us how that happened. Did he call you? RS: He did not call us. I’ll start by noting that Donald Trump originally appointed me in 2018 to the FTC. I was appointed as a minority commissioner, a Democrat. The agency is, by statute, composed of bipartisan members. The statute says: five members, no more than three from any one party. I was appointed in 2018 as a minority commissioner. I served as a minority commissioner, and then I was briefly the acting chair at the beginning of the Biden administration. Then, I was a majority commissioner, along with Commissioner Bedoya, who joined us in 2022, then became a minority commissioner again in January 2025. On March 18, which was a Tuesday, I had finished a day at the office, meeting with a bunch of staff in the agency. Then, I was at my kid’s elementary school volunteering on a drama club project. We always joke that we like to keep the drama on the stage and out of our house, but no, the drama found us that day. I checked my email and I had an email from someone I’d never heard of in the Presidential Personnel Office with a message purportedly on behalf of Donald Trump announcing that I was terminated effective immediately. I stood up and I walked out of drama club to the courtyard, and I called Alvaro and I said, “Hey, have you checked your email?” And you can take the story over from there. AB: I was very proudly not checking my email because I’d just arrived at my daughter’s gymnastics class, and she gets really annoyed when she does a cool trick and I’m looking at my phone like an idiot. So, I got a call and I picked it up and Becca said, “Have you seen your email?” And I said, “Actually, I haven’t seen my email.” And she said, “You should check your email because I just got an email purporting to fire me.” Sure enough, that same email was in my inbox right there. Okay, I have a number of tech reporter questions. Did you receive a plain text email saying you had been terminated? I’m just imagining Donald Trump creating a PDF. That’s in my head. RS: No, that did not happen. There was no PDF, there was no signed letter, there was no signature. It was a text email. AB: There was no indication that there was any additional level of security associated with email. I’m just curious about the mechanics of how these decisions are made. RS: It literally felt like somebody typed an email in their Outlook and hit send. Very good, very on-brand. You guys are both in litigation against the Trump administration and Chairman Andrew Ferguson. They are in what appears to be a violation of a 90-year-old Supreme Court case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. I don’t think a district court is going to overturn that precedent. Are you prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court on this one? RS: Absolutely. This is not a complicated case. There’s no dispute about the facts and there’s no dispute about what the law says. The law says, very explicitly, that commissioners can only be removed for neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency, so what we generally call cause. You’ve got to do something wrong. The email purporting to fire us did not allege any cause, and I feel like it’s important to say that there is no cause. Neither of us have engaged in neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency. Alvaro is one of the hardest working people in not just Washington but the country, andI try to follow close behind him. There is no cause. The statute says we can only be removed for cause. That statute was passed 111 years ago and 92 years ago was the last time a president tried to remove an FTC commissioner. FDR tried to fire Commissioner William Humphrey also for no cause. He sued, challenging his removal, and then he died before the case was settled, which is why this famous case is called “Humphrey’s Executor.” His estate pursued the lawsuit, and it went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The unanimous Supreme Court said, “Yes, that statute says commissioners can only be removed for cause. And yes, that statute is constitutional.” That precedent has been undisturbed, unchanged, unchallenged… well, it’s been challenged but not effectively for 90 years. So yes, I would be shocked if a district court judge decided to unilaterally overturn 90 years of Supreme Court precedent. And yes, I think we are very prepared for this to be a case that is litigated up to the Supreme Court. Indeed, I think that’s what the administration is trying to do. They are unsubtly trying to challenge this 90-year-old precedent under the theory that the president should be able to fire whomever he wants. They argue that that is necessary for Democratic accountability. I find that argument a little ironic because I think what bipartisan commissions provide is accountability and transparency, even while allowing the president to execute his agenda by naming the chair and having the majority of the commission. There are lots of legal nuances, but it’s not a close case. There is the unitary executive theory. In many ways, the Supreme Court has pursued that theory over the course of all of their individual careers. It does feel like maybe they want to overturn another precedent. They’re on a spree of overturning, although I’m not sure I learned anything in law school. RS: Nothing we learned in law school remains relevant. It’s a fair point. Right. It’s gone. What is a tort? Let’s find out. It’s a real situation. Do you think you have a good chance with this court? AB: I think we do. RS: There’s more nuance there. AB: I think it is very important for people to realize that in a sense, this is about Commissioner Slaughter and I, and our continued service on the commission. In another arguably much more important sense, it is about a commission being able to serve without fear of favor, especially independent institutions like our own. And if the president can remove Commissioner Slaughter and I for no reason at any time, he can do the same to Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve. He can do the same for commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has done the same at the National Credit Union Administration. He could do the same at the FDIC. These are bedrock institutions of our financial life. So this is about privacy to a degree and about cybersecurity. But this is also about your retirement account, your checking account. Will those things that you hold quite dear be subject to the same stable regulatory and enforcement environment that is provided in a world where the leaders of these institutions are protected by for-cause removal productions? RS: I think it goes even further than that because these institutions also include the FCC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and a whole panoply of institutions that have been built up over the last 100 years by Congress explicitly to be bipartisan. If they effectively challenge removal protections, then what meaning do the appointment requirements have? Then, can these institutions even continue to exist because they would be so divorced from what Congress designed and built. I think understanding that the stability point that Commissioner Bedoya is talking about goes beyond if you’re going to have wild swings in policy at these agencies from administration to administration. It goes much deeper into whether these agencies can even exist. Can markets rely on the stability that they provide?” Are you taking anything from the chaos around Trump threatening Powell and walking it back as the market reacted? RS: What we are seeing is exactly what we’ve been saying, which is that he thinks he can fire whomever he wants. That he chooses not to doesn’t create stability. We are still in the same position of instability and uncertainty with these wild fluctuations that markets have been reacting to. I guess it’s good that he’s responding to market panic, but I would prefer not to panic the markets by following the laws that Congress passed and what our Constitutions says. There’s another piece of this, which is that the FTC continues to operate. It’s in court right now against Meta, and it filed a case against Uber. Chair Ferguson told our reporter Lauren Feiner at a conference that he has to “obey lawful orders,” and that he will pull those cases if the president asks him. But he would be surprised if the president asked him to stop prosecuting Meta or anyone else. Do you think that’s a viable position? Is he saying what he has to say? Is he managing Donald Trump? Is that what he really believes? AB: Let’s add a little meat to that bone, okay? Let’s just add some words to what you described. You have the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission say, “I think this trial is important. I think we are in the right in suing Meta. I think the law is on our side.” He said early on in his tenure, to his great credit, “I want to keep on going with this lawsuit.” You have a law enforcement official making that statement. You also have a law enforcement official saying at the same time, “But if the president gives me an order to drop that lawsuit, I shall do so.” Who is being served by that world? Is competition being served by that world? Are startups being served by that world? Who is helped by that scenario? The other thing that’s very important to underscore is that just because he has not been fired does not mean he is not being influenced. Just because the people haven’t been fired doesn’t mean that they haven’t changed their behavior as a result of a very clear commandment: if you obey, you will stay, and if you don’t, you won’t. Every single person serving in government will tell you that that’s what’s happening right now. So for me, I look at that and I don’t see law enforcement or the mission of the Federal Trade Commission being served by that in the slightest. It is notable that Mark Zuckerberg paid a bunch of money to build a library. He was on stage at the inauguration. He was in the Oval Office in the run-up to the Meta trial. But then he was on the stand giving testimony, and [Instagram co-founder] Kevin Systrom was on the stand. Why do you think that happened? Was is just not effective? Do you think Trump doesn’t like the bling? AB: Look… wait Trump what? He doesn’t like the bling. RS: He likes the bling. Trump is more of a classic necktie guy and [Zuckerberg has shown up with Caesar shirts. AB: I shall not speculate on that point. Let’s just talk about the meeting. In any recent Republican or Democratic administration, a megadonor visiting not just the White House but the Oval Office to meet with the president after having donated $1 dollars to the inauguration to ask for a law enforcement action to be dropped against them would be front-page news for days. It would be considered wildly inappropriate, and it would be considered antithetical to the mission that the commission was charged with doing. I don’t really care what happens after that. The simple fact of that meeting being observed and noted by everyone serving in these positions of leadership– RS: I’m going to put it a little bit more bluntly. AB: Please. RS: Bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Bribery is a problem even if it isn’t effective. We have a system of laws based on the idea that you prevail if the facts and the law are on your side and not because you tried to bribe anyone in the system. If we do not resist even efforts at bribery with every fiber of our being, we are doing an enormous disservice to the rule of law, administration of justice, and the operation of our democracy. I mean, genuinely and fundamentally, I think it’s that serious. So bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Let me push on that just a little bit. Do all these guys just suck at bribery? Because they’re all in there. The Meta case is going, Google is losing its cases. AB: Let’s talk about another gentleman who was on the stage at the inauguration, Mr. Bezos. Mr. Bezos gave $1 million dollars to the inaugural fund. His company cut a deal that would benefit the first lady to the tune of $29 million, according to the New York Post. His company separately licensed the rights to The Apprentice, which as you might imagine didn’t cost a small amount. Subsequent to most of these things, the new [Occupational Safety and Health Administration nominee] in the United States was a former Amazon executive. This is a company that has, according to numerous studies, an injury rate two times higher vis-à-vis other large warehouses. This is a company that has so many injuries on the warehouse floor that the vending machines there dispense painkillers. This is a company that, according to a Senate investigation, was denying outside referrals to medical care of its own warehouse employees for up to 21 days allegedly as a matter of policy. After you flow in a minimum of $30 million-plus dollars into those coffers, I think having the nation’s leading workplace safety law enforcer be a former executive of your company is astounding. So, I don’t know if these donations are not working, necessarily. RS: I also think that if bribery doesn’t work, the reason is because the bribee says, “No thanks. I don’t do bribes.” If they say, “Cool, give me your dollars,” and then you don’t get what you want, your message is to give more dollars, right? That’s what I think we expect to see. To Commissioner Bedoya’s point, Amazon is also in not one but two active litigations with the FTC right now and is under order for a number of other things. In one of those cases, we saw an FTC attorney go into court and say, “Because of the DOGE cuts and resource constraints, we’re going to have to delay this trial.” Now, Chair Ferguson had him walk that back very quickly, but nothing that attorney said in that courtroom was wrong, right? It was all true in terms of the resource constraints that the agency is facing and the effect that has on active cases and investigations. Is it direct influence? I don’t know. I am not in the minds of the influencers here, but I think it’s all stuff that should make us pay very close attention and be very concerned. Let me ask about the Amazon case specifically. I think of the Amazon case, and I instinctively think of Lina Khan. She came to prominence writing “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” She became the chair of the FTC. She was a flash rod of controversy. Ferguson got his job by insisting that he would throw out all of her ideas. He hasn’t though, right? He’s kept the merger guidelines, and he’s stayed in litigation against these companies. The Amazon case is the hard one. That’s the one where we might actually litigate the consumer welfare standard and, win or lose, change that precedent. Do you think that one is at the most risk or is it the Meta case? Because I associate the Amazon litigation with Chair Khan so directly that it feels like it would be the first one to go. RS: It’s hard for us to know what’s at the most risk. I see big, flashing, red danger signs all over the agency’s agenda right now. I think that case is important. Chair Khan wrote a piece, a very influential piece, about Amazon, but that is not what that case ended up being about. I actually really think everybody should read that case because what that case says — Commissioner Bedoya and I both supported that case, and I think we’re very proud to do so — was that you might associate Amazon with lower prices in your mind. But actually, the evidence shows that its conduct was raising prices not only on its own platform but across the internet, hurting not only consumers but also the sellers. So, it was exercising monopoly power in both directions. I think it reads much more like a traditional antitrust case than many people might have expected it to. We’ll see what happens in litigation if it gets to litigation and if it’s properly resourced. It’s very, very hard to know what’s actually happening behind the scenes if you’re not on the case team. So we’ll see. What everybody should want is the confidence that the law is being administered without fear or favor and not with thoughts about whose donors are going to be mad or when the phone might ring and ask you to totally change direction. That’s just bad. You can think the FTC is right or that the FTC is wrong, but you should want that case to be litigated on the merits. Period. Full stop. AB: Let me also speak to something else you said Nilay. I say this to someone who’s lived in D.C. for I think 17 years or 16 years. I think Chair Kahn was controversial in Aspen, Davos, and Sun Valley. You go and talk to a rural grocer in Utah. You go and talk to the urban grocer in North Tulsa. You go talk to corn growers and cattlemen in Iowa about the work she led and that we worked with her on. It is the opposite of controversial. The response you get is, “What took you guys so long? Thank god. Where have you been all this time? I’m so glad you’re doing this.” I get the same news sources. I’m not saying it’s coming from The Verge, but you get rained on by all this press that is focused on the stock market and Wall Street, saying all sorts of things. Half my family lives in Louisiana now. You go talk to them about the work we did. It’s a whole lot of nodding and a whole lot of support. So, I think there’s a certain picture of Chair Khan that’s been painted that’s true in very specific circles of this country. That’s the first thing. Let’s talk about that Amazon case and what it’s about because I think some of the details get lost in this big title, “Amazon.” This is what we allege in that complaint. Number one, we alleged Amazon is a monopolist in that online retail market. We allege it has so much market power that if you’re a small retailer or a small seller, you need to be on Amazon. So once it has you, we allege it slowly started jacking up the price of selling your goods on Amazon, so much so that eventually, almost 50 cents of every dollar you made on that site had to go to Amazon. So what happens? Find me a small seller who can afford to have a 50 percent haircut on every dollar they sell. So people start saying, “Oh wait, I can sell for lower off the site and make a bigger margin because I’m not taking a 50 percent haircut on every sale I make on that site.” So, we allege that when those small sellers moved off the site to sell for 10, 20, 30 percent less, that Amazon used a surveillance system to find those people who were [whispers] lowering their prices and penalize them by knocking them out of the preferred placement on the platform. You say, “It turned the consumer welfare standard on its head.” I think consumers are hurt by this, and that is emphatically part of the argument that’s being made here. I also think small sellers are hurt by this, but this is something that hurt people who wanted to pay less, and it was hurting the small retailers as well. All right, I promise not to do another 20 minutes on hipster antitrust in this room. I can do it. AB: No, no, no, we’re ready for it. Let’s talk about Meta, which is indeed on the cutting edge of privacy in exciting ways. It’s at trial right now. That case was filed in 2020 under the first Trump administration. It was dismissed in 2021 under Biden and refiled. It’s back now. The heart of that case, to me, is an extraordinarily complicated market definition: personal networking services. There’s no one in that category except Snap and a thing called MeWe. How did we get there? It feels like what Meta is really keying on is being nonsensical. RS: You’re doing hipster antitrust again. We’re back in it. Look at me. RS: Look, all antitrust cases are about market definition to a degree, and it’s a very tortured thing that makes people hate lawyers, honestly. The concept of antitrust law is very simple. The administration of it gets very complicated. So yes, most antitrust cases are about market definition, and market definition is always hard. Everybody has a different view about what the right way to define a market is that gets litigated. What that case is really about is whether Meta bought competitors to eliminate the risk of competition. That’s the argument at the end of the day. Did it not want to compete on its merits but instead take out potential competition through acquisition in order to build and maintain a monopoly in a way that’s illegal? That’s what’s going to get litigated. But it’s not a lot more complicated than that, even if there’s going to be hours of debate around what an appropriate market definition is. The reason I ask about that in this context is because Kevin Systrom is on the stand right now just dunking all over his acquirer. By the way, if all of us can have the confidence to sell our companies for a billion dollars, show up seven years later and say, “That sucked,” that’d be great for all of our self-esteem. It’s clear he didn’t like it. He’s saying very loudly they wanted to smother Instagram. That’s how he felt when he was running Instagram as part of Meta. But it still feels like Instagram got huge anyway and had Instagram been a separate company, I’m not sure it would’ve competed on a better privacy policy, or less personalized advertising. Kevin Systrom showing up on SuperLive being like, “I’m not listening to you,” does not feel like a likely outcome of Instagram being an independent company. I’m wondering, as you think about this landscape and all of the problems with consumer protection, what competition solves there and what do you need a regulatory regime to actually solve? RS: That’s a really good question. I think the point that you’re making about what the counterfactual looks like is the hard question anti-trust agencies grapple with every time they’re faced with a merger. Every time you have to review a merger, the question is, “What happens if this company gets acquired and what happens if it doesn’t?” You have to make predictions about what will happen in the market, and that’s hard. That’s a hard thing to do. That’s okay, we can do hard things. I think that the counterfactual is hard to do here. That’s true everywhere, and it’s just impossible to know, honestly. So the question is, “Did [Meta] do the acquisition to eliminate this risk of competition?” more than what the counterfactual universe of [an independent] Instagram looks like. The question that you asked about why this matters for privacy and why it matters for consumer protection is a really, really important one. Not for nothing, but Meta is also under order with the FTC for privacy violations, a renewed order that was issued in 2019 — from which I dissented — for which it paid $5 billion, and it’s currently in an administrative proceeding at the FTC over whether or not that order should be modified because there are further questions about privacy practices, including ones involving children. One of the reasons competition matters, and one of the reasons I think you see so many consumer protection cases against companies where we also have competition concerns, is because without meaningful competition and the ability for customers to vote with their feet and take their business to companies with better products that are less violative, you have an incentive to commit these violations, including to build market share. I’ll go back to an Amazon example. One of the orders that Amazon is under with the FTC right now involves Amazon Alexa devices’ illegal collection and retention of children’s voice recording info. Why did it do this collection of children’s voice data? It was in order to train its AI. So that’s, to me, a very clear example of a consumer protection violation that was orchestrated to build market share and market power. Going back to why you should care about us or our jobs — I mean, maybe you don’t care about our jobs — and why you should care about the institution existing is because it does have this cross-jurisdictional lens where it can look at competition and consumer protection. I will say, we haven’t done that very well historically. I think we have really treated these issues as siloed, but over the time I’ve been at the agency, we’ve been working really hard to integrate those functions better and understand the actual market dynamics that are leading to the kinds of problems we’re seeing both in competition and consumer protection. Let me push that again. If this case is successful and the government succeeds in spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp, do you think there’ll be a meaningful benefit to how consumers experience privacy on these platforms? RS: One would hope. One of the things that’s very frustrating about antitrust law is that ex-post enforcement is long, slow, and takes forever, and it’s very difficult to fix problems once they’ve started. One of the important purposes of bringing these cases is to prevent the next round of problems and to send clear signals to the market about the kinds of transactions that are illegal and should not happen to begin with. Yes, I would love to see healthy thriving competition with social media platforms, but I would also like to see that competition continue with new entrants, new innovation, and organic growth that isn’t just orchestrated through acquisition. Do you think anything short of a breakup would be effective there? Like a long compliance regime? RS: I’ve been talking a lot. You talk. AB: No, I think you are most familiar with the case having voted it out. We’re answering a lot of questions about a case that right now is in trial, and so I don’t feel particularly eager to expound even more on it myself. You know what you’re talking about, so you should. RS: I’ll talk generally about remedies. Everybody talks about what we call “structural remedies,” breakups as this radical approach. I find that very confusing. I actually think structural remedies are a much more small-c conservative approach because they keep the government out of the business and have the businesses operating independently. My impression over the time I’ve been at the FTC has been that complicated compliance regimes are very difficult to administer, less likely to be effective, and can, in fact, interfere with the free market operation of companies. That’s a weird thing for a Democrat to say, right? I generally like government. I think it can and should be a force for good. But I do think that administrability is a real concern in what we call “behavioral remedies.” Going back to the privacy focus, we’ve seen a lot of that concern in privacy remedies where we have complicated compliance regimes. Figuring out if they’re actually working and fixing the problem is not always that easy or clear. I want to ask one more question about privacy as a general concept and then I want to end with some AI questions. There are a lot of reasons to feel nihilism in 2025 in America. One that I get from our audience at The Verge all the time is that privacy is just lost, that it’s over. Everyone is listening to us all the time. The data has been scraped, it’s gone. Apple should just give in and make a better AI system by scraping everyone’s data, and that it won’t do it is holding it back. You can’t put this genie back in the bottle. I hear this from our audience all the time. Then, I see things that I find very amusing in a dark way, like everybody on Instagram posting a screenshot saying, “I command Mark Zuckerberg to not take my data” like an incantation, and it’s great. I look at that as the clearest market signal anyone can ever get. Everyone on my platform says, “I hate you,” but they can’t go anywhere and the terms of service do not change. They do not get renegotiated in the face of that. That is where the regulator should come in and say, “Everyone wants you to change your terms of service.” Do you think it’s just litigation that gets this done? Do you think that there is an ability through regulation to put this genie back in a bottle? RS: I have said for a long time that Congress should pass a more specific privacy law. My own views about the contours of that law and what it should look like have evolved. When Congress started talking about it looked a little bit more like a notice and consent regime, and we all think that’s a terrible idea. We do not need more cookie banners. I think a minimization-focused regulatory approach would make a lot more sense. In fact, Congress got pretty close last year. Commissioner Bedoya and I both worked on the Hill. My experience of the legislative process is that it is absolutely torturous and everything is impossible until it’s a law. It’s never going to happen, and then it’s a law. So that fight needs to continue. I think the best evidence that people actually really do care about privacy comes from the data out of Apple’s “ask not to track” system. I can’t remember what the numbers are, but the number of people who, when given the option to track or not to track, choose, “Please ask the app not to track” is overwhelming. That is a clear market signal that people actually would prefer, given the option, not to have their data shared. Where the trade-offs come up in that, like if they’re willing to get a free service in exchange for sharing data, are personal and complicated. But as a general approach, even though I think people sometimes feel like it’s a lost cause, they don’t want it to be. We have agency and we can work to change that process. AB: I agree with everything Becca just said. I would add these thoughts. The first is that we haven’t lived in a world in recent memory where people have experienced what it’s like to have a meaningful online life with privacy. We’ve lived in a world where you’ve got a bucket with nine holes in it and a bucket with 10 holes, and both of those buckets suck. No one wants a leaky bucket, and so it’s hard to get excited about the bucket with nine holes in it as opposed to the one with 10 holes. I don’t think we’ve really lived in a world where we can say that people don’t care because I don’t think they’ve ever experienced it. That said, I would point to two things that show me that people are changing their behaviors in response to what they perceive as the threat to their privacy. First of all, I have no idea how old you are, Nilay, but I know that Commissioner Slaughter and I are roughly the same age. You remember when we were in law school? The stuff people would put on Facebook was crazy. People would put everything up there. Now, you go up there, there’ll be one thing about politics, one post like, “Hey guys, I’m going to go for a long ride. What should I play for the kids in the back?” People are much more guarded on social media now than they were before. Secondly, look at the uptake in encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, especially in Washington, D.C. Signal is very popular here from what I’m told. AB: Quite prevalent, but it’s not just in Washington D.C. RS: And not just for war plans. AB: Exactly. You see a lot of people in business using Signal by default, and not just in areas where there might be some actual commercial espionage, so to speak. So, I do think you see very clear indications that people care about their privacy even though they’re living in that world of leaky buckets. RS: I’m being a little flippant and making jokes, but I think we’re also in a moment where privacy has very real serious implications for people’s safety, security, access to healthcare, religious worship, political activity, all of these things. We’re seeing very real, very scary consequences happening to real humans who are not able to operate with privacy, and that’s something that is going to change behavior, too. That is connected to this administration and its attitude towards data, to Elon Musk and DOGE. Do you think this administration is positioned to advocate for privacy while they are interlinking databases and using AI tools to surveil Americans? RS: No. AB: No. I guess that’s the answer. I was hoping that you both would say that. RS: I can’t tell if you’re baiting us, but it’s just a no. I’m baiting but in a fun way. My friend Casey Newton has this phrase he uses called the “Splinternet.” He says the internet is going to fragment, not for technical reasons but for political and social reasons. What I see is that we’re about to build a very different kind of internet in the United States that has much fewer privacy protections while Europe begins to regulate tech platforms much more strongly. It issued fines just recently against Apple and Meta. That’s the sort of thing that breaks down data sharing across our different internets, across our different platforms. How do you see that playing out? Do you think we can put that genie back in the bottle and make it possible for European governments to trust our companies? AB: Sorry, what genie again? If our government starts allowing widespread data sharing within itself and stops advocating for privacy, stops pursuing a privacy law, or lets platforms share data more openly, which it appears to be doing. AB: Let me speak very frankly here. What this administration is doing in terms of data sharing is a direct heir of everything that President Biden did, everything President Trump did in his first presidency, everything that President Obama did. In terms of law enforcement sharing information within the federal government, it has been an upwards trajectory arrow with every single administration. It is not like this administration with immigration enforcement, for example, is building a system that was previously non-existent from scratch. That is the opposite of what’s happened. These systems have been ready for many, many, years. I candidly don’t think that the data sharing that’s being discussed today is radically different from the data sharing the federal government enacted prior to this administration. There’s a lot of other areas in which I disagree, but I think we need to be fair about this and the trajectory that intra-US data sharing has taken in recent years. RS: I’ll push back on that a little bit because I think there is a substantial difference. At least in the previous administrations, there was support for independent oversight of some of that data use and sharing, such as the existence of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) and the checks on national security surveillance. That independent oversight, including at the FTC, has been part of what supported adequacy decisions in Europe and the ability of US companies to process the data of Europeans. I do think we’re headed into a direction where that is going to be challenged, and it’s hard for me to see how those challenges are not effective. Who suffers when that happens? Who suffers if we have a different European internet? Humans, people who want to use the internet and communicate with each other suffer. That’s a problem. But also American businesses suffer. When I was working on the Hill, the biggest lobbying that we got over what was then the umbrella agreement was from US companies who wanted to be able to do business in Europe. Sure, the threats to cut off US companies from European market access will penalize Europeans, but it will really penalize US business. That is a profitable market for them, and that’s going to be a problem that I expect they will not be quiet about. I think we’re headed in that direction. Fundamentally, there’s a big difference because privacy is a legal value in Europe in a way that it is not in the US. It’s not enshrined in the same way in our Constitution here. There’s always been this differential view. How it plays out in practice is going to be the subject of a lot of debate, discussion, parliamentary debate and discussion, litigation debate and discussion, and I don’t think it’s going to get resolved anytime soon. One or two more questions about AI. AI companies make a lot of promises. They’re building digital god, they will replace your doctor– AB: Sorry, did you say digital what? Digital god. AB: Digital god. Got it. It’s just a phrase that I get to hear in my job. Totally normal. AB: That’s awesome. I run a magazine about cell phones. Super normal thing for me to hear all the time. An AI executive literally told me last night there would not be doctors and lawyers in the future because AI could just do it. This is the claim level that I hear on the regular from these companies. I don’t think they can do it. Maybe they can, maybe they can’t. It seems like they’re going to make a lot of people a lot of promises about the efficacy of their products. How would you address that in the trade context? AB: Let me address it in the regular human context. That is idiocy, the idea that there will be no doctors in the future. How long have we had printers? Forty years? How well does your printer work? You’re going to let an AI doctor diagnose you for life or death matters, let alone a wart? I think this idea is inane and should not be treated with any degree of respect. I have been shocked by some of the things that these AI execs get away with saying. Someone who runs a company that is valued at something like half a trillion dollars should not be able to say that sentience will be an emergent property in the near future. That is something that anyone who’s familiar with the technology does not think is a serious take unless there are other things going on. Have you ever been to a chili cook-off and a guy arrives like, “I don’t know what’s going to happen here! Could get pretty crazy with my chili!” These claims are what lawyers would call puffery and need to be treated as such. RS: It’s also nothing new, right? For a century, the work of the Federal Trade Commission has been to police misleading claims about what products can do. We do it with so-called medicinal products, dietary supplements, and technology products. This is not new. One of the things that Commissioner Bedoya, Chair Khan, and I have been saying for years now is there is no AI exception to the law. It doesn’t create special rules for AI. We apply the same rules, which are that you can’t misrepresent what your product can do. You can’t lie about it and can’t commit deceptive or unfair acts or practices. That’s true with AI products, too. Out of the body of work that the FTC has brought around AI in the last several years, some of it has been with an eye towards competition so that there is healthy competition in this, I think, incredibly important and valuable technological tool that is not the same as replacing doctors. But a lot of it has also been about misleading claims, business opportunity scams, people saying they’re get-rich-quick schemes, and it’s all the same sort of thing we’ve seen with every other technological iteration over the last 100 years. I think it’s important to take a step back and see through what is new, interesting, different, innovative, or a valuable tool, and what is just the same stuff we’ve been seeing for decades. I would say very few people thought their laser printer was alive, which is a meaningful difference that comes up over and over again. AB: The point is how well does your printer work? Does your printer work awesome? I write a printer recommendation every year. I’ll send you some. AB: Please, please. This is a real thing. AB: Raise your hand if your printer works awesome. This guy right here. AB: Yeah, thank you. One hand, two hands. I’m not going to endorse products. AB: Seriously raise your hand if your printer is awesome. Two hands. What’s that? What printer?Yeah, see? He knows. AB: Brother laser printer. Take the recommendation otherwise because the other 98% of the room does not think their printer is awesome. There’s affiliate links on theverge.com. The promo code is printer. RS: I think your point is that generative AI is messing with people’s brains because it looks human and it’s not human. Are we confused about how to deal with this technology? That is very true. Understanding how to relate to technology and how to process what’s real and not real is a challenge for people. I remember when AirPods first came out, and you’d see people walking down the street talking to themselves, and everyone would be like, “What is happening? This is a very weird social scene.” They did not understand. Then, we became accustomed to it and learned how to interact with it. I remember when smartwatches came out, and all of a sudden you’d have people in meetings checking their watches constantly. I remember the first time it happened to me, and I was like, “Am I so boring? Are they just counting the seconds until they can get out of this meeting?” I realized that they were getting messages and just peeking down. It’s just a different evolution. I do think there’s some of that, and this is a particular push for people. I think we need to be extra sensitive and careful about what it means for children, where we think about if judgment is available to do some of that social processing. I’ll go back to a really important case that the FTC publicly announced. It was referring to the Department of Justice in January against Snap. We didn’t make the complaint public, but we made the referral public and the general series of allegations involving the way Snap’s AI chatbot interacted with children. Now, Chair Ferguson wrote a very long and public dissent when he was a commissioner that was basically about the First Amendment rights of chatbots. That was weird to me and concerning. That’s the kind of thing we do need to have real meaningful debate and discussion about. NP: I’m being told we’re out of time. Thank you so much, commissioners. This was excellent. We’ll have to have you back in soon. RS: Great, thanks. AB: Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!

Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Today, we have something special for you: A few days ago, I hosted a panel with FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit in Washington, DC. We recorded the discussion, and we’re bringing it to you today. That’s all pretty normal Decoder stuff, you might say — except these are anything but normal circumstances. Right off the bat, you’ll hear me even struggle to introduce them. Becca and Alvaro were FTC commissioners until very recently, when President Donald Trump fired them. The thing is, he doesn’t appear to have any legal authority to actually do that. As you’ll hear them discuss, by law the FTC needs to have commissioners from both political parties. Additionally, there’s a 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent that explicitly says the President can’t fire FTC commissioners in this way. So, given all that, they’re suing the administration to get their jobs back — and as you’ll hear, they are both committed to taking this case all the way to the Supreme Court. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! That puts them in a deeply weird, Schrödinger’s cat kind of position, for now: they both are and are not currently working as FTC commissioners, and that creates some strange tensions you’ll hear us get into. On top of all that, of course, there’s the actual work of the FTC going on. The antitrust trial against Meta was going on basically down the street from where I sat talking with Rebecca and Alvaro, so I spent some time asking how that case was going — and why Mark Zuckerberg’s donations to the inauguration and frequent appearances in the Oval Office haven’t seemed to dissuade the government from trying to break up Meta. You’ll hear Becca in particular point out that being bad at bribes still means the government is open for bribery and corruption, and that creates all kinds of other problems for the economy. There’s a lot going on in this conversation, from how the president fires you to the attempt in Silicon Valley to build AI into a digital god. We also somehow ended up taking printer recommendations from the audience. It’s a good one. Okay: liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Hi everybody. I am Nilay Patel. I’m the editor-in-chief of The Verge and host of the Decoder podcast. I have two excellent guests with me today. I’m going to say former Federal Trade Commission chairs. Alvaro Bedoya: That’s up to you. That’s your call. We would politely disagree. Rebecca Slaughter: We would not say that. Current liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Welcome, thank you for being here. RS: Thanks for having us. I have a million questions for the both of you. Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Normally, in a conversation about privacy and consumer protection with FTC commissioners, it would be a fairly predictable set of topics, especially now with AI. It is not a predictable time in America. It is not a predictable set of circumstances. Let’s start with your status with President Donald Trump. He fired both of you. It appears to be illegal. Tell us how that happened. Did he call you? RS: He did not call us. I’ll start by noting that Donald Trump originally appointed me in 2018 to the FTC. I was appointed as a minority commissioner, a Democrat. The agency is, by statute, composed of bipartisan members. The statute says: five members, no more than three from any one party. I was appointed in 2018 as a minority commissioner. I served as a minority commissioner, and then I was briefly the acting chair at the beginning of the Biden administration. Then, I was a majority commissioner, along with Commissioner Bedoya, who joined us in 2022, then became a minority commissioner again in January 2025. On March 18, which was a Tuesday, I had finished a day at the office, meeting with a bunch of staff in the agency. Then, I was at my kid’s elementary school volunteering on a drama club project. We always joke that we like to keep the drama on the stage and out of our house, but no, the drama found us that day. I checked my email and I had an email from someone I’d never heard of in the Presidential Personnel Office with a message purportedly on behalf of Donald Trump announcing that I was terminated effective immediately. I stood up and I walked out of drama club to the courtyard, and I called Alvaro and I said, “Hey, have you checked your email?” And you can take the story over from there. AB: I was very proudly not checking my email because I’d just arrived at my daughter’s gymnastics class, and she gets really annoyed when she does a cool trick and I’m looking at my phone like an idiot. So, I got a call and I picked it up and Becca said, “Have you seen your email?” And I said, “Actually, I haven’t seen my email.” And she said, “You should check your email because I just got an email purporting to fire me.” Sure enough, that same email was in my inbox right there. Okay, I have a number of tech reporter questions. Did you receive a plain text email saying you had been terminated? I’m just imagining Donald Trump creating a PDF. That’s in my head. RS: No, that did not happen. There was no PDF, there was no signed letter, there was no signature. It was a text email. AB: There was no indication that there was any additional level of security associated with email. I’m just curious about the mechanics of how these decisions are made. RS: It literally felt like somebody typed an email in their Outlook and hit send. Very good, very on-brand. You guys are both in litigation against the Trump administration and Chairman Andrew Ferguson. They are in what appears to be a violation of a 90-year-old Supreme Court case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. I don’t think a district court is going to overturn that precedent. Are you prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court on this one? RS: Absolutely. This is not a complicated case. There’s no dispute about the facts and there’s no dispute about what the law says. The law says, very explicitly, that commissioners can only be removed for neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency, so what we generally call cause. You’ve got to do something wrong. The email purporting to fire us did not allege any cause, and I feel like it’s important to say that there is no cause. Neither of us have engaged in neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency. Alvaro is one of the hardest working people in not just Washington but the country, andI try to follow close behind him. There is no cause. The statute says we can only be removed for cause. That statute was passed 111 years ago and 92 years ago was the last time a president tried to remove an FTC commissioner. FDR tried to fire Commissioner William Humphrey also for no cause. He sued, challenging his removal, and then he died before the case was settled, which is why this famous case is called “Humphrey’s Executor.” His estate pursued the lawsuit, and it went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The unanimous Supreme Court said, “Yes, that statute says commissioners can only be removed for cause. And yes, that statute is constitutional.” That precedent has been undisturbed, unchanged, unchallenged… well, it’s been challenged but not effectively for 90 years. So yes, I would be shocked if a district court judge decided to unilaterally overturn 90 years of Supreme Court precedent. And yes, I think we are very prepared for this to be a case that is litigated up to the Supreme Court. Indeed, I think that’s what the administration is trying to do. They are unsubtly trying to challenge this 90-year-old precedent under the theory that the president should be able to fire whomever he wants. They argue that that is necessary for Democratic accountability. I find that argument a little ironic because I think what bipartisan commissions provide is accountability and transparency, even while allowing the president to execute his agenda by naming the chair and having the majority of the commission. There are lots of legal nuances, but it’s not a close case. There is the unitary executive theory. In many ways, the Supreme Court has pursued that theory over the course of all of their individual careers. It does feel like maybe they want to overturn another precedent. They’re on a spree of overturning, although I’m not sure I learned anything in law school. RS: Nothing we learned in law school remains relevant. It’s a fair point. Right. It’s gone. What is a tort? Let’s find out. It’s a real situation. Do you think you have a good chance with this court? AB: I think we do. RS: There’s more nuance there. AB: I think it is very important for people to realize that in a sense, this is about Commissioner Slaughter and I, and our continued service on the commission. In another arguably much more important sense, it is about a commission being able to serve without fear of favor, especially independent institutions like our own. And if the president can remove Commissioner Slaughter and I for no reason at any time, he can do the same to Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve. He can do the same for commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has done the same at the National Credit Union Administration. He could do the same at the FDIC. These are bedrock institutions of our financial life. So this is about privacy to a degree and about cybersecurity. But this is also about your retirement account, your checking account. Will those things that you hold quite dear be subject to the same stable regulatory and enforcement environment that is provided in a world where the leaders of these institutions are protected by for-cause removal productions? RS: I think it goes even further than that because these institutions also include the FCC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and a whole panoply of institutions that have been built up over the last 100 years by Congress explicitly to be bipartisan. If they effectively challenge removal protections, then what meaning do the appointment requirements have? Then, can these institutions even continue to exist because they would be so divorced from what Congress designed and built. I think understanding that the stability point that Commissioner Bedoya is talking about goes beyond if you’re going to have wild swings in policy at these agencies from administration to administration. It goes much deeper into whether these agencies can even exist. Can markets rely on the stability that they provide?” Are you taking anything from the chaos around Trump threatening Powell and walking it back as the market reacted? RS: What we are seeing is exactly what we’ve been saying, which is that he thinks he can fire whomever he wants. That he chooses not to doesn’t create stability. We are still in the same position of instability and uncertainty with these wild fluctuations that markets have been reacting to. I guess it’s good that he’s responding to market panic, but I would prefer not to panic the markets by following the laws that Congress passed and what our Constitutions says. There’s another piece of this, which is that the FTC continues to operate. It’s in court right now against Meta, and it filed a case against Uber. Chair Ferguson told our reporter Lauren Feiner at a conference that he has to “obey lawful orders,” and that he will pull those cases if the president asks him. But he would be surprised if the president asked him to stop prosecuting Meta or anyone else. Do you think that’s a viable position? Is he saying what he has to say? Is he managing Donald Trump? Is that what he really believes? AB: Let’s add a little meat to that bone, okay? Let’s just add some words to what you described. You have the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission say, “I think this trial is important. I think we are in the right in suing Meta. I think the law is on our side.” He said early on in his tenure, to his great credit, “I want to keep on going with this lawsuit.” You have a law enforcement official making that statement. You also have a law enforcement official saying at the same time, “But if the president gives me an order to drop that lawsuit, I shall do so.” Who is being served by that world? Is competition being served by that world? Are startups being served by that world? Who is helped by that scenario? The other thing that’s very important to underscore is that just because he has not been fired does not mean he is not being influenced. Just because the people haven’t been fired doesn’t mean that they haven’t changed their behavior as a result of a very clear commandment: if you obey, you will stay, and if you don’t, you won’t. Every single person serving in government will tell you that that’s what’s happening right now. So for me, I look at that and I don’t see law enforcement or the mission of the Federal Trade Commission being served by that in the slightest. It is notable that Mark Zuckerberg paid a bunch of money to build a library. He was on stage at the inauguration. He was in the Oval Office in the run-up to the Meta trial. But then he was on the stand giving testimony, and [Instagram co-founder] Kevin Systrom was on the stand. Why do you think that happened? Was is just not effective? Do you think Trump doesn’t like the bling? AB: Look… wait Trump what? He doesn’t like the bling. RS: He likes the bling. Trump is more of a classic necktie guy and [Zuckerberg has shown up with Caesar shirts. AB: I shall not speculate on that point. Let’s just talk about the meeting. In any recent Republican or Democratic administration, a megadonor visiting not just the White House but the Oval Office to meet with the president after having donated $1 dollars to the inauguration to ask for a law enforcement action to be dropped against them would be front-page news for days. It would be considered wildly inappropriate, and it would be considered antithetical to the mission that the commission was charged with doing. I don’t really care what happens after that. The simple fact of that meeting being observed and noted by everyone serving in these positions of leadership– RS: I’m going to put it a little bit more bluntly. AB: Please. RS: Bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Bribery is a problem even if it isn’t effective. We have a system of laws based on the idea that you prevail if the facts and the law are on your side and not because you tried to bribe anyone in the system. If we do not resist even efforts at bribery with every fiber of our being, we are doing an enormous disservice to the rule of law, administration of justice, and the operation of our democracy. I mean, genuinely and fundamentally, I think it’s that serious. So bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Let me push on that just a little bit. Do all these guys just suck at bribery? Because they’re all in there. The Meta case is going, Google is losing its cases. AB: Let’s talk about another gentleman who was on the stage at the inauguration, Mr. Bezos. Mr. Bezos gave $1 million dollars to the inaugural fund. His company cut a deal that would benefit the first lady to the tune of $29 million, according to the New York Post. His company separately licensed the rights to The Apprentice, which as you might imagine didn’t cost a small amount. Subsequent to most of these things, the new [Occupational Safety and Health Administration nominee] in the United States was a former Amazon executive. This is a company that has, according to numerous studies, an injury rate two times higher vis-à-vis other large warehouses. This is a company that has so many injuries on the warehouse floor that the vending machines there dispense painkillers. This is a company that, according to a Senate investigation, was denying outside referrals to medical care of its own warehouse employees for up to 21 days allegedly as a matter of policy. After you flow in a minimum of $30 million-plus dollars into those coffers, I think having the nation’s leading workplace safety law enforcer be a former executive of your company is astounding. So, I don’t know if these donations are not working, necessarily. RS: I also think that if bribery doesn’t work, the reason is because the bribee says, “No thanks. I don’t do bribes.” If they say, “Cool, give me your dollars,” and then you don’t get what you want, your message is to give more dollars, right? That’s what I think we expect to see. To Commissioner Bedoya’s point, Amazon is also in not one but two active litigations with the FTC right now and is under order for a number of other things. In one of those cases, we saw an FTC attorney go into court and say, “Because of the DOGE cuts and resource constraints, we’re going to have to delay this trial.” Now, Chair Ferguson had him walk that back very quickly, but nothing that attorney said in that courtroom was wrong, right? It was all true in terms of the resource constraints that the agency is facing and the effect that has on active cases and investigations. Is it direct influence? I don’t know. I am not in the minds of the influencers here, but I think it’s all stuff that should make us pay very close attention and be very concerned. Let me ask about the Amazon case specifically. I think of the Amazon case, and I instinctively think of Lina Khan. She came to prominence writing “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” She became the chair of the FTC. She was a flash rod of controversy. Ferguson got his job by insisting that he would throw out all of her ideas. He hasn’t though, right? He’s kept the merger guidelines, and he’s stayed in litigation against these companies. The Amazon case is the hard one. That’s the one where we might actually litigate the consumer welfare standard and, win or lose, change that precedent. Do you think that one is at the most risk or is it the Meta case? Because I associate the Amazon litigation with Chair Khan so directly that it feels like it would be the first one to go. RS: It’s hard for us to know what’s at the most risk. I see big, flashing, red danger signs all over the agency’s agenda right now. I think that case is important. Chair Khan wrote a piece, a very influential piece, about Amazon, but that is not what that case ended up being about. I actually really think everybody should read that case because what that case says — Commissioner Bedoya and I both supported that case, and I think we’re very proud to do so — was that you might associate Amazon with lower prices in your mind. But actually, the evidence shows that its conduct was raising prices not only on its own platform but across the internet, hurting not only consumers but also the sellers. So, it was exercising monopoly power in both directions. I think it reads much more like a traditional antitrust case than many people might have expected it to. We’ll see what happens in litigation if it gets to litigation and if it’s properly resourced. It’s very, very hard to know what’s actually happening behind the scenes if you’re not on the case team. So we’ll see. What everybody should want is the confidence that the law is being administered without fear or favor and not with thoughts about whose donors are going to be mad or when the phone might ring and ask you to totally change direction. That’s just bad. You can think the FTC is right or that the FTC is wrong, but you should want that case to be litigated on the merits. Period. Full stop. AB: Let me also speak to something else you said Nilay. I say this to someone who’s lived in D.C. for I think 17 years or 16 years. I think Chair Kahn was controversial in Aspen, Davos, and Sun Valley. You go and talk to a rural grocer in Utah. You go and talk to the urban grocer in North Tulsa. You go talk to corn growers and cattlemen in Iowa about the work she led and that we worked with her on. It is the opposite of controversial. The response you get is, “What took you guys so long? Thank god. Where have you been all this time? I’m so glad you’re doing this.” I get the same news sources. I’m not saying it’s coming from The Verge, but you get rained on by all this press that is focused on the stock market and Wall Street, saying all sorts of things. Half my family lives in Louisiana now. You go talk to them about the work we did. It’s a whole lot of nodding and a whole lot of support. So, I think there’s a certain picture of Chair Khan that’s been painted that’s true in very specific circles of this country. That’s the first thing. Let’s talk about that Amazon case and what it’s about because I think some of the details get lost in this big title, “Amazon.” This is what we allege in that complaint. Number one, we alleged Amazon is a monopolist in that online retail market. We allege it has so much market power that if you’re a small retailer or a small seller, you need to be on Amazon. So once it has you, we allege it slowly started jacking up the price of selling your goods on Amazon, so much so that eventually, almost 50 cents of every dollar you made on that site had to go to Amazon. So what happens? Find me a small seller who can afford to have a 50 percent haircut on every dollar they sell. So people start saying, “Oh wait, I can sell for lower off the site and make a bigger margin because I’m not taking a 50 percent haircut on every sale I make on that site.” So, we allege that when those small sellers moved off the site to sell for 10, 20, 30 percent less, that Amazon used a surveillance system to find those people who were [whispers] lowering their prices and penalize them by knocking them out of the preferred placement on the platform. You say, “It turned the consumer welfare standard on its head.” I think consumers are hurt by this, and that is emphatically part of the argument that’s being made here. I also think small sellers are hurt by this, but this is something that hurt people who wanted to pay less, and it was hurting the small retailers as well. All right, I promise not to do another 20 minutes on hipster antitrust in this room. I can do it. AB: No, no, no, we’re ready for it. Let’s talk about Meta, which is indeed on the cutting edge of privacy in exciting ways. It’s at trial right now. That case was filed in 2020 under the first Trump administration. It was dismissed in 2021 under Biden and refiled. It’s back now. The heart of that case, to me, is an extraordinarily complicated market definition: personal networking services. There’s no one in that category except Snap and a thing called MeWe. How did we get there? It feels like what Meta is really keying on is being nonsensical. RS: You’re doing hipster antitrust again. We’re back in it. Look at me. RS: Look, all antitrust cases are about market definition to a degree, and it’s a very tortured thing that makes people hate lawyers, honestly. The concept of antitrust law is very simple. The administration of it gets very complicated. So yes, most antitrust cases are about market definition, and market definition is always hard. Everybody has a different view about what the right way to define a market is that gets litigated. What that case is really about is whether Meta bought competitors to eliminate the risk of competition. That’s the argument at the end of the day. Did it not want to compete on its merits but instead take out potential competition through acquisition in order to build and maintain a monopoly in a way that’s illegal? That’s what’s going to get litigated. But it’s not a lot more complicated than that, even if there’s going to be hours of debate around what an appropriate market definition is. The reason I ask about that in this context is because Kevin Systrom is on the stand right now just dunking all over his acquirer. By the way, if all of us can have the confidence to sell our companies for a billion dollars, show up seven years later and say, “That sucked,” that’d be great for all of our self-esteem. It’s clear he didn’t like it. He’s saying very loudly they wanted to smother Instagram. That’s how he felt when he was running Instagram as part of Meta. But it still feels like Instagram got huge anyway and had Instagram been a separate company, I’m not sure it would’ve competed on a better privacy policy, or less personalized advertising. Kevin Systrom showing up on SuperLive being like, “I’m not listening to you,” does not feel like a likely outcome of Instagram being an independent company. I’m wondering, as you think about this landscape and all of the problems with consumer protection, what competition solves there and what do you need a regulatory regime to actually solve? RS: That’s a really good question. I think the point that you’re making about what the counterfactual looks like is the hard question anti-trust agencies grapple with every time they’re faced with a merger. Every time you have to review a merger, the question is, “What happens if this company gets acquired and what happens if it doesn’t?” You have to make predictions about what will happen in the market, and that’s hard. That’s a hard thing to do. That’s okay, we can do hard things. I think that the counterfactual is hard to do here. That’s true everywhere, and it’s just impossible to know, honestly. So the question is, “Did [Meta] do the acquisition to eliminate this risk of competition?” more than what the counterfactual universe of [an independent] Instagram looks like. The question that you asked about why this matters for privacy and why it matters for consumer protection is a really, really important one. Not for nothing, but Meta is also under order with the FTC for privacy violations, a renewed order that was issued in 2019 — from which I dissented — for which it paid $5 billion, and it’s currently in an administrative proceeding at the FTC over whether or not that order should be modified because there are further questions about privacy practices, including ones involving children. One of the reasons competition matters, and one of the reasons I think you see so many consumer protection cases against companies where we also have competition concerns, is because without meaningful competition and the ability for customers to vote with their feet and take their business to companies with better products that are less violative, you have an incentive to commit these violations, including to build market share. I’ll go back to an Amazon example. One of the orders that Amazon is under with the FTC right now involves Amazon Alexa devices’ illegal collection and retention of children’s voice recording info. Why did it do this collection of children’s voice data? It was in order to train its AI. So that’s, to me, a very clear example of a consumer protection violation that was orchestrated to build market share and market power. Going back to why you should care about us or our jobs — I mean, maybe you don’t care about our jobs — and why you should care about the institution existing is because it does have this cross-jurisdictional lens where it can look at competition and consumer protection. I will say, we haven’t done that very well historically. I think we have really treated these issues as siloed, but over the time I’ve been at the agency, we’ve been working really hard to integrate those functions better and understand the actual market dynamics that are leading to the kinds of problems we’re seeing both in competition and consumer protection. Let me push that again. If this case is successful and the government succeeds in spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp, do you think there’ll be a meaningful benefit to how consumers experience privacy on these platforms? RS: One would hope. One of the things that’s very frustrating about antitrust law is that ex-post enforcement is long, slow, and takes forever, and it’s very difficult to fix problems once they’ve started. One of the important purposes of bringing these cases is to prevent the next round of problems and to send clear signals to the market about the kinds of transactions that are illegal and should not happen to begin with. Yes, I would love to see healthy thriving competition with social media platforms, but I would also like to see that competition continue with new entrants, new innovation, and organic growth that isn’t just orchestrated through acquisition. Do you think anything short of a breakup would be effective there? Like a long compliance regime? RS: I’ve been talking a lot. You talk. AB: No, I think you are most familiar with the case having voted it out. We’re answering a lot of questions about a case that right now is in trial, and so I don’t feel particularly eager to expound even more on it myself. You know what you’re talking about, so you should. RS: I’ll talk generally about remedies. Everybody talks about what we call “structural remedies,” breakups as this radical approach. I find that very confusing. I actually think structural remedies are a much more small-c conservative approach because they keep the government out of the business and have the businesses operating independently. My impression over the time I’ve been at the FTC has been that complicated compliance regimes are very difficult to administer, less likely to be effective, and can, in fact, interfere with the free market operation of companies. That’s a weird thing for a Democrat to say, right? I generally like government. I think it can and should be a force for good. But I do think that administrability is a real concern in what we call “behavioral remedies.” Going back to the privacy focus, we’ve seen a lot of that concern in privacy remedies where we have complicated compliance regimes. Figuring out if they’re actually working and fixing the problem is not always that easy or clear. I want to ask one more question about privacy as a general concept and then I want to end with some AI questions. There are a lot of reasons to feel nihilism in 2025 in America. One that I get from our audience at The Verge all the time is that privacy is just lost, that it’s over. Everyone is listening to us all the time. The data has been scraped, it’s gone. Apple should just give in and make a better AI system by scraping everyone’s data, and that it won’t do it is holding it back. You can’t put this genie back in the bottle. I hear this from our audience all the time. Then, I see things that I find very amusing in a dark way, like everybody on Instagram posting a screenshot saying, “I command Mark Zuckerberg to not take my data” like an incantation, and it’s great. I look at that as the clearest market signal anyone can ever get. Everyone on my platform says, “I hate you,” but they can’t go anywhere and the terms of service do not change. They do not get renegotiated in the face of that. That is where the regulator should come in and say, “Everyone wants you to change your terms of service.” Do you think it’s just litigation that gets this done? Do you think that there is an ability through regulation to put this genie back in a bottle? RS: I have said for a long time that Congress should pass a more specific privacy law. My own views about the contours of that law and what it should look like have evolved. When Congress started talking about it looked a little bit more like a notice and consent regime, and we all think that’s a terrible idea. We do not need more cookie banners. I think a minimization-focused regulatory approach would make a lot more sense. In fact, Congress got pretty close last year. Commissioner Bedoya and I both worked on the Hill. My experience of the legislative process is that it is absolutely torturous and everything is impossible until it’s a law. It’s never going to happen, and then it’s a law. So that fight needs to continue. I think the best evidence that people actually really do care about privacy comes from the data out of Apple’s “ask not to track” system. I can’t remember what the numbers are, but the number of people who, when given the option to track or not to track, choose, “Please ask the app not to track” is overwhelming. That is a clear market signal that people actually would prefer, given the option, not to have their data shared. Where the trade-offs come up in that, like if they’re willing to get a free service in exchange for sharing data, are personal and complicated. But as a general approach, even though I think people sometimes feel like it’s a lost cause, they don’t want it to be. We have agency and we can work to change that process. AB: I agree with everything Becca just said. I would add these thoughts. The first is that we haven’t lived in a world in recent memory where people have experienced what it’s like to have a meaningful online life with privacy. We’ve lived in a world where you’ve got a bucket with nine holes in it and a bucket with 10 holes, and both of those buckets suck. No one wants a leaky bucket, and so it’s hard to get excited about the bucket with nine holes in it as opposed to the one with 10 holes. I don’t think we’ve really lived in a world where we can say that people don’t care because I don’t think they’ve ever experienced it. That said, I would point to two things that show me that people are changing their behaviors in response to what they perceive as the threat to their privacy. First of all, I have no idea how old you are, Nilay, but I know that Commissioner Slaughter and I are roughly the same age. You remember when we were in law school? The stuff people would put on Facebook was crazy. People would put everything up there. Now, you go up there, there’ll be one thing about politics, one post like, “Hey guys, I’m going to go for a long ride. What should I play for the kids in the back?” People are much more guarded on social media now than they were before. Secondly, look at the uptake in encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, especially in Washington, D.C. Signal is very popular here from what I’m told. AB: Quite prevalent, but it’s not just in Washington D.C. RS: And not just for war plans. AB: Exactly. You see a lot of people in business using Signal by default, and not just in areas where there might be some actual commercial espionage, so to speak. So, I do think you see very clear indications that people care about their privacy even though they’re living in that world of leaky buckets. RS: I’m being a little flippant and making jokes, but I think we’re also in a moment where privacy has very real serious implications for people’s safety, security, access to healthcare, religious worship, political activity, all of these things. We’re seeing very real, very scary consequences happening to real humans who are not able to operate with privacy, and that’s something that is going to change behavior, too. That is connected to this administration and its attitude towards data, to Elon Musk and DOGE. Do you think this administration is positioned to advocate for privacy while they are interlinking databases and using AI tools to surveil Americans? RS: No. AB: No. I guess that’s the answer. I was hoping that you both would say that. RS: I can’t tell if you’re baiting us, but it’s just a no. I’m baiting but in a fun way. My friend Casey Newton has this phrase he uses called the “Splinternet.” He says the internet is going to fragment, not for technical reasons but for political and social reasons. What I see is that we’re about to build a very different kind of internet in the United States that has much fewer privacy protections while Europe begins to regulate tech platforms much more strongly. It issued fines just recently against Apple and Meta. That’s the sort of thing that breaks down data sharing across our different internets, across our different platforms. How do you see that playing out? Do you think we can put that genie back in the bottle and make it possible for European governments to trust our companies? AB: Sorry, what genie again? If our government starts allowing widespread data sharing within itself and stops advocating for privacy, stops pursuing a privacy law, or lets platforms share data more openly, which it appears to be doing. AB: Let me speak very frankly here. What this administration is doing in terms of data sharing is a direct heir of everything that President Biden did, everything President Trump did in his first presidency, everything that President Obama did. In terms of law enforcement sharing information within the federal government, it has been an upwards trajectory arrow with every single administration. It is not like this administration with immigration enforcement, for example, is building a system that was previously non-existent from scratch. That is the opposite of what’s happened. These systems have been ready for many, many, years. I candidly don’t think that the data sharing that’s being discussed today is radically different from the data sharing the federal government enacted prior to this administration. There’s a lot of other areas in which I disagree, but I think we need to be fair about this and the trajectory that intra-US data sharing has taken in recent years. RS: I’ll push back on that a little bit because I think there is a substantial difference. At least in the previous administrations, there was support for independent oversight of some of that data use and sharing, such as the existence of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) and the checks on national security surveillance. That independent oversight, including at the FTC, has been part of what supported adequacy decisions in Europe and the ability of US companies to process the data of Europeans. I do think we’re headed into a direction where that is going to be challenged, and it’s hard for me to see how those challenges are not effective. Who suffers when that happens? Who suffers if we have a different European internet? Humans, people who want to use the internet and communicate with each other suffer. That’s a problem. But also American businesses suffer. When I was working on the Hill, the biggest lobbying that we got over what was then the umbrella agreement was from US companies who wanted to be able to do business in Europe. Sure, the threats to cut off US companies from European market access will penalize Europeans, but it will really penalize US business. That is a profitable market for them, and that’s going to be a problem that I expect they will not be quiet about. I think we’re headed in that direction. Fundamentally, there’s a big difference because privacy is a legal value in Europe in a way that it is not in the US. It’s not enshrined in the same way in our Constitution here. There’s always been this differential view. How it plays out in practice is going to be the subject of a lot of debate, discussion, parliamentary debate and discussion, litigation debate and discussion, and I don’t think it’s going to get resolved anytime soon. One or two more questions about AI. AI companies make a lot of promises. They’re building digital god, they will replace your doctor– AB: Sorry, did you say digital what? Digital god. AB: Digital god. Got it. It’s just a phrase that I get to hear in my job. Totally normal. AB: That’s awesome. I run a magazine about cell phones. Super normal thing for me to hear all the time. An AI executive literally told me last night there would not be doctors and lawyers in the future because AI could just do it. This is the claim level that I hear on the regular from these companies. I don’t think they can do it. Maybe they can, maybe they can’t. It seems like they’re going to make a lot of people a lot of promises about the efficacy of their products. How would you address that in the trade context? AB: Let me address it in the regular human context. That is idiocy, the idea that there will be no doctors in the future. How long have we had printers? Forty years? How well does your printer work? You’re going to let an AI doctor diagnose you for life or death matters, let alone a wart? I think this idea is inane and should not be treated with any degree of respect. I have been shocked by some of the things that these AI execs get away with saying. Someone who runs a company that is valued at something like half a trillion dollars should not be able to say that sentience will be an emergent property in the near future. That is something that anyone who’s familiar with the technology does not think is a serious take unless there are other things going on. Have you ever been to a chili cook-off and a guy arrives like, “I don’t know what’s going to happen here! Could get pretty crazy with my chili!” These claims are what lawyers would call puffery and need to be treated as such. RS: It’s also nothing new, right? For a century, the work of the Federal Trade Commission has been to police misleading claims about what products can do. We do it with so-called medicinal products, dietary supplements, and technology products. This is not new. One of the things that Commissioner Bedoya, Chair Khan, and I have been saying for years now is there is no AI exception to the law. It doesn’t create special rules for AI. We apply the same rules, which are that you can’t misrepresent what your product can do. You can’t lie about it and can’t commit deceptive or unfair acts or practices. That’s true with AI products, too. Out of the body of work that the FTC has brought around AI in the last several years, some of it has been with an eye towards competition so that there is healthy competition in this, I think, incredibly important and valuable technological tool that is not the same as replacing doctors. But a lot of it has also been about misleading claims, business opportunity scams, people saying they’re get-rich-quick schemes, and it’s all the same sort of thing we’ve seen with every other technological iteration over the last 100 years. I think it’s important to take a step back and see through what is new, interesting, different, innovative, or a valuable tool, and what is just the same stuff we’ve been seeing for decades. I would say very few people thought their laser printer was alive, which is a meaningful difference that comes up over and over again. AB: The point is how well does your printer work? Does your printer work awesome? I write a printer recommendation every year. I’ll send you some. AB: Please, please. This is a real thing. AB: Raise your hand if your printer works awesome. This guy right here. AB: Yeah, thank you. One hand, two hands. I’m not going to endorse products. AB: Seriously raise your hand if your printer is awesome. Two hands. What’s that? What printer?Yeah, see? He knows. AB: Brother laser printer. Take the recommendation otherwise because the other 98% of the room does not think their printer is awesome. There’s affiliate links on theverge.com. The promo code is printer. RS: I think your point is that generative AI is messing with people’s brains because it looks human and it’s not human. Are we confused about how to deal with this technology? That is very true. Understanding how to relate to technology and how to process what’s real and not real is a challenge for people. I remember when AirPods first came out, and you’d see people walking down the street talking to themselves, and everyone would be like, “What is happening? This is a very weird social scene.” They did not understand. Then, we became accustomed to it and learned how to interact with it. I remember when smartwatches came out, and all of a sudden you’d have people in meetings checking their watches constantly. I remember the first time it happened to me, and I was like, “Am I so boring? Are they just counting the seconds until they can get out of this meeting?” I realized that they were getting messages and just peeking down. It’s just a different evolution. I do think there’s some of that, and this is a particular push for people. I think we need to be extra sensitive and careful about what it means for children, where we think about if judgment is available to do some of that social processing. I’ll go back to a really important case that the FTC publicly announced. It was referring to the Department of Justice in January against Snap. We didn’t make the complaint public, but we made the referral public and the general series of allegations involving the way Snap’s AI chatbot interacted with children. Now, Chair Ferguson wrote a very long and public dissent when he was a commissioner that was basically about the First Amendment rights of chatbots. That was weird to me and concerning. That’s the kind of thing we do need to have real meaningful debate and discussion about. NP: I’m being told we’re out of time. Thank you so much, commissioners. This was excellent. We’ll have to have you back in soon. RS: Great, thanks. AB: Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!

Full Content:
Among various cancers, primary liver cancer is the seventh most diagnosed malignancy and is the second most prevalent contributor to cancer-causing deaths. During conventional treatment, the recurrence of disease, low drug inefficacy, and severe side effects are the main limitations. Recently, natural anticancer medicines from the Middle East, Korea, China, Europe, North America, and India have attracted a lot of interest due to their low side effects and better remedial properties. The current study investigated the antioxidative and anticancer effects of ethanolic (BME) and n-hexane (BMH) extracts of B. monnieri (L.) Wettst. In the current study, phytochemical profiling was done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The antioxidant potential was measured using DPPH, nitric oxide, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide assays, while the cell viability and apoptotic effect were measured by MTT, crystal violet, and annexin V/PI protocols, respectively. Higher concentrations of total phenolic contents (274.92±3.52 mgGAE/g), total flavonoid contents (141.99±4.14 mgQE/g) and tannins (55.49±4.63 mgTAE/g) were observed in BME extract with strong antioxidant potential than BMH extract. Also, BME extract showed higher cytotoxicity with less IC50 value (24.70 μg/mL) and a lower percentage of cell viability, while the same extract exhibited 58.65% apoptosis against HepG2 cells in comparison to cisplatin and BMH extract. Furthermore, Spiro[(tricyclo[6.2.2.0(2,7)]dodeca-5,9-diene)-4,1’-cyclobutane]-11,2’-dione from BME extract showed the lead docking score of -8.8, -8.1 and -7.8 kcal/mol against TGF-βR1, TNF-α, and iNOS, respectively. In conclusion, the ethanolic extract of B. monnieri has a significant potential for becoming a potent anticancer drug that effectively treats liver damage, including HCC.

According to the recent estimates, 830,200 deaths and 905700 cases of liver cancer were observed in 2020. The American Cancer Society estimated that diagnosis of 41,210 cases (27,980 in men and 13,230 in women) and 29,380 fatalities (10,380 cases in females and 19,000 in males) found in 2023 [2]. It is also estimated that 1.4 million expected cases with 1.3 million mortalities will be expected in 2040 [3]. The most prevalent forms of primary liver cancer include hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), followed by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (10–15%) and other liver malignancies [4]. Almost ninety percent of HCCs have recognized underlying etiologies, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, severe alcoholism, and chronic viral hepatitis [5]. Prolonged inflammation, oxidative stress, tissue remodeling, genetic changes, and deregulated cellular signaling are thought to be the important mechanisms involved in HCC development and progression [6]. Recently, the primary treatment options for HCC include surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, local ablation therapy, and liver transplantation. These conventional therapies are efficient at early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma but are ineffective at advanced stages due to the development of serious adverse effects such as metastasis, frequent recurrence, drug resistance, and many others [7]. Thus, substantial research is required to discover and develop novel anticancer drugs considering the increasing risk of drug-resistant malignancies with fewer side effects [8]. In the past few decades, considerable attention has been given to medicinal plants and herbal extracts containing valuable phytoconstituents with structural diversity and novel therapeutics to inhibit or destroy cancerous cells by overcoming drug resistance during cancer treatment [9]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than eighty percent of the global population opts for these traditional medicinal plant-based treatment options [10]. Medicinal plants possess a wide range of bioactive compounds such as catechins, polyphenols, flavonoids, triterpenoids, alkaloids, glycosides, and a plethora of others, which may reduce cell proliferation due to their anti-angiogenic, anti-mutagenic, antioxidant and anti-cancer properties [11]. Moreover, plant-derived phytocompounds offer better safety and efficacy because of their distinct molecular characteristics and diverse structure [12]. In medicinal plants, GC-MS analysis is an indispensable technique for identifying therapeutically important compounds [13]. In this context, molecular docking is an economical and efficient method for testing and developing natural medicines. This method provides information on the interaction between natural ligands and receptors, which may be used to predict how the drug will attach to target proteins to elucidate the underlying biochemical processes that are disrupted in pathological conditions [14]. Over many years, the concept of inflammation-induced cancer has been recognized, and numerous research has proven that pro-inflammatory cytokines in tumor microenvironment influence every stage of tumor development and treatment efficacy[15]. These inflammatory cytokines are considered a promising target in several cancer treatments. Among various cytokines, TNF-α and TGF-β are essential in playing different functions at various stages of tumor development [16]. TNF-α is an important inflammation-causing cytokine, mostly produced through macrophages, although it is also secreted by various malignant cells that promote tumor metastasis, migration, proliferation and invasion through activating TNF-α-induced PKCα-, NF-кB, and AP-1signaling pathway [17]. Previous research has shown that serum levels of TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines were considerably greater in HCC patients compared to healthy individuals; hence, elevated TNF-α levels were linked to HCC progression and development [18]. Notably, TGF-β has a dual function in cancer development. At early stages, it inhibits cell proliferation by initiating apoptosis in cancer cells. While at later stages, it promoted tumor growth by inducing angiogenesis, immune suppression, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma by activating the TGF-β/Smad pathway [19]. A high-throughput proteomics analysis of early HCC tissue samples demonstrated that invasive HCC tissues were found to have a significant expression of TGF-β levels [20]. Furthermore, nitric oxide is generated by endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS(iNOS) and is involved in the initiation and development of cancer [21]. Excessive or prolonged NO synthesis has been linked with various characteristics of tumor formation, such as genomic instability, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, and metastasis [22]. Elevated levels of NO (1200 μmol/L) were observed in HCC patients before undergoing radiofrequency thermal ablation than control (22 μmol/L). Bacopa monnieri, locally known as Brahmi, belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is a small creeping herb that grows in moist areas throughout Europe, Australia, India, Asia, Africa, and South and North America [23]. B. monnieri is an excellent reservoir of bioactive compounds, including bacoside A & B, triterpenoid saponins, nicotine, betulinic acid, stigmasterol, bacopasides I & II, herpestine, D-mannitol, cucurbitacin, and several others are extensively investigated for their antioxidant, nootropic, bactericidal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anticancer properties [24]. Extensive research and clinical studies support these conventional pharmacological assertions. Traditionally, it is widely used to treat a variety of oxidative stress-related health disorders, such as neurological disorders, malignancies, diabetes, and heart complications [25]. Different B. monneiri extracts and their valuable phytochemicals showed promising anti-tumor effects by suppressing proliferation, stimulating apoptosis, and reducing migration and invasion in several human cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 & MCF-7 (breast cancer), HT-29 (colon cancer), DU-145 (prostate cancer) and Cal33 & FaDu (oral cancer)[26, 27]. In another study, it was observed that bacoside A showed an anti-metatastic effect in Wistar albino rats with DEN-induced HCC by downregulating the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and lipid peroxidation along with increased antioxidant enzymes levels [28]. Recently, no study has been available in elucidating the therapeutic potential of B. monnieri extracts to evaluate the underlying mechanism of TNF-α, TGF-β, and iNOS having a well-established role in HCC development. In our study, we determined the antioxidative, antiproliferative, and apoptotic activities of B. monnieri extracts using various in-vitro methods. This is the first-hand report to pinpoint the active anti-HCC ingredients of B. monnieri after targeting TNF-α, TGF-β, and iNOS proteins through molecular docking. This study will provide a solid scientific reason for the use of natural alternatives for the HCC treatment, but further research is required to verify the therapeutics of selected phytoconstituents in clinical and in-vivo trials. All analytical grade chemicals and solvents were obtained from different companies. The whole plant of B. monnieri (L.) Wettst was purchased from the local herbal market in Lahore, Pakistan. At Government College University (Lahore, Pakistan), a taxonomist identified and gave a voucher number of GC. Herb.Bot-3781 to the plant. It was submitted to the Government College University Herbarium Bank. The plant extracts were prepared according to the protocol given by Al-Nuri [29]. The leaves were dried under shade and were ground into powder by a laboratory grinding mill. The plant was macerated in ethanol (90%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and n-hexane (95%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) solvents for two weeks. After maceration, a rotary evaporator was used to concentrate the filtered solution at 40 ºC (Heidolph Hei-Vap, Germany). This concentrated mixture was achieved with lyophilizer, and a percentage yield of 11.55% of ethanolic and 7.35% of n-hexane extracts of B. monnieri was obtained. The concentration of total flavonoids was measured through a colorimetric aluminum chloride assay given by Phuyal and colleagues [30]. The absorbances were taken at 510 nm. The quantity of TFCs (total flavonoids contents) was estimated as mg equivalents of quercetin/g of dry extract using the standard curve obtained from the known concentrations of standard reagent. The concentration of TPCs (total phenolic contents) was measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure [31]. TPCs were noted as mg GAE/g of dry extract). Tannins concentration was estimated following the Folin-Ciocalteu method [32]. Concentrations were estimated as mgTAE/g of dried weight of plant extracts. For GC-MS analysis, lyophilized samples of B. monnieri were sent to the ICCBS center (International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences) at Karachi University to identify different phytocompounds [33]. The instrument utilized was a TQQQ Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) with a QP-5000 MS (mass spectrometer; quadruple) and a polydimethylsiloxane-clad capillary GC column. As a mobile phase, 99.99% pure helium was used to flow constantly at an average of 1 mL/min. At 250 ºC, the temperature of the injector was maintained with a 1 L injection volume having a 10:1 split ratio. The temperature in the oven was initially operated for 3 minutes at 50 °C, then increased by 7 °C per minute to 280 °C over 25 minutes before being raised to 300 °C (final temperature). For GC–MS spectrum detection, samples were conducted at 40–600 m/z with a scanning period of 0.2 seconds and 70 electron volts of ionization energy. The phytochemicals were detected by comparing the peak height, peak area %, retention time, and the diverse patterns of the mass spectrum of all phytochemicals found in the sample extracts with the spectral database of already available reference compounds present in the NIST library (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The antioxidant ability of plant extracts in terms of scavenging free radicals was evaluated in a procedure given by Braca [34]. Firstly, a fresh DPPH stock solution was made with 0.004% w/v in 95 percent methanol. To make stock solutions, 5 mg of ascorbic acid (standard reagent) and plant extracts were mixed in their mother solvents. Different concentrations (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 μg/mL) of plant extracts, along with reference reagent (ascorbic acid), were used to prepare by sequential dilutions. Each sample (0.1 mL) was combined with DPPH solution (3 mL) and stored in a pitch-dark area for thirty minutes after thoroughly shaking. A control was also prepared using the same reagents but without plant extracts. The optical density of extracts and ascorbic acid was recorded spectrophotometrically with the wavelength of 517 nm against blank. The percent inhibition of the free radicals was calculated by the following equation: Nitric oxide is formed by Na2[Fe(CN)5NO] (sodium nitroprusside), and their scavenging potential was evaluated using the method given by Kamble [35]. In the reaction mixture, 1.0 mL of PBS (phosphate buffer saline; pH 7.4), 0.5 mL of sodium nitroprusside (10 mM), 1.0 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and 1.0 mL of each sample at varying concentrations ranging from 50 to 250 µg/mL, was kept for 4 hours at ambient temperature. A control was prepared using the aforementioned reagents but without plant extract. The mixture was undergoing centrifugation for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. Afterwards, 0.5 mL of Griess reagent was mixed with 0.5 mL of supernatant, and results were measured at 546 nm. Ascorbic acid was used as a reference reagent. The reduction percentage of RNS was estimated through the given formula: The antioxidant potential of crude extracts to inhibit superoxide anion radicals was evaluated by a previously described procedure [36]. The reaction mixture contains 1.0 mL of both nitroblue tetrazolium [(1M of NBT in PBS (100 mM; pH 7.4) and NADH solution (1M of NADH in PBS (100 mM; pH 7.4)], 1.0 mL of and 0.1 mL of each plant extract or standard reagent (both have concentrations ranging between 50–250 μg/mL). Additionally, 0.1 mL of phenazine methosulphate solution started the reaction and was kept at 20 °C for five minutes. The readings of each sample were taken at 560 nm compared to blank. A control was made with the same reagents except any plant extracts. The following equation was used to determine the scavenging capacity of plant samples: The potential of plant extracts to scavenge hydrogen peroxide radicals was determined using a previously given method [37]. A fresh solution of hydrogen peroxide (2.0 mM) was prepared with the help of phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4; 50 mM). Briefly, 0.1 mL of sample (at varying concentrations of 50–250 μg/mL) was added into 0.3 mL of PBS and 0.6 mL of H2O2 solution and left the mixture for ten minutes at 37 °C. The absorbance of all testing samples and ascorbic acid was measured at 230 nm against blank. The scavenging of hydrogen peroxide was calculated by the following equation: The human liver cancer cell line (HepG2) was obtained from cell line BioBank present at the IMBB (Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology), The University of Lahore, Pakistan. The HepG2 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Minimum Essential Medium) that was supplemented with antibiotic (streptomycin/penicillin) and fetal bovine serum (10% FBS). The cells were cultured in a T-75 cell culture flask and incubated at 37 ºC with 5% CO2 and 95% air in an incubator (BioTek, Korea). The media was changed every 3–4 days to ensure proper cell growth. The cells were re-cultured after every four to five days [38]. Based on treatments, HepG2 cells were segregated into four distinct groups. As a negative control, cells that received DMEM medium were designated as the untreated cells (UT). The other two groups were treated with different BME and BMH extract doses. As a positive control, cisplatin (a commonly used FDA-approved anticancer drug) was given at varying concentrations to the final (fourth) group for comparison. The cytotoxic activity of plant extracts was estimated via the standard protocol of MTT assay [39]. HepG2 cells (1x104 cells/well) were seeded in a 96-well culture plate. After incubation of 24 hours, cells received increasing concentrations (10, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL) of the plant extracts and cisplatin (positive control) [40], while untreated cells served as negative control received only media. These cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for the next twenty-four hours. After incubation, cells were rinsed using 200 µL of PBS following the removal of media. Then, MTT reagent (25 μL) was introduced in each well and left at 37 °C for 3 hours. Then, the formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO after removing MTT dye. The results were taken at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotommeter (BioRad, Singapore). Every experiment was conducted in triplicates. The non-linear regression analysis was utilized to calculate the IC50 values using a graph pad prism (version 5.03). To observe the therapeutic impact of BME and BMH extracts on the cancer cell morphologies, 1x104 cells were cultivated in a 96-well flat bottom plate. The cultured cells were exposed to different doses (10 μg/mL, 25 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL) of both plant extracts and cisplatin for 24 hrs, and the images of morphological changes were observed using a microscope [35]. The percentages of adherent cells, or live HepG2 cells, were measured by crystal violet staining [41]. After the cultivated cells were seeded in a 96-well plate, they were treated for 24 hours with various IC50 concentrations of crude extracts and cisplatin, which were calculated using the MTT assay. Following treatment, the medium was removed using PBS solution, and 0.05 mL of crystal violet dye (0.5%) was introduced in each well for staining live cells. These plates were left at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then, the excess stain was washed out with PBS. After drying overnight, the extra stain was removed from the treated cells by applying 50 µL of ethanoic acid (10%). The absorbances were estimated at 600 nm. The percent HepG2 cell viability was estimated after the administration of plant extracts and cisplatin in the following way: To estimate the apoptosis effect induced by the extracts in cancer cells, the apoptotic activity was measured following the kit manufacturer’s instructions (annexin V/PI) (Merck-Millipore; MCH100105) [42]. HepG2 cells (5x105 cells per well) were grown on 12-well plates and then exposed to respective IC50 concentrations of cisplatin and extracts for treatment. The cancer cells were centrifuged for 5 mins at 1000 rpm, washed with PBS, and put in 1x binding buffer (100 µL). Then, propidium iodide (10 µL) and annexin V-FITC binding (5 µL) were used to stain the suspended cells and left at room temperature for 15 minutes. The automated cell Muse Analyzer (Merck-Millipore) was used to measure the outcomes of cell death induction. Three-dimensional TNF-α, TGF-βR1 and iNOS structures, having the PDB IDs 2AZ5 (only chain A), 1RW8 (only chain A), and 4NOS, respectively, were retrieved from Protein Data Bank. These proteins were selected as a molecular target for this investigation because these are implicated in many processes of liver disorders that, if not treated at an early stage, may develop into hepatocellular carcinoma. Targeting these proteins may reduce the severity of various advanced hepatic complications. The selected target proteins were prepared by eliminating undesired co-crystallized ligands and water molecules before the addition of partial charges allocated to atoms, Gasteiger charges, Kollman charges and polar hydrogen using Discovery Studio [43]. The prediction of active sites is to determine the precise functional region of the protein to comprehend its activity. The active amino acid residues in binding pockets of target receptors were inferred using the literature survey or using PYMOL [44]. Specified dimensions of different grid boxes for target macromolecules are depicted in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t001 Different phytocompounds were screened in both extracts of B. monnieri using GC-MS analysis to investigate the potent hepatoprotective drug candidates. The structures of identified compounds were downloaded in SDF files from the PubChem or ChemSpider databases and saved in a pdb file. The ligands were optimized through energy minimization and changed to a Pdbqt file by utilizing the AutoDock Vina program for further analysis [45]. The drug-likeness of identified phytochemicals was predicted using SwissADME software. The drug-likeness of a phytoconstituent depends on following Lipinski’s rules. SwissADME (https://www.SwissADME.ch) is a tool to investigate different parameters of Lipinski’s rules [46]. PkCSM (https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/pkcsm/prediction) and admetSAR (http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/) are free online software that was used for various toxicity parameters assessment. Hepatotoxicity was assessed using the pkCSM program [47], whereas acute oral toxicity, carcinogenicity mutagenicity, and acute oral toxicity variables were determined utilizing the admetSAR tool [48]. Compounds were selected based on drug-like properties for molecular docking to identify a safe drug. To predict these parameters, the software was uploaded with the canonical SMILES of the ligands. This computational study excluded the natural chemicals that had one or more violations of Lipinski’s rules or displayed a positive sign for any toxicity parameter. The filtered compounds were further subjected to molecular docking against selected target proteins. The drug-like ligands and proteins were prepared using the AutoDock vina tool (version 1.5.7), which reduced energy and set a grid box to cover all amino acids in the active site defined by co-crystallization. Both molecules (proteins and ligands) were converted and saved in a pdbqt format [49]. Vina used a global optimization algorithm to accomplish docking, taking information from both input files (proteins and ligands) and specified dimensions listed in the configuration file of the grid box. After connecting with the target receptors, nine different conformations were generated for each ligand; the best binding affinities were used to select the ideal position [50]. Macromolecules were taken as rigid entities during the docking process, and different conformations were produced by maintaining the flexibility of ligands. The lowest favorable binding energy establishes the stable association between the target receptor and ligand, having an RMSD value <1Å (Angstrom), which is defined as its lowest favorable binding energy. The lowest binding affinities and the molecular interactions of phytocompounds with active site residues of target proteins were analyzed in detail compared to standard drug [51]. To form a stable docked complex, the target macromolecule was aligned with a stable conformer that was selected based on best binding affinities [52]. PYMOL (version 2.5.4) was utilized to analyze the post-dock outcomes by further examining and visualizing the docked complexes. The 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images were captured by BIOVIA Discovery Studio (client 2021) [53]. The ligand-protein interactions are involved in forming stable docked complexes and are measured using a web server protein-ligand profiler [54]. Usually, the selected drug candidates were subjected to the ADMET analysis (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity) using different online software to predict their safety in animal and human systems. The initial toxicological study of the expected candidate is a fundamental step in designing and developing a safe and effective medicine before undergoing a pharmacological trial [55]. We used the PkCSM tool for early-stage toxicological and pharmacokinetic profiling of selected plant-based chemicals [56]. All the data was evaluated by one-way ANOVA (analysis of variances) with post-hoc Tukey’s test for comparison between treatment groups. For data analysis and IC50 calculations, GraphPad Prism (version 5.03) and Statistix (version 8.0) software were used for data analysis. Results were given as mean ± Standard deviation of three independent experiments (n=3). It is observed that analysis was statistically significant at p-value < 0.05. Before performing ANOVA, homogeneity of variance and normal distribution of data were evaluated using Bartlett’s and Shapiro-Wilks tests. It has been confirmed that the experimental data collection complied with relevant institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation with appropriate permissions from authorities of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, The University of Lahore, Lahore 54300, Pakistan. The concentration of important pharmacologically active agents in each plant extract was also measured quantitatively (Table 2). For all crude extracts, TFCs (total flavonoid contents) were calculated utilizing the linear regression equation taken from the standard curve of quercetin (y = 0.0023 x - 0.1754, R2 = 0.9904). The values of tannins and TPCs (total phenolic contents) in the experimental samples were determined by the tannic acid calibration curve equation (y = 0.0012x + 0.0644, R2 = 0.9855) and the standard curve equation of gallic acid (y = 0.0026x + 0.5142, R2 = 0.9976), respectively. In general, BME extract exhibited significantly higher contents of flavonoids, tannins, and phenols than BMH extract and has made an important contribution to their biological activities. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t002 GC-MS analysis detected different types and concentrations of natural compounds in both extracts of B. monnieri. These identified compounds are given in Fig 1. The secondary metabolites present in both extracts of B. monnieri belong to important classes of therapeutically important secondary metabolites such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, cholesterol, steroids, terpenoids, phytosterol, vitamins, sesquiterpene and phenolic compounds (Table 3). Most of these compounds were considered medicinally active due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-tumor attributes. Different solvents have varying polarities that are depicted with different peak locations and peak lengths in the chromatogram. The solubility of compounds in different solvents also affects their elution times. BME extract (A) identified a diverse array of polar compounds with higher peak lengths and earlier peak locations than BMH extract (B). Different solvents have varying polarities that are depicted with different peak locations and peak lengths in the chromatogram. The solubility of compounds in different solvents also affects their elution times. BME extract (A) identified a diverse array of polar compounds with higher peak lengths and earlier peak locations than BMH extract (B). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t003 Percentage free radical inhibition for the plant samples and standard antioxidants was calculated using DPPH antioxidant assay. The DPPH scavenging potential of B. monnieri extracts was observed to be statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) in a concentration-reliant manner (Fig 2A). In Table 4, BME extract showed the best DPPH radical scavenging activity with minimum IC50 concentration (26.84 μg/mL) and a higher percentage of free radicals inhibitions, while the weaker scavenging percentage was noticed in BMH extract with the higher IC50 concentration of 85.63 μg/mL. Ascorbic acid showed maximum inhibition of free radicals (IC50: 13.28 μg/mL) compared to plant extracts. The antiradical potential of plant extracts was found to decrease in the following order: ASA>BME>BMH. One-way ANOVA following Tukey’s test was used to analyze the data and found statistically significant at p-value < 0.05. The same letters indicated that the difference was not statistically significant, while different lower-case letters demonstrated statistically significant differences across groups. All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and expressed as mean±SD. One-way ANOVA following Tukey’s test was used to analyze the data and found statistically significant at p-value < 0.05. The same letters indicated that the difference was not statistically significant, while different lower-case letters demonstrated statistically significant differences across groups. All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and expressed as mean±SD. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t004 Each plant extract significantly (p-value < 0.05) increased the neutralization of nitric oxide radical with increasing concentrations, as given in Fig 2B. Among both extracts, the BME extract exhibited better scavenging of nitric oxide with an IC50 concentration of 46.04 μg/mL in comparison to BMH extract (IC50 value: 104.86 μg/mL). The higher inhibiting percentage of oxidant was observed in the case of ascorbic acid (IC50 value: 41.16 μg/mL). The decreasing antioxidant potential with increasing IC50 values was observed in the following order: ASA<BME<BMH (Table 4). Both B. monnieri extracts showed scavenging of superoxide anions in a concentration-dependent manner (50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 μg/mL) as depicted in Fig 2C. The antioxidant activity of B. monnieri extracts was observed to decrease in the following order: ASA>BME>BMH (Table 4; Fig 2C). BME extract showed stronger superoxide anion scavenging activity (IC50: 60.95 μg/mL) than BMH extract with an IC50 concentration of 135.44 μg/mL. These extracts showed modest antioxidant activity (p-value<0.05) when compared to ascorbic acid (IC50: 47.33 μg/mL). Despite this, both extracts act as strong superoxide anion scavengers to neutralize oxidative stress. The antioxidant potential of plant extracts and standard reagent was found to be higher with increasing concentrations (Fig 2D). Higher percentages of free radical scavenging were observed in BME extract (IC50: 78.08 μg/mL) compared to BMH extract (IC50: 128.21 μg/mL). Ascorbic acid served as a standard and showed higher antioxidant potential (p-value < 0.05) with an IC50 value of 50.83 μg/mL compared to both extracts. The decreasing percentage of quenching H2O2 radicals with increasing IC50 values was observed in the following order: ASA>BME>BMH. The cytotoxicity of plant extracts in terms of IC50 concentrations was evaluated using an MTT assay against the HepG2 cells. The experiment was done with various concentrations of each extract and cisplatin, which served as the reference drug for comparison. The findings showed that increasing the concentration of both extracts and cisplatin causes higher cytotoxicity by reducing the number of viable cells compared to untreated cells (Fig 3). With an IC50 value of 24.70 µg/mL, BME extract was shown to be more cytotoxic than BMH extract (41.47 μg/mL), as it significantly reduced the proliferation of malignant cells. Furthermore, cisplatin proved less cytotoxic (IC50 value: 25.83 μg/mL) toward cancer cells as compared to BME extract but more active than BMH extract. The IC50 values (fifty percent inhibition of cancer cells) of all samples are presented in Table 5. The cytotoxicity of testing samples was increased in HepG2 cells with decreasing IC50 values in the following order: BMH>Cisplatin>BME. (A) HepG2-cells treated with BME extract (B) HepG2-cells treated with BMH extract (C) HepG2-cells treated with cisplatin. Data from triplicate experiments was expressed as mean±SD. One-way ANOVA analysis with Tukey’s tests for multiple comparisons (p-value < 0.05) was performed and significant differences between treatment groups were represented by different lowercase letters. UT: untreated cells. (A) HepG2-cells treated with BME extract (B) HepG2-cells treated with BMH extract (C) HepG2-cells treated with cisplatin.

Neoplastic cells were observed to change their shape, structure, and size in a dose-reliant manner. At doses of 10, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL, BME and cisplatin sharply reduced the viability of HepG2 cells along with prominent degenerated cell morphologies. While on administration of BMH extract, any prominent alterations in the shape of viable cells were observed at higher concentrations (50 and 100 µg/mL) when compared to untreated cells. At doses of 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL, BME and cisplatin-induced remarkable morphological changes in cancer cells, whereas BMH extract started the induction of notable morphological changes at 50 µg/mL. BME: ethanolic extract of B. monnieri; BMH: B. monnieri n- hexane extract of B. monnieri; UT: untreated cells. The images were taken at 50× magnifying power using a Floid cell imaging station. At doses of 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL, BME and cisplatin-induced remarkable morphological changes in cancer cells, whereas BMH extract started the induction of notable morphological changes at 50 µg/mL. BME: ethanolic extract of B. monnieri; BMH: B. monnieri n- hexane extract of B. monnieri; UT: untreated cells. The images were taken at 50× magnifying power using a Floid cell imaging station. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g004 Crystal violet assay was used to determine the percentage cell viability of HepG2 cells. Following the treatment with varying IC50 concentrations of cisplatin and B. monnieri extracts, HepG2 cells were shown to have a higher level of apoptotic activity with the lower percentages of live cells in comparison to the untreated cells. A very small percentage of dead cells were seen in untreated HepG2 cells compared to treated groups (Fig 5). In short, BME extract was found to have a higher inhibitory potential on the multiplication of HepG2 cells with a lower viability percentage compared to BMH extract and cisplatin. Data from experiments were given as mean±SD (n=3) and considered statistically significant at a p-value less than 0.05. Different alphabets showed a significant difference between the treatment groups, and these results were obtained by performing one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test. UT: untreated; BME: B. monnieri ethanol extract-treated HepG2 cells; BMH: B. monnieri n-hexane extract-treated HepG2 cells; Cisplatin served as a positive control. Data from experiments were given as mean±SD (n=3) and considered statistically significant at a p-value less than 0.05. Different alphabets showed a significant difference between the treatment groups, and these results were obtained by performing one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test. UT: untreated; BME: B. monnieri ethanol extract-treated HepG2 cells; BMH: B. monnieri n-hexane extract-treated HepG2 cells; Cisplatin served as a positive control. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g005 Annexin V-FITC/PI kit was used to evaluate the apoptotic ability of plant extracts on HepG2 cells. Following treatment with extracts and cisplatin, the percentage of apoptotic induction in HepG2 cells is depicted in Fig 6. In BME-treated HepG2 cells, the higher percentage of apoptosis was 58.65% compared to its BMH extract (48.45%). This may be due to the presence of the higher concentrations of phytochemicals with anticancer potential. The apoptotic percentage of HepG2 cells treated with cisplatin was shown to be 58.95%. BME: B. monnieri ethanol extract; BMH: B. monnieri hexane extract; UT: untreated cells. BME: B. monnieri ethanol extract; BMH: B. monnieri hexane extract; UT: untreated cells. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g006 In comparison to untreated cells, all the treatment groups mostly showed an excessive amount of dead cells in their late apoptotic profiles. Following the incubating period, 1.15% of early apoptosis and 3.75% of late apoptosis were observed. The phytoconstituents showed at least one violation of Lipinski’s guidelines and a positive result for any of the selected toxicological parameters was removed from the in-silico analysis. Overall, only eight phytocompounds from both B. monnieri extracts were filtered following Lipinski’s rules and, without exhibiting any kind of toxicity, are listed in Table 6. Molecular docking was performed to assess the anticancer potential of these selected phytocompounds. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t006 Among selected compounds of B. monnieri, Spiro[(tricyclo[6.2.2.0(2,7)]dodeca-5,9- diene)-4,1’-cyclobutane]-11,2’-dione, 1,3,3,5,12,12-hexamethyl (compound A) screened from ethanol extract, followed by caryophyllene oxide (compound B) taken from n-hexane extract exhibited best docking score against anticancer targets as compared to the sorafenib. Selected drug-like compounds with binding affinities (kcal/mol) are shown in Table 7. Among the best-hits of B. monnieri, compound A showed the best binding affinities of −8.1, −8.8, and −7.8 against TGF-βR1, TNF-α, and iNOS as compared to sorafenib. Similarly, compound B exhibited binding affinities of −7.0 kcal/mol for TNF-α, −7.2 kcal/mol for TGF-βR1, and −7.8 kcal/mol for iNOS. This means that both extracts have competent lead compounds for the effective treatment of HCC. The 2-D and 3-D images of top-scorer docked complexes and their molecular interactions are given in Figs. 7 and 8. Overall, the BME extract and its active phytochemicals (compound A) with a multi-targeted approach exhibited higher cytotoxic and antioxidative potential by targeting cancer-causing proteins (TNF-α, TGF-βR1 and iNOS) having established role in initiation and progression of HCC. This may be due to the presence of higher concentrations of total flavonoids, phenols and tannins as observed in BME extract than in BMH extract. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.g008 After molecular docking, the lead compounds with high binding affinities with target proteins were selected. The interacting amino acids and their bond lengths implicated in the formation of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds of top-scorer phytochemicals from both extracts are shown in Table 8, Figs 7 and 8. In the flexible environment of protein, hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions are important to establish a stable binding of energetically favorable phytocompounds, which is an important step in identifying the drug lead with improved efficacy. Compound A from the BME extract and compound B from the BMH extract were found to have higher binding affinities towards TNF-α, TGF-βR1, and iNOS. The conformer A formed hydrogen bonds involving the amino acids, including Tyr 151 in TNF-α, Lys 232 in TGF-βR1, and Cys200 in iNOS. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t008 Furthermore, the same conformer established hydrophobic interactions with different amino acids: Tyr59, Tyr199 of TNF-α, Lys213, Val219, Lys232, Leu340, Ala350, and Asp351 of TGF-βR1 while Phe369 and Trp463 of iNOS. Moreover, compound B only formed hydrophobic interactions with selected target proteins to show their bioactivity. While this phytocompound established several hydrophobic interactions with amino acids of respective target proteins, such as Leu57, Tyr59, and Tyr119 residues of TNF-α, Lys213, Val219, Leu260 and Leu340 of TGF-βR1, and Leu125, Ala197, Arg199, Phe369, Phe488, Tyr 489 and Tyr491of iNOS. Overall, compound A of the BME extract exhibited a strong bioactivity with high docking scores compared to other extract. It has been found that lead compounds from BME extract may have the potential to be used in anti-HCC drug development. The pharmacokinetic prediction of the best-hit natural chemicals, including compound A from BME extract and compound B from BMH extract, is depicted in Table 9 as computed by pKCSM. According to a review of the relevant literature, the Ames test is crucial for a compound of interest, and its positive result indicates its mutagenicity and is unable to be further processed as a drug. Both compounds were non-mutagenic. The better aqueous solubility (-4.958), absorption in the human intestine (98.074), and Caco-2 permeability (1.52) were shown by compound A than compound B. Higher gastrointestinal absorption was shown by each compound, which is important for oral drug absorption into the human body. It was also anticipated that both drug-like compounds would be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and aid in the management of neurological conditions. Both compounds metabolize CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 during drug metabolism. Similarly, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 were inhibited by both phytocompounds. No substance was predicted to be an inhibitor of herG-I and herG-II, and it was not involved in cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Only compound A is positive for the OCT2-substrate and readily secreted by the kidney. Both phytochemicals had varying total clearance values, with compound A predicted with the value of 0.905 and efficiently eliminated from the body as compared to other compounds (0.445). The maximum tolerated dose observed in humans is -0.488 in compound A and 0.148 in compound B. This means that compound B is well-tolerated in humans before inducing any side effects than compound 1. Moreover, compound B exhibited slightly more oral acute rat toxicity with 1.548, and oral chronic rat toxicity with 1.224 as compared to compound A. Compound A proved slightly more toxic than compound B with low values of 0.743 and 0.574 for T. pyriformis and minnow toxicity. Overall, to enhance the biological activity and stability of phytochemicals as a potential drug, slight modifications in their native structures are necessary. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321445.t009 Due to several contributing variables, including genetics and epigenetics, as well as a dearth of effective treatments, liver cancer has emerged as among the main reasons for cancer mortalities globally [57]. Chemotherapeutic drugs are efficacious for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, but their high toxicity, significant side effects, and long-term drug resistance limit clinical outcomes along with increasing death rates [58]. The resurgence in popularity and dependence on medicinal plants as alternative medicines aims to overcome the deficiencies linked with the use of synthetic chemotherapeutic drugs [59]. Various research evidence was reported to bolster the use of traditional medicinal plants in effective HCC regimens [60]. Natural phytochemicals present in medicinal plant extracts activate antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory effects, suppressing the signaling pathways responsible for cancer development and promoting mechanisms linked to disease prevention [61]. The interaction of different natural agents with the efficacy of anticancer treatment is well-recognized. Therefore, the current study focuses on alternate natural therapies for the prevention and management of hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, medicinal plants with a wide range of bioactive compounds have become popular in the treatment of several inflammation-induced malignancies. In the present study, BME extract exhibited a higher concentration of TPCs (274.92±3.52 mgGAE/g), TFCs (141.99±4.14 mgQAE/g), and tannins (55.49±4.63 mgTAE/g) as compared to BMH extract. Our results are greater than those of the previously published study on methanolic extract; this discrepancy may be due to changes in plant extract preparation or sample collection methods [62]. The literature revealed that B. monnieri methanolic extract showed a higher concentration of these phytochemicals during phytochemical profiling [23]. Phenolic compounds like polyphenols have many medicinal actions, such as being anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, antiproliferative, and cardioprotective. Flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, and other active metabolites are abundant in plants and have therapeutic properties. These plant-derived active metabolites reduce free radicals and enhance metal chelation [63]. It also protects from severe damage, such as lipid membrane peroxidation, protein deterioration, and DNA mutation brought on by reactive oxygen species [64]. In total, forty-six compounds were screened by GCMS analysis from both extracts of B. monnieri. The identified molecules that have been found are part of the significant class of phytochemicals, which includes triglycerides, fatty acid esters, triterpene, steroids, phytosterol, and straight-chain alcohol, among many others. The major components were hexadecanoic acid,2-methyl-, methyl ester, ethyl linolenate, and trilinolein in BME extract, while in BMH extract was squalene, stigmasterol, 1-monolinoleoyl glycerol trimethylsilyl ether, and many others. Hexadecanoic acid,2-methyl-, was reported to have anticancer activity against the HT-29 cancer cell line [65]. Stigmasterol showed an inhibitory effect by causing cell cycle arrest (G1) in endometrial cancer via suppressing IGF1R/mTOR/Akt pathway [66]. A diverse range of bioactive compounds with anti-tumor properties are also present in both extracts. Our results showed that BME extract exhibited a higher level of concentration-dependent antioxidant activity by neutralizing free radicals, including DPPH, NO, H2O2, and superoxide anions, than BMH extract, as shown in Fig 2 and Table 4. This may be due to the polarity of ethanol to extract more polar antioxidant phytochemicals, which give better results as compared to other solvents [67]. Similarly, a previous study showed a higher antioxidant activity of methanolic B. monnieri extract using various in-vitro antioxidant assays [68]. The increased antioxidant activity could be the cause of the higher concentration of bioactive secondary metabolites in their respective extracts. The therapeutic potential of pharmacologically significant phytocompounds from BME and BMH extracts requires extensive research. Hence, a previous study linked natural agents and conventional plant-based medicines that are useful in treating liver cancer; however, their investigation was restricted to clinical trials [69]. These natural components employ their anti-tumor effect by activating several anti-proliferative processes but usually induce apoptosis in cancerous cells to halt their growth [70]. In the current study, the cytotoxicity of BME and BMH extracts was concentration-dependent, as observed against HepG2 cells using MTT assay (Fig 3). Different inhibitory responses were observed at varying concentrations (10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL) of cisplatin, BME, and BMH extracts. The IC50 values in terms of cytotoxicity are given in Table 5. According to the American Cancer Research Center, a crude extract is considered a potent cytotoxic agent if its IC50 concentration is less than 30 µg/mL [71]. Our results demonstrated that BME extract (IC50: 24.77 µg/mL) was observed to be more pronounced than other extracts. These results agree with other studies in which ethanolic and dichloromethane fractions of B. monnieri showed good cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell lines [72]. Contrary to our research, B. monnieri hexane extract exhibited a better anti-proliferative effect with an IC50 value of 53.0 μg/mL on MCF-7 cells [73]. Our findings demonstrated that a higher percentage of apoptosis was induced by BME extract (58.65%) and cisplatin (58.95%) on HepG2 cells in comparison to BMH extract (48.45%) as depicted in Fig 6. Cisplatin can interfere with the DNA repair mechanism by cross-linking purine bases, leading to DNA damage that ultimately activates apoptotic signaling pathways in cancer cells [74]. These findings agree with the preceding research [75]. This is the first report to show the apoptotic induction of B. monnieri extracts on HepG2 cells. Moreover, the cell viability assessment of both extracts was done by crystal violet assay, and the results are presented in Fig 5. The reduced cell proliferation of HepG2 cells was observed at 36.83%, 44.48%, and 57.32% for BME, BMH, and cisplatin, respectively. In both extracts, BME extract demonstrated noticeable cytotoxicity with lower percentage of viable cells. In 2019, the combined effect of bacopaside I and II, isolated from B. monnieri, effectively decreased the proliferation, invasion, and migration of MDA-MB-231 & BT-474 through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [76]. Thus, it is suggested that a significant number of HepG2 cells undergo apoptotic cell death following treatment with BME extract, and this extract may have the ability to develop into a potent anti-cancer drug. Furthermore, the literature demonstrates that both oxidative stress and inflammation may lead to initiate angiogenesis and cancer progression [77]. Synthetic drug targeting is a monotargeted approach may not be functional due to the complexity of cancer; therefore, the best mode of action is to target several receptors to inhibit cell multiplication. There has been debate that multi-target therapies can mitigate the difficulties caused by acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs [78]. The selected natural chemicals undergo docking to overcome these challenges and explore their anticancer potential for better treatment strategies [79]. Before conducting additional experiments, the computational approach assessed the binding affinities of possible drug candidate against target proteins that are associated with disease progression [80]. Phytocompounds may target various deregulated signaling pathways, including NF-кB, PI3K/mTOR, MAPKs, AMPKs, TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin and JNK/STAT3 pathways in various cancers [81]. As we know, the HCC tumor microenvironment is a complex and dynamic system of stromal and immune cells communicating with tumor cells, and novel immunotherapeutics are required to target and manage resistance observed during treatment [82]. Current evidence suggests that TNF-α is an inflammatory mediator with a molecular connection between sustained inflammation and the emergence of several malignancies [83]. Additionally, research demonstrated that elevated TNF-α expression levels were observed in HCC liver tissues, and anti-TNFα treatment may suppress the progression of HCC [84, 85]. TGF-β is significantly enhanced in several malignancies, including HCC. A recent study revealed that inhibition of TGF-β increases the cytotoxic efficacy of therapies by targeting the EGFR [86] while TGF-βR1 is a key receptor for its activation. Another research reported that ginseng extract has an anti-fibrotic impact by downregulating the TGF-βR1 and TGF-β/Smad pathway [87]. Moreover, nitric oxide is excessively expressed in neoplastic lesions, is generated by iNOS during inflammation, and is involved in cancer progression [88]. It has been reported that iNOS is overexpressed in HCC and patients with fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatitis [89]. Dealing with these inflammatory mediators and their underlying pathways in preclinical studies to inhibit hepatocarcinogenesis, may suggest its therapeutic role in treating inflammation-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we selected the target proteins such as TNF-α, TGF-β and iNOS having significant roles in HCC development. In present-day research, the binding energies of selected bioactive phytocompounds against selected target macromolecules are shown in Table 7. Overall, among selected drug-like compounds of both extracts of B. monnieri, the Spiro[(tricyclo[6.2.2.0(2,7)]dodeca-5,9- diene)-4,1’-cyclobutane]-11,2’-dione, 1,3,3,5,12,12-hexamethyl from BME extract exhibited the best-hit score against all target proteins, followed by caryophyllene oxide selected from BMH extract. The present study showed a valuable in-sight into the anticancer potential of BME extract, but further research is needed to explore their effective therapeutics before integrating them into the final product. A selected phytocompound with improved stability, bioavailability, and cell-directed delivery should be investigated in animal models. Subsequently, these compounds undergo clinical trials to verify their toxicity, safety and efficacy profile prior to regulatory authorization. The best-hit compounds of BME extract with significant antiproliferative potential, are selected due to their strong potency in the development of alternative anticancer drugs. In our study, in vitro and in silico approaches were used to evaluate the hepatoprotective potential of ethanol and n-hexane extracts of B. monnieri. BME extract was found to be more active in suppressing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress due to the presence of valuable phytochemicals. Furthermore, the in silico attempt further confirmed the multi-targeted anticancer effect of phytochemicals identified in BME extract through the GCMS analysis. However, further investigations are needed at molecular and metabolic levels to explore its therapeutics against liver cancer before the development of novel plant-based drugs. The authors would also like to extend their sincere appreciation to the Researchers Supporting Project Number (RSP2025R350), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Bitcoin is making headlines again, and for all the right reasons. From Saylor’s Strategy to Asia’s Metaplanet, Bitcoin treasuries are proliferating. At the same time, analysts predict new all-time highs could be mere weeks away. And now, BTC Bull token offers a high-octane way to ride the momentum. Bitcoin is once again proving its staying power, not just as a speculative asset, but as a bona fide treasury reserve tool for major firms. More and more companies are creating their own treasuries, with new companies forming explicitly for that purpose. The wider Bitcoin community is electric. Analysts point out that Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a stable store of value, especially amid political uncertainty surrounding U.S. policies. Community sentiment around Bitcoin on sites like CoinMarketCap, Twitter, and Reddit has surged over the past month. While the crypto Fear & Greed index is sitting solidly neutral at 51, that’s mainly because altcoins have lost ground to Bitcoin’s dominance. Some experts are forecasting new all-time highs as early as May. There are many reasons behind the predictions – first-quarter earnings, Trump’s aggressive pro-crypto stance – but one factor in particular is driving discussion. What’s driving the divergence? Bitcoin’s position as an independent asset has never been stronger. Multi-billion-dollar companies are building $BTC treasuries and spending USD to do it. Why? In hopes that $BTC decouples from the broader market and charts its own path upwards, potentially to highs above the previous mark of $104K. The stock market has been mired in uncertainty in the wake of US President Trump’s erratic and abrupt moves. It’s also sent investors scurrying for so-called ‘safe haven’ assets not tied directly to stock market performance. Bitcoin has proved to be the best of the bunch, outperforming everything and lending credence to the apparent decoupling trend. In fact, the old perception of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation may be giving way to Bitcoin as a hedge against even worse. That would be an ironic development, given crypto’s notorious volatility. In any event, the search for a safe haven is bullish for Bitcoin, but the massive capital inflow also means it’s getting harder for smaller investors to really benefit. BTC Bull says yes. Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) provides a unique solution to this challenge. The project is designed to offer leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s gains without the complexities of margin trading or futures contracts. $BTCBULL offers strategic token burns and key airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches critical price points. Each milestone triggers a response by the protocol, designed to tie $BTC and $BTCBULL’s price growth together. The combination of token burns + $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrops gives token holders three ways to earn: Stack BTC Bull’s three ways to earn on top of Bitcoin’s natural price potential, and it’s no wonder that the BTC Bull presale has already passed the $5M mark. Check out our guide on how to buy BTC Bull token, and see why we think the token price can reach $0.00835 from its current price of $0.002485 by the end of the year. Visit the BTC Bull token presale. Bitcoin’s growing perception as a safe haven and institutional reserve asset aligns perfectly with $BTCBULL’s value proposition. With memecoin fervor high and traders continuing to chase gains, projects like Bitcoin Bull are uniquely positioned to capture both mainstream and crypto-native attention.

The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems. But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results. Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking. Akhetonics is a German photonics startup working on an all-optical, general-purpose chip — a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raise a €6 million seed funding round led by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. Alice & Bob is a French startup that raised a $104 million Series B round of funding in January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies on cat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction. Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWS introduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company’s first quantum chip, AWS had previously launched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others. Atom Computing is a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms. At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans to launch a commercial quantum computer in 2025. D-Wave is a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, the Advantage2 prototype, relies on a process called quantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem. Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE. Illinois-based EeroQ is a startup betting on helium for its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 toward expanding its HQ in Chicago’s Humboldt Park. In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developed a 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer at the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023. In December 2024, Google announced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. Google didn’t stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement that made headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow’s performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.” IBM’s quantum efforts include Condor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, and Heron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates. Intel is developing quantum computers based on silicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn’t happened. IonQ is a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including the IonQ Forte. After going public via a SPAC in late 2021, it acquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. IQM is a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers and is a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional support from the EIC Accelerator program. In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the €39 million led by MIG Fonds it had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A. This second tranche included part of a previously announced €35 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as participation from the EIC Fund and others. In February 2025, Microsoft introduced Majorana, a quantum chip using a topological core architecture. Microsoft previously declared that it expected to build a quantum supercomputer within 10 years. Pasqal is a French startup taking a full-stack approach to quantum computing and betting on neutral atoms. The company emerged out of the Institut d’Optique in 2019, and its co-founders include 2022 Nobel Prize laureate for physics and professor Alain Aspect. In February 2023, Pascal raised a €100 million Series B funding round led by Singapore’s Temasek, with participation from existing investors Quantonation, the Defense Innovation Fund, Daphni, and Eni Next, as well as new investors European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Wa’ed Ventures, and Bpifrance (through its Large Venture Fund). PsiQuantum is a quantum computing startup using photonics technology and aiming to build “a 1 million-quantum-bit machine.” In February 2025, it announced Omega, a quantum photonic chipset manufactured at GlobalFoundries in New York. In 2021, PsiQuantum landed a $450 million Series D investment led by BlackRock, which is now said to be leading a potential $750 million round into the company at a $6 billion pre-money valuation. Founded by Australian academics, it is also backed by the Australian and Queensland governments. Qilimanjaro is a Spanish startup focusing on analog quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs) and taking a full-stack approach, including hardware, software, and applications. Based in Barcelona, it won the Four Years From Now startup competition at Mobile World Congress in 2024, going on to receive €1.5 million in funding from Catalonia later that year. Quandela is a French startup founded in 2017 to develop photonic quantum computers. In November 2023, Quandela raised a €50 million Series B and received support from the French government through the France 2030 Plan. Quantinuum is a quantum computing company formed in 2021 by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Its flagship product is the H-Series of trapped-ion quantum computers. In April 2024, together with Microsoft, it announced a breakthrough in error correction. QuantWare is a Dutch startup that came up with a proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, which focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs). It started accepting preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction, in February 2025. Founded in 2020, it is a spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech. In March 2025, and following a €6 million seed round in 2023, it announced having raised a €20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) — including €5 million in equity out of the €7.5 million it previously secured from the European Innovation Council (the remainder is a grant). Boston-based QuEra is betting on neutral atoms as the “best approach to achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.” Its products include Aquila, a 256-qubit analog neutral-atom quantum computer launched in 2022 and accessible via Amazon Braket. QuEra is notably backed by Google, which led the $230 debt round that the quantum startup raised in February 2025 — with a convertible note also backed by SoftBank, Valor, and existing investors. Founded in 2013 by Chad Rigetti, Rigetti Computing is a quantum company focusing on superconducting technology. Its range of products include Ankaa-3 and the uppcoming 336-qubit Lyra system. Just like rivals D-Wave and IonQ, Rigetti Computing is a listed company; it raised just under $200 million in VC capital before going public via a SPAC in 2021. In February 2025, it signed a strategic partnership with Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, which is set to invest $35 million and purchase shares of Rigetti, while both companies invest more than $100 million each over the next five years to accelerate the development and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing. U.S. quantum startup SEEQC — an acronym for “scalable, energy efficient quantum computing” — is a spinout of chip company Hypres, which was itself established by former employees of IBM’s superconducting electronics division. In 2023, SEEQC announced a partnership with Nvidia to build an “all-digital, ultra-low-latency chip-to-chip link between quantum computers and GPUs.” In January 2025, SEEQC raised a $30 million round of funding co-led by Booz Allen Ventures and Japanese-European VC firm NordicNinja. Other backers include Merck’s corporate venture capital arm, M Ventures. SEEQC is leading the U.K.-supported QuPharma project to explore how quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery, in partnership with BASF and Merck. SpinQ is a Chinese startup founded in 2018 that develops quantum computers. It claims that some of them are portable and making use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Xanadu is a Canadian startup aiming to build quantum computers through a photonic approach. In January 2025, it introduced Aurora, a 12-qubit system, including 35 photonic chips. Founded in 2016, Xanadu raised some $275 million to date, including a $100 million Series C in November 2022 at a $1 billion valuation.

Title: Expect to Pay More for These Groceries Because of Tariffs

Time Published: 2025-04-28T13:21:00Z

We asked an an expert about which groceries will become more expensive or hard to find as a result of President Trump's tariffs and ongoing trade war. Grocery inflation may rise even further when the tariffs go back into effect. The scope of President Donald Trump's trade war changes by the day. Beyond sending the stock market into disarray and consumer confidence plummeting to 1980s levels, the tariffs are expected to increase inflation to historic highs, particularly in key sectors that center on imports. The global food supply chain is complex, but groceries will be affected by tariffs in a specific way. Due to the climate, some foods, such as coffee and bananas, simply can't be grown en masse in the US. Just last week, Trump threatened new tariffs on countries that don't comply with his trade demands. China, the recipient of the most aggressive tariffs and the US's third largest trading partner shows no signs of concession. Trump also claimed in an interview with Time to have made 200 deals though, notably, none have been publicly announced. On April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, including China, Japan and the European Union. One week later as the tariffs were set to go into effect, he paused the majority of the tariffs for 90 days. Conversely, the sweeping tariff on Chinese imports was increased to 145%, Politico reports. In response, China increased tariffs against the US to 125%, bringing the US-China trade war to a boil. Your groceries might get more expensive if Trump's sweeping tariffs come to fruition. On April 9, just hours after Trump announced a 90-day pause, CNET spoke with Russell Hillberry, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, to learn how the "reciprocal" tariffs could affect grocery costs for shoppers in the US. Here's everything you need to know about what is happening right now and what could happen if the additional tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. Read more: Thinking About a Costco Membership? Here's How Much Cheaper Groceries Are "Yes." Hillberry said. "The US gets different products from different areas of the world. The goods are being sold for a certain amount and when they arrive at the port [in the US], there's an extra charge on top of whatever the value is at the port." That means that if items are imported to the US from China right now, when that item gets to the US, there will be an extra 145% charge on top of the original buying price when it arrives at the port. The majority of that extra cost from tariffs is typically passed on to the consumer. If the tariff was 10%, he estimated that roughly only 8% of that extra cost would be passed on to the consumer, which wouldn't make too much of a jaw-dropping difference to consumers especially on lower-cost items, such as groceries. However, the larger the tariff, the larger the price increase. Initially, the tariffs varied. For example, the EU -- where the US gets a lot of its wine and cheese -- is facing a 20% tariff with more potential tariffs on the horizon. If all of the tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 go into effect after the 90-day pause, Americans can expect to see an increase at the grocery store -- and possibly a change in what's available on the shelves. While China is not a large importer of food for the US, many of the countries that were slapped with tariffs on April 9 (before the pause) are.

This is a possibility if the tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. "One thing that isn't appreciated by the president is that countries have other buyers they can sell to," Hillberry said. "So if we decide we don't want them, they'll sell them somewhere else. And it may be that the supply chain can't justify the added costs that go with the tariffs, so some things might not be there." Seafood is one food category that may get significantly more expensive from tariffs. "The things that [the US] doesn't produce at scale, especially fish and shrimp, are coming largely from Asia, India, Vietnam, places like that," Hillberry said. "So those are going to be up 20 to 50% at the port and maybe a little bit less at the grocery store." Most coffee beans are imported, which puts them at risk for a price hike. While most foods will still be available, tariffs will cause a price spike and potential scarcity in key imports. "Coffee and bananas are going to come in, for sure, they'll just be more expensive," Hillberry stressed. "I wouldn't expect these things to vanish but I think you can expect less variety available at the supermarket because of the tariffs. But the main effect will be on prices." Adding guac to a burrito bowl may become even pricier in 2025. Many of the avocados, tomatoes and berries that the US consumes are grown in Mexico, so those products could also see a price hike related to tariffs. Much of the fruit we buy at the supermarket is imported from countries subject to tariffs both now and when the 90-day pause goes back into effect. Canadian whiskey has already been subjected to tariffs. Wine imported from Europe and liquor that comes from Canada, Mexico and parts of Asia are expected to jump in cost as tariffs continue to roll out. It is unclear but before the pause, Hillberry predicted that the Trump administration would abandon the tariffs because they're too painful or that Congress would step in to stop the tariffs, which could happen if they go back into effect. "I really don't think that these are permanent features of the landscape," Hillberry said. "But, you know, once tariffs go up, it does take a while for them to go down again. So I would think that on the food angle, things will be more expensive, not as good, lower quality, and some goods will disappear."

Good morning. A software engineer who has worked at Google and Meta compared their cultures, promotion processes, and workloads. Interestingly, the more stressful company was their favourite to work at. In today's big story, Donald Trump went after one of America's top law firms. Its decision to fight back took just two hours. What's on deck Markets: Early Tesla investor Ross Gerber told BI he's even "more disturbed" after its latest earnings. Tech: Microsoft is trying to simplify its AI sales pitch, slides obtained by BI reveal. Business: Your favorite Amazon products are about to get more expensive. But first, Trump is outgunned in court. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. An "existential crisis" is how Paul Weiss' chairman, Brad Karp, described it. President Donald Trump's slew of executive orders targeting high-profile law firms triggered a fight-or-flight response. Nine law firms took flight and struck deals with the president — Paul Weiss included — collectively promising $940 million in pro bono work for the administration. Four — Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, WilmerHale, and Susman Godfrey — opted to fight the administration in court. And they're winning. They've argued that the executive orders violate the Constitution, illegally target people and companies for their speech, and violate their clients' right to counsel. In a hearing on April 23, US District Judge Beryl Howell appeared incredulous at the government's arguments. She directed a barrage of often sarcastic questions at Richard Lawson, a Justice Department lawyer, brushing aside some of his positions as "hyper-technical legal arguments that may have no merit." On the docket, meanwhile, the administration is outgunned. The firms suing the government are working with legal heavyweights. Perkins Coie picked Williams & Connolly; Cooley LLP is representing Jenner & Block; Paul Clement is representing WilmerHale; and Susman Godfrey hired Munger Tolles. "You're a bit outmanned here," a judge quipped at Lawson when he showed up alone to a hearing in Susman Godfrey's case earlier this month. Inside the decision to fight back. In a memo to staff, Karp justified Paul Weiss' move to cut a deal with Trump by saying that leadership had "incredibly difficult decisions" to make. For Susman Godfrey, the way forward was clear. No one at the firm spoke with the White House about cutting a deal, according to two people familiar with the matter. BI's Jack Newsham and Jacob Shamsian have exclusive reporting about how Susman Godfrey decided to sue the Trump administration in just two hours. 1. Ross Gerber's not feeling too hot about Tesla. Though investors cheered Elon Musk's impending DOGE departure, Ross Gerber told BI he's even "more disturbed" after its earnings call. Even with Musk back at the helm, Gerber doubts the EV maker can mount a comeback. 2. America is dangerously close to the worst kind of recession. The country's on the verge of stagflation, a condition in which inflation is taking off at the same time as the job market is getting weaker. It's a rock-and-a-hard place situation for the Fed, and leaves investors in a pickle. 3. There are also signs, however, that investors might be able to take a breath. The stock market has flashed a handful of technical signals that suggest the tariff-induced sell-off that kicked off earlier this month may be over. 1. Microsoft cleans up its AI sales pitch. The software giant is trying to streamline how it pitches its many different AI tools — which are all called Copilot — to customers, according to internal presentation slides viewed by BI. The current approach confused customers and slowed sales, insiders said. 2. The manpower driving Tesla's robotaxi launch. The EV maker aims to roll out robotaxis in Austin this June. To prepare, about 300 test operators have been navigating the city's streets over the past few months. Here's what insiders had to say on "Project Rodeo." 3. Everybody talks (too much). Group chat overload has produced a new-old solution: the rise of voice memos. It's part of a broader trend toward speaking over texting for more personal communication. Not everyone's thrilled, though — especially when the calls happen in public. 1. Price hikes are hitting your favorite Amazon products. Some of the site's most popular items are getting pricier amid tariff news, according to data from SmartScout. Some products have even reached record highs, and it's not just an issue for customers. 2. Uber's CEO says your ride could cost less in a recession. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing service is "recession-resistant" and could even make rides cheaper in a downturn — if more people sign up to be drivers, bringing labor costs down. 3. What do Delta, Thermo Fisher, and Chipotle have in common? They are among the companies lowering or ditching their guidance as tariff chaos mounts. Here's the full list of companies on edge.

U.S. stocks were on track for a flat to slightly lower open Monday as investors geared up for a jam-packed week of earnings spanning pizza chains, semiconductor makers, and sanitation giants. Here are the stocks likely to dominate today’s headlines: Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificial intelligence chip designed to challenge some of Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) top offerings, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Ascend 910D represents a major step in China’s push to build a self-sufficient tech industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia shares fell about 1.5% in premarket trading following the report. Domino’s beat earnings expectations but missed on revenue, posting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. CEO Russell Weiner said the company is staying focused on “controlling what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” while celebrating early progress under its “Hungry for MORE” five-year plan. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5%, while international same-store sales rose 3.7% excluding currency impacts. Domino’s stock slipped roughly 2% before the bell. Waste Management (WM+1.00%) will report after the close, with investors zeroing in on margin trends and pricing power. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-0.15%) is expected to offer an early read on global chip demand, where a year-over-year earnings decline is projected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS-1.80%) could provide a key window into how much R&D spending chipmakers are sustaining in a tighter environment. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V-0.28%), Coca-Cola (KO-0.01%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+2.44%), and Novartis (NVS-0.56%). Later in the week, Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) and Meta (META-2.36%) are set to headline earnings after the bell Wednesday, offering critical updates on cloud growth, AI momentum, and digital advertising trends. Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) and Apple (AAPL-0.39%) follow on Thursday, with Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A-0.82%) closing out the week on Friday — wrapping up one of the busiest earnings stretches of the year. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies’ leadership mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism falling to its lowest ratio since 2008. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Scrapling - An Undetectable, Powerful, Flexible, High-Performance Python Library That Makes Web Scraping Simple And Easy Again!

KitPloit - leading source of Security Tools, Hacking Tools, CyberSecurity and Network Security ☣ Dealing with failing web scrapers due to anti-bot protections or website changes? Meet Scrapling. Scrapling is a high-performance, intelligent web scraping library for Python that automatically adapts to website changes while significantly outperforming popular alternatives. For both beginners and experts, Scrapling provides powerful features while maintaining simplicity. To keep it simple, all methods can be chained on top of each other! Scrapling isn't just powerful - it's also blazing fast. Scrapling implements many best practices, design patterns, and numerous optimizations to save fractions of seconds. All of that while focusing exclusively on parsing HTML documents. Here are benchmarks comparing Scrapling to popular Python libraries in two tests. As you see, Scrapling is on par with Scrapy and slightly faster than Lxml which both libraries are built on top of. These are the closest results to Scrapling. PyQuery is also built on top of Lxml but still, Scrapling is 4 times faster. Scrapling can find elements with more methods and it returns full element Adaptor objects not only the text like AutoScraper. So, to make this test fair, both libraries will extract an element with text, find similar elements, and then extract the text content for all of them. As you see, Scrapling is still 4.5 times faster at the same task. All benchmarks' results are an average of 100 runs. See our benchmarks.py for methodology and to run your comparisons. Scrapling is a breeze to get started with; Starting from version 0.2.9, we require at least Python 3.9 to work. Then run this command to install browsers' dependencies needed to use Fetcher classes If you have any installation issues, please open an issue. Fetchers are interfaces built on top of other libraries with added features that do requests or fetch pages for you in a single request fashion and then return an Adaptor object. This feature was introduced because the only option we had before was to fetch the page as you wanted it, then pass it manually to the Adaptor class to create an Adaptor instance and start playing around with the page. You might be slightly confused by now so let me clear things up. All fetcher-type classes are imported in the same way All of them can take these initialization arguments: auto_match, huge_tree, keep_comments, keep_cdata, storage, and storage_args, which are the same ones you give to the Adaptor class. If you don't want to pass arguments to the generated Adaptor object and want to use the default values, you can use this import instead for cleaner code: then use it right away without initializing like: Also, the Response object returned from all fetchers is the same as the Adaptor object except it has these added attributes: status, reason, cookies, headers, history, and request_headers. All cookies, headers, and request_headers are always of type dictionary. [!NOTE] The auto_match argument is enabled by default which is the one you should care about the most as you will see later. This class is built on top of httpx with additional configuration options, here you can do GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. For all methods, you have stealthy_headers which makes Fetcher create and use real browser's headers then create a referer header as if this request came from Google's search of this URL's domain. It's enabled by default. You can also set the number of retries with the argument retries for all methods and this will make httpx retry requests if it failed for any reason. The default number of retries for all Fetcher methods is 3. Hence: All headers generated by stealthy_headers argument can be overwritten by you through the headers argument You can route all traffic (HTTP and HTTPS) to a proxy for any of these methods in this format http://username:password@localhost:8030 For Async requests, you will just replace the import like below: This class is built on top of Camoufox, bypassing most anti-bot protections by default. Scrapling adds extra layers of flavors and configurations to increase performance and undetectability even further. Note: all requests done by this fetcher are waiting by default for all JS to be fully loaded and executed so you don't have to :) This list isn't final so expect a lot more additions and flexibility to be added in the next versions! This class is built on top of Playwright which currently provides 4 main run options but they can be mixed as you want. Note: all requests done by this fetcher are waiting by default for all JS to be fully loaded and executed so you don't have to :) Using this Fetcher class, you can make requests with: 1) Vanilla Playwright without any modifications other than the ones you chose. 2) Stealthy Playwright with the stealth mode I wrote for it. It's still a WIP but it bypasses many online tests like Sannysoft's. Some of the things this fetcher's stealth mode does include: * Patching the CDP runtime fingerprint. * Mimics some of the real browsers' properties by injecting several JS files and using custom options. * Using custom flags on launch to hide Playwright even more and make it faster. * Generates real browser's headers of the same type and same user OS then append it to the request's headers. 3) Real browsers by passing the real_chrome argument or the CDP URL of your browser to be controlled by the Fetcher and most of the options can be enabled on it. 4) NSTBrowser's docker browserless option by passing the CDP URL and enabling nstbrowser_mode option. Hence using the real_chrome argument requires that you have Chrome browser installed on your device Add that to a lot of controlling/hiding options as you will see in the arguments list below. This list isn't final so expect a lot more additions and flexibility to be added in the next versions! If your case needs more than the element's parent, you can iterate over the whole ancestors' tree of any element like below You can search for a specific ancestor of an element that satisfies a function, all you need to do is to pass a function that takes an Adaptor object as an argument and return True if the condition satisfies or False otherwise like below: You can select elements by their text content in multiple ways, here's a full example on another website: Find all elements that are similar to the current element in location and attributes To increase the complexity a little bit, let's say we want to get all books' data using that element as a starting point for some reason The documentation will provide more advanced examples. Let's say you are scraping a page with a structure like this: And you want to scrape the first product, the one with the p1 ID. You will probably write a selector like this When website owners implement structural changes like The selector will no longer function and your code needs maintenance. That's where Scrapling's auto-matching feature comes into play. How does the auto-matching work? Check the FAQs section for that and other possible issues while auto-matching. Let's use a real website as an example and use one of the fetchers to fetch its source. To do this we need to find a website that will change its design/structure soon, take a copy of its source then wait for the website to make the change. Of course, that's nearly impossible to know unless I know the website's owner but that will make it a staged test haha. To solve this issue, I will use The Web Archive's Wayback Machine. Here is a copy of StackOverFlow's website in 2010, pretty old huh?Let's test if the automatch feature can extract the same button in the old design from 2010 and the current design using the same selector :) If I want to extract the Questions button from the old design I can use a selector like this #hmenus > div:nth-child(1) > ul > li:nth-child(1) > a This selector is too specific because it was generated by Google Chrome. Now let's test the same selector in both versions Note that I used a new argument called automatch_domain, this is because for Scrapling these are two different URLs, not the website so it isolates their data. To tell Scrapling they are the same website, we then pass the domain we want to use for saving auto-match data for them both so Scrapling doesn't isolate them. In a real-world scenario, the code will be the same except it will use the same URL for both requests so you won't need to use the automatch_domain argument. This is the closest example I can give to real-world cases so I hope it didn't confuse you :) Notes: 1. For the two examples above I used one time the Adaptor class and the second time the Fetcher class just to show you that you can create the Adaptor object by yourself if you have the source or fetch the source using any Fetcher class then it will create the Adaptor object for you. 2. Passing the auto_save argument with the auto_match argument set to False while initializing the Adaptor/Fetcher object will only result in ignoring the auto_save argument value and the following warning message text Argument `auto_save` will be ignored because `auto_match` wasn't enabled on initialization. Check docs for more info. This behavior is purely for performance reasons so the database gets created/connected only when you are planning to use the auto-matching features. Same case with the auto_match argument. Inspired by BeautifulSoup's find_all function you can find elements by using find_all/find methods. Both methods can take multiple types of filters and return all elements in the pages that all these filters apply to. So the way it works is after collecting all passed arguments and keywords, each filter passes its results to the following filter in a waterfall-like filtering system. It filters all elements in the current page/element in the following order: Note: The filtering process always starts from the first filter it finds in the filtering order above so if no tag name(s) are passed but attributes are passed, the process starts from that layer and so on. But the order in which you pass the arguments doesn't matter. Examples to clear any confusion :) Here's what else you can do with Scrapling: Saving and retrieving elements manually to auto-match them outside the css and the xpath methods but you have to set the identifier by yourself. To save an element to the database: python >>> element = page.find_by_text('Tipping the Velvet', first_match=True) >>> page.save(element, 'my_special_element') if you want to keep it as lxml.etree object, leave the adaptor_type argument python >>> page.relocate(element_dict) [<Element a at 0x105a2a7b0>] Filtering results based on a function Doing operations on element content is the same as scrapy python quote.re(r'regex_pattern') # Get all strings (TextHandlers) that match the regex pattern quote.re_first(r'regex_pattern') # Get the first string (TextHandler) only quote.json() # If the content text is jsonable, then convert it to json using `orjson` which is 10x faster than the standard json library and provides more options except that you can do more with them like python quote.re( r'regex_pattern', replace_entities=True, # Character entity references are replaced by their corresponding character clean_match=True, # This will ignore all whitespaces and consecutive spaces while matching case_sensitive= False, # Set the regex to ignore letters case while compiling it ) Hence all of these methods are methods from the TextHandler within that contains the text content so the same can be done directly if you call the .text property or equivalent selector function. Doing operations on the text content itself includes Sort all characters in the string as if it were a list and return the new string python quote.sort(reverse=False) To be clear, TextHandler is a sub-class of Python's str so all normal operations/methods that work with Python strings will work with it. Any element's attributes are not exactly a dictionary but a sub-class of mapping called AttributesHandler that's read-only so it's faster and string values returned are actually TextHandler objects so all operations above can be done on them, standard dictionary operations that don't modify the data, and more :) Scrapling is under active development so expect many more features coming soon :) There are a lot of deep details skipped here to make this as short as possible so to take a deep dive, head to the docs section. I will try to keep it updated as possible and add complex examples. There I will explain points like how to write your storage system, write spiders that don't depend on selectors at all, and more... Note that implementing your storage system can be complex as there are some strict rules such as inheriting from the same abstract class, following the singleton design pattern used in other classes, and more. So make sure to read the docs first. [!IMPORTANT] A website is needed to provide detailed library documentation. I'm trying to rush creating the website, researching new ideas, and adding more features/tests/benchmarks but time is tight with too many spinning plates between work, personal life, and working on Scrapling. I have been working on Scrapling for months for free after all. If you like Scrapling and want it to keep improving then this is a friendly reminder that you can help by supporting me through the sponsor button. This section addresses common questions about Scrapling, please read this section before opening an issue. Now because everything about the element can be changed or removed, nothing from the element can be used as a unique identifier for the database. To solve this issue, I made the storage system rely on two things: Together both are used to retrieve the element's unique properties from the database later. 4. Now later when you enable the auto_match parameter for both the Adaptor instance and the method call. The element properties are retrieved and Scrapling loops over all elements in the page and compares each one's unique properties to the unique properties we already have for this element and a score is calculated for each one. 5. Comparing elements is not exact but more about finding how similar these values are, so everything is taken into consideration, even the values' order, like the order in which the element class names were written before and the order in which the same element class names are written now. 6. The score for each element is stored in the table, and the element(s) with the highest combined similarity scores are returned. Not a big problem as it depends on your usage. The word default will be used in place of the URL field while saving the element's unique properties. So this will only be an issue if you used the same identifier later for a different website that you didn't pass the URL parameter while initializing it as well. The save process will overwrite the previous data and auto-matching uses the latest saved properties only. For each element, Scrapling will extract: - Element tag name, text, attributes (names and values), siblings (tag names only), and path (tag names only). - Element's parent tag name, attributes (names and values), and text. That's because passing the auto_save/auto_match argument without setting auto_match to True while initializing the Adaptor object will only result in ignoring the auto_save/auto_match argument value. This behavior is purely for performance reasons so the database gets created only when you are planning to use the auto-matching features. It could be one of these reasons: 1. No data were saved/stored for this element before. 2. The selector passed is not the one used while storing element data. The solution is simple - Pass the old selector again as an identifier to the method called. - Retrieve the element with the retrieve method using the old selector as identifier then save it again with the save method and the new selector as identifier. - Start using the identifier argument more often if you are planning to use every new selector from now on. 3. The website had some extreme structural changes like a new full design. If this happens a lot with this website, the solution would be to make your code as selector-free as possible using Scrapling features. Pretty much yeah, almost all features you get from BeautifulSoup can be found or achieved in Scrapling one way or another. In fact, if you see there's a feature in bs4 that is missing in Scrapling, please make a feature request from the issues tab to let me know. Of course, you can find elements by text/regex, find similar elements in a more reliable way than AutoScraper, and finally save/retrieve elements manually to use later as the model feature in AutoScraper. I have pulled all top articles about AutoScraper from Google and tested Scrapling against examples in them. In all examples, Scrapling got the same results as AutoScraper in much less time. Yes, Scrapling instances are thread-safe. Each Adaptor instance maintains its state. Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Scrapling. There is a lot to do!

Title: Tariff chaos brews as Big Tech earnings loom

U.S. stocks were a mixed bag Monday as investors followed earnings across sectors, from pizza to semiconductors and sanitation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 114 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 gained almost 4 points, or about 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished down 17 points, or 0.1%. All three were up during morning trading before falling throughout the afternoon and finishing close to even. Treasury Secretary Bessent made the rounds on television over the weekend, trying to project optimism that a path forward on tariffs could still emerge, especially regarding trade deals with nations across Asia. His remarks came as the U.S. moves deeper into a 90-day tariff pause — now about 20% complete — and economic damage is already mounting. U.S. farmers warn that the agriculture sector is in a “full-blown crisis,” according to CNBC, with mass cancellations of pork, hay, lumber, and other exports to China driving deep financial losses and layoffs across the industry. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism hitting its lowest ratio since 2008. Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificialintelligence chip aimed at replacing some high-end Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) products. The Ascend 910D processor represents a fresh push by China’s tech sector to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia dropped as much as 4% in Monday trading before finishing the day down almost 2.1%. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ-0.99%) missed expectations on revenue but topped earnings forecasts, reporting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. Domino’s CEO Russell Weiner highlighted the company’s ability to “control what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” and boasted about progress under the chain’s “Hungry for MORE” five-year growth initiative. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5% for the quarter, while international same-store sales rose 3.7%, excluding currency impacts. Global net store count fell by 8, reflecting 17 net openings in the U.S. and 25 net closures internationally. Domino’s stock finished the day up about 0.6%. Waste Management (WM+1.00%) reports earnings after the bell, with analysts scrutinizing margins and pricing power amid inflationary pressures. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-0.15%) will offer an early glimpse into global chip demand, with a year-over-year earnings drop expected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS-1.80%) results could provide insight into how much R&D spending chipmakers are still willing to do in a tighter environment. On the real estate side, Welltower (WELL-0.70%) will test investor appetite for healthcare REITs in a high-rate environment. Roper Technologies (ROP-0.42%) rounds out the day’s lineup, with investors watching for signs of steady growth and M&A potential in the industrial software space. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V-0.28%), Coca-Cola (KO-0.01%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+2.44%), and Novartis (NVS-0.56%).

Title: Tariff chaos brews as Big Tech earnings loom

U.S. stocks were a mixed bag Monday as investors followed earnings across sectors, from pizza to semiconductors and sanitation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 114 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 gained almost 4 points, or about 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished down 17 points, or 0.1%. All three were up during morning trading before falling throughout the afternoon and finishing close to even. Treasury Secretary Bessent made the rounds on television over the weekend, trying to project optimism that a path forward on tariffs could still emerge, especially regarding trade deals with nations across Asia. His remarks came as the U.S. moves deeper into a 90-day tariff pause — now about 20% complete — and economic damage is already mounting. U.S. farmers warn that the agriculture sector is in a “full-blown crisis,” according to CNBC, with mass cancellations of pork, hay, lumber, and other exports to China driving deep financial losses and layoffs across the industry. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism hitting its lowest ratio since 2008. Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificialintelligence chip aimed at replacing some high-end Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) products. The Ascend 910D processor represents a fresh push by China’s tech sector to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia dropped as much as 4% in Monday trading before finishing the day down almost 2.1%. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ-0.99%) missed expectations on revenue but topped earnings forecasts, reporting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. Domino’s CEO Russell Weiner highlighted the company’s ability to “control what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” and boasted about progress under the chain’s “Hungry for MORE” five-year growth initiative. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5% for the quarter, while international same-store sales rose 3.7%, excluding currency impacts. Global net store count fell by 8, reflecting 17 net openings in the U.S. and 25 net closures internationally. Domino’s stock finished the day up about 0.6%. Waste Management (WM+1.00%) reports earnings after the bell, with analysts scrutinizing margins and pricing power amid inflationary pressures. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-0.15%) will offer an early glimpse into global chip demand, with a year-over-year earnings drop expected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS-1.80%) results could provide insight into how much R&D spending chipmakers are still willing to do in a tighter environment. On the real estate side, Welltower (WELL-0.70%) will test investor appetite for healthcare REITs in a high-rate environment. Roper Technologies (ROP-0.42%) rounds out the day’s lineup, with investors watching for signs of steady growth and M&A potential in the industrial software space. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V-0.28%), Coca-Cola (KO-0.01%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+2.44%), and Novartis (NVS-0.56%). Visa is expected to post about 9% revenue growth to $9.55 billion, fueled by strong payment and cross-border volumes. While earnings are projected to come in slightly ahead of last year, investors will be watching closely for any signs of weakness in the outlook — particularly as new tariffs could weigh on consumer spending and international travel.

U.S. stock futures are little changed as markets enter the week on a four-session winning streak and investors prepare for a crowded earnings calendar, including reports from Magnificent Seven firms Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META); Domino's Pizza (DPZ) shares are fall in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected U.S. same-store sales; German drug giant Merck KGaA agrees to buy U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) for nearly $4 billion; and shares of Deliveroo soar in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) makes an offer to acquire the British food delivery service. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are edging lower as investors get ready for a busy week of earnings and economic data amid a four-session winning streak for the major indexes. Nasdaq futures are down 0.1% after the tech-favored index added 6.7% last week, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also are slightly lower after gaining last week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade over $95,000. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are rising slightly. Oil futures are lower. Gold futures are little changed. More than half of the Magnificent Seven companies are scheduled to report quarterly results this week, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) all on this week's calendar. Apple's earnings on Thursday come as the iPhone maker has shed 16% of its value this year on concerns over how U.S. tariffs on China will impact the company. Also reporting on Thursday is Amazon, whose stock was recently downgraded due to its exposure to Chinese tariffs. Microsoft and Meta Platform report Wednesday, with the latter's coming as the Instagram parent faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust court case. Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are slipping about 2.5% in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue and U.S. same-store sales. The Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company's revenue of $1.11 billion was slightly lower than the consensus of analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $4.33 came in above estimates. Same-store sales among Domino's U.S. locations fell by 0.5% year-over-year, worse than the 0.22% bump analysts had forecast. Shares of U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) are rising more than 3% in premarket trading after German drug company Merck KGaA said it has struck a deal to buy the firm for around $3.9 billion. Merck said it would offer $47 a share in cash for the Stamford, Conn.-based firm. That represents a 26% premium to SpringWorks' 20-day volume-weighted average price of $37.38 on Feb. 7—the day before speculation of a potential deal between the two started, Merck said. SpringWorks shares closed at $44.72 on Friday. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Deliveroo shares are jumping 17% in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) offered to buy the British food delivery firm for 180 pence ($2.40) per share. Deliveroo, which said it had received an "indicative proposal" from DoorDash on April 5, added its board indicated to the U.S. company that "should a firm offer be made" at those terms, it "would be minded to recommend such an offer to Deliveroo shareholders." Shares of DoorDash are little changed in premarket trading.

Title: ‘It’s Imminent’—U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Braces Bitcoin For A BlackRock ‘Megaforce’ Price Shock

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/28 update below. This post was originally published on April 27 Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as Binance’s chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has grappling with the end of a "higher for longer" U.S. dollar ... More amid predictions of a bitcoin price boom. “The preconditions are now in place for the beginning of a major dollar downtrend,” Deutsche Bank analysts George Saravelos and Tim Baker wrote seen by MarketWatch in a note, pointing to a huge shift in U.S. trade policy and a global reassessment of U.S. geopolitical leadership and predicting the end of a “higher for longer” dollar. The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell’s relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates. “Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, "in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high." The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs’ head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar’s weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump. 04/28 update: The bitcoin price has climbed over $95,000 per bitcoin as traders bet the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off is over, cheering data that showed investors poured $3.4 billion into crypto investment products, including the fleet of U.S. bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, last week— the third-largest on record—according to asset manager CoinShares. "We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven," CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a report. The bitcoin price rally over the last week, adding 20% to bitcoin from its April low, has emboldened crypto bulls who are now predicting a new bitcoin price all-time high over $110,000 is “imminent.” “Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. “Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales’ (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We expect these supportive factors to push bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $120,000 in the second quarter. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.” Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades." "Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks. "Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. "The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged this week as traders bet on a recovery of so-called risk assets and ... More fears swirl over the future of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs: Grayscale’s GBTC is dominating this front – How?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-why-grayscales-gbtc-dominates-on-this-front/
Time Published: 2025-04-28T11:00:20Z

Grayscale’s GBTC tops Bitcoin ETF annual earnings at $268M despite 70% decline in AUM. Despite being the most expensive, Grayscale Bitcoin [BTC] Trust ETF (GBTC) has outpaced the total revenue collected by the rest of the U.S. spot BTC ETFs. In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Nate Geraci of ETF Store highlighted that GBTC had an implied revenue of $268 million, compared to $211 million from combined collections by the other 11 products. “Nearly 16 months after spot BTC ETFs launched, GBTC still making more $$$ than all of the other ETFs combined…And it’s not even close.” Source: X After the debut in January 2024, Grayscale’s GBTC saw the heaviest outflows on what analysts linked to investor flight to cheaper alternatives like BlackRock’s iShares BTC ETF. Source: Coinglass Before the debut, GBTC held about 619,000 BTC. Sixteen months later, the GBTC’s holdings dropped to 191,000 BTC, a nearly 70% decline in assets under management (AUM). As shown by Geraci’s data, GBTC charged the highest fees of 1.5% while the rest of the products had an average cost of 0.15%-0.94%. Yet GBTC dominated the overall annual revenue. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, GBTC’s 1.5% fee was considered average in the traditional ETF market. However, other analysts pointed out that most investors were captured in GBTC due to the heavy tax implications of switching to a cheaper alternative. Daniel Sempere, a business coach, stated, “Paying the capital gains to switch out of GBTC is more painful than paying the extra fees, I guess.” Simply put, the high fees and captive tax implications boosted GBTC earnings. However, can the expected approval of in-kind redemption for ETFs affect GBTC’s moat? According to experts, in-kind redemption, using BTC instead of cash, would lower the tax burden, especially for large investors. Despite in-kind redemption being tax-efficient, individual investors sitting on massive unrealized gains will still face capital gains tax. That said, GBTC ranked third on the AUM front with $17.8 billion. The BlackRock iShares BTC ETF topped the AUM list with $54.8 billion, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $18 billion. After the slump in Q1 2025, the spot BTC ETFs saw renewed demand in April, with a whopping $3 billion in inflows. This boosted BTC’s recovery to $94k, up 26% from the year’s low of $74.5k. In the short term, the $92K range low support and $100K overhead mid-range resistance were key levels to watch.

Title: The Case for Higher-Ed “Co-Op” Programs

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/28/2025 3:31:01 AM PDT by karpov Like many students, I waited months after graduation before receiving a job offer. Why this delay for many of the nation’s recent graduates? The answer, in part, is that most “entry-level” positions now require candidates to have one to three years of experience. In fact, roughly 61 percent of entry-level job postings now demand at least three years. How is a fresh graduate supposed to gain experience without years-long internships, which many students don’t pursue? A potential solution to this problem is for universities to adopt the “co-op” or cooperative model, in which students alternate between working for a company and attending classes. Through the co-op model, students are given the opportunity to spend some semesters working for a company and others in class. A student applies to a co-op program at a large, respected corporation, such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, Exelon, Comcast, and others, and then interviews as if he or she were applying for a real job or internship. Once accepted, he or she begins working at that company at a predetermined time in the academic year. This model not only provides students with valuable work experience before graduation, but it also helps them build a network of professional contacts who can help them find future opportunities. Let’s consider two of the schools in the top 100 according to U.S. News: Drexel University in Philadelphia, ranked 86th overall, and North Carolina State University, ranked 58th. As of this writing, Drexel, at which more than 94 percent of undergraduates participate in a co-op program, places 97 percent of its business students in jobs (or graduate school) within the first year after graduation. Sixty-one percent of all graduates have at least one job offer upon graduation. (Excerpt) Read more at jamesgmartin.center ...

A potential solution to this problem is for universities to adopt the “co-op” or cooperative model, in which students alternate between working for a company and attending classes. Through the co-op model, students are given the opportunity to spend some semesters working for a company and others in class. A student applies to a co-op program at a large, respected corporation, such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, Exelon, Comcast, and others, and then interviews as if he or she were applying for a real job or internship. Once accepted, he or she begins working at that company at a predetermined time in the academic year. This model not only provides students with valuable work experience before graduation, but it also helps them build a network of professional contacts who can help them find future opportunities. Let’s consider two of the schools in the top 100 according to U.S. News: Drexel University in Philadelphia, ranked 86th overall, and North Carolina State University, ranked 58th. As of this writing, Drexel, at which more than 94 percent of undergraduates participate in a co-op program, places 97 percent of its business students in jobs (or graduate school) within the first year after graduation. Sixty-one percent of all graduates have at least one job offer upon graduation. (Excerpt) Read more at jamesgmartin.center ...

I graduated in 1985. I didn’t go through a co-op program, but I was fortunate enough to get a part-time job as a field technician in my industry while I was still an undergraduate. Within two months my employer convinced me to work on a nearly full-time basis and finish school in the evening program. It took me 6+ years to finish my undergraduate degree, but it was absolutely worth it. A month after I graduated, I had one of my former classmates — who graduated on the same day as me — working for me. BME, cooperative plan here. Worked 6 quarters, which was required to get a co-op plan degree. Worked in the industry of my coop job for about 15 years. I’d require colleges to co-sign student loan guaranties. Vo-Tec makes a comeback.....who do they want to pay the companies to allow students desk space? My ex and I did co-ops back in the 1980s with IBM. It was a good program ... both sides got to evaluate each other. They grabbed him right after he graduated. Co-ops and internships work fine for STEM disciplines, but I don’t see how they’re going to work for “grievance studies” degrees. Concur.... it was SOP back in the 80’s and 90’s at many technical colleges. Sadly, many administration’s are too busy chasing benji’s and don’t give two shiite’s about student success. My son graduated as an Astronautical Engineer from a small private engineering college. While not a co-op, he had a job in his field at NASA for two years while a student. (Very well compensated) The school also has a 90 day employment in your field at a competitive wage guarantee (they never have to pay it) Co-ops are a great idea... but only if the university can guarantee a spot for every student. Otherwise, the co-op program should be optional. Co-ops are similar to internships, and I have personal knowledge of what’s happening now with internships: People thought college students should graduate with experience. So, many universities (maybe all of them?) now require all students to complete an internship before they can graduate. The problem is, the universities don’t place the students. It’s up to the students to find the internship, and it must be one approved by the university. As a result, some students are being denied degrees, even after they finished all their course work, because they can’t find an internship that’s acceptable to the college and will hire them. Bad College, If they make a requirement for graduation, they should support that requirement. Here’s your car sir, you’ll have to arrange for the tire store to put wheels on it. Your car-wheel analogy is perfect. But the reality is even worse: Only internships in the fall or spring semesters count. Not summer internships. So, if you’re supposed to graduate in the spring, but you still haven’t found an internship, you have to wait until the fall for an internship. And you have to pay the college fall tuition for the internship you found yourself. So, it’s like, “Here’s your car. In six months, it’s all yours... after you pay us for the wheels you found yourself.” Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Advertisement April 28, 2025 | 14 min read Listen to article 4 min Andrew Tindall started his marketing career with seven years in the commercial and marketing teams at Bacardi, Innocent, Brown-Forman, and Diageo. Now working in global marketing effectiveness, he reckons the drinks trade has lost its way. A still from I'd like to buy the world a Coke, where they are holding Guinness instead My marketing career began in the drinks business where I developed three bad habits: I’m a sugary juice fiend, I spend far too much time in the pub, and worst of all, I became a certified drink-marketing-wanker (DMW). We are all one or two friends removed from a DMW. You just have to learn how to spot them: All their friends work in booze marketing or behind bars. They constantly outdo each other’s cool new “hidden” bar, like a liquid cultural capital dick-measuring contest. They have WhatsApp groups to debate ad launches, innovation flops, and gossip about people moves like they actually matter to anyone outside Soho. It is the category-navel-gazing that completely screws a DMW’s objectivity so much so that they start thinking a new hard seltzer or gin launch is genuinely culturally significant. However, good DMWs recognize this and rely on customer data to make decisions instead of just pleasing their mates. I’m now three years DMW clean, having left drinks marketing to work in marketing effectiveness. Sure, I still occasionally swirl a mezcal negroni while chortling at the latest celebrity acquisition, but mostly, I’m out. After working across different categories and markets, I can confidently confirm that the drinks category isn’t what it was. I don’t take any joy in writing this. Ignore what that CSO wrote about me on the back of the toilet cubicle door at the Groucho Club; I always try to keep things positive. Yes, there are some brilliant exceptions, but we must wake up and smell the sambuca. The industry that once produced the best marketers has fallen off the wagon. Marketing has failed big-booze. Big-booze stock prices are drunkenly falling. The top houses are all more than 30% down; one is literally down 79%. Listening to industry folk trying to explain this decline quickly sorts them into four camps: The Lifer: This person holds a golden DMW card, is an expert at boardroom politics and has survived 10+ restructures. They’ll always cite “macroeconomic factors.” The Marketing Non-Believer: Considers marketing a cost and (quite rightly) points out how hard procurement teams have dropped the ball. A good example is the tequila mess, where no one could get enough agave, and now there’s a massive oversupply. Whisky planners forecasting 20 years of barrel aging into the future must be howling. The Clueless: Always the loudest. They claim culture has changed (alcohol has become less relevant), people are trading down to cheaper brands, and revenues are slumping as people leave the category for alternatives. The Minority: Understands marketing’s role, so cringes at The Clueless. Knows proper marketing keeps brands in culture, grows categories through penetration, and allows you to charge a premium. You can usually work out which group someone falls into by asking them why the Coca-Cola share price remains impervious to decline and gets Warren Buffett out of bed in the morning. Not every drink brand and business is guilty, obviously, but it’s worth pondering a few key issues. Advertisement Many spirits ads are incredibly “left-brained.” In Orlando Wood’s seminal work, the IPA books ‘Lemon’ and ‘Look out’, he showed that brands must put on a show with “right-brained” creative features to capture attention and elicit emotion from non-buyers. He was forced to name some “left brain” creative features to prove the point with data. You’ll see a lot of spirits clearly use a lot of these: vacant stares, fast cut scenes, overt voiceovers, abstracted body parts and rational product features. This style of work only speaks to the already aware and interested, and struggles to recruit lighter buyers. Elite-DMW Nick Williamson researched over 200 global booze ads and proved this in his drinks ad how-to guide: Raising The Bar. (Reach out if you want to see that.) Beyond the dependency on rational thinking, many ads from big-booze brands look, smell, and taste the same, be it grading, studios, music, sets, lens flare, and the ever-present Gen Z-esque cast. Honestly, go pick a big-booze business. Watch the latest ads from its various brands. The similarities are uncanny and hilarious. Is this procurement having too much sway? Brand managers rotating between brands? Refusal to hire non-drink marketers? I am not sure the agencies are blame-free here either. I once launched a paid Meta campaign for a whisky brand, a competitor launched something similar on Meta the week after and I shit you not: they’d picked the same music and used the same studio. Also, innovation has been replaced with chasing incremental flavors and slimming down glass bottles at the expense of distinctiveness. Or launching global travel retail “exclusives” that eventually fail and end up in the staff shop. You hear horror stories as stock prices get spicy and trousers get soiled. “We must focus on the core.” I agree; get back to brand building, not incremental flavor BS, while we wind back investment in anything that will pay back in 5+ years. Incubation and brand accelerator budgets have been slashed. And the biggest crime of all: no one has managed to arrest the endless discounting. Some of your favorite spirit brands are sold on offer in grocery 95%+ of the time. I understand grocers need their pound of flesh. I understand shelf space, joint business plans, and how you get activation space. But if you pulled that at a P&G or Unilever brand, the CMO would personally come and drag you from your desk to the front door, no matter how many times you say “revenue growth management”. Saving the largest discounts for Christmas as well is like a florist doing a deal on roses for Valentine’s Day. When did you last buy a case of beer or a bottle of spirit at full price? As one of my DMW mentors always laughs, “Why charge for it when you can give it away?” It’s hard not to rant like this when you care about the industry and brands. And you see friends losing jobs, unable to find new ones. Marketing’s role in society is to turn the wheels of commerce. It’s noble. Without exposing myself as a card-carrying capitalist too much. What really prompted me to bother writing this was re-listening to Tito’s CMO (Taylor Berry) on The CMO podcast. A rare podcast episode that I’ve found myself diving back into multiple times over the past few years. This guy really gets it. It only has six product lines (SKUs). I’ve worked on tiny, tiny brands with hundreds. Tito’s refused to jump on trends but focused on driving its brand power. It found an emotional brand platform and stuck with it over the years while still keeping it creative and interesting. This got me thinking about the green shoots we see in the industry from people who clearly get it, green shoots of marketing hope. There’s the obvious advertising and culture work coming from Guinness, maybe the less obvious, incredibly consistent ‘Do What Moves You’ Bacardi Rum campaign that gets far too little recognition for what it’s managed to do for its market share. White Claw’s creation of a global category should also be studied. The Woodsman whisky’s creation of Barry the Beaver and the results that followed, in a category determined to discuss flavor benefits, is heartwarming. 5-star work in System1’s testing and subsequent market share gobbling. Poretti’s first powerful stake in the ground with their new foxy work is also magnificent. De Kuyper’s purchase of the dormant giant Archer’s Peach Schnapps and investment in a brand refresh and new campaign to turn latent awareness into salience is poised to yield brilliant results. Honestly, Gemma Collins is exactly what this brand needs, even if the bottle refresh went a little too far. Speaking of excellent celeb use, Malibu’s new work with Brian Cox is right-brained AF. Malibu is consistently doing some interesting things to drive brand fame. It has to as rival premium coconut rums pop up left, right and centre. Cox really makes all other drinks ads (a category inherently rooted in friends, fun, and relaxation) look serious, boring, and stuffy. And AU vodka is, by some measures, the fastest growing global brand (not drink brand, brand). I can’t reference any big TV ads because it hasn’t done any. Growth has come from a genuine market orientation that birthed a garish gold bottle, a high-color high-flavor strategy (that changed the category), authentic celeb collabs, and owning where few DMWs have bothered to step foot in - a corner shop. Top-shelf vodka brands are getting shown up by a couple of mates from Swansea. But the brand that should really give us hope is the one that should be the most impressive marketing story of the past decade. Heineken’s Birra Morreti. What a champion of a brand. It's just about to overtake Peroni’s off-trade sales, off the back of the ‘Enjoy Life’s Simple Pleasures’ brand platform, which just hit the System1 database. The second highest scoring beer ad we’ve tested. Cracking work from Lucky Generals as always. It lost volume last year but managed to grow by increasing its price by 11%. You see this in about 3% of IPA case studies and 5% of WARC’s. Bloody brilliant. And its Birra Moretti Sale Di Mare (sea salt) is a great example of fluent innovation (80% familiar, 20% new). It’s not all doom and gloom. Marketers who are smashing it will raise the bar. Let’s just hope everyone gets serious and catches up before the decent ones all go and start marketing toilet roll. The minority must become the majority. Right, all this writing made me thirsty, so I went off to the pub. And not for juice. Email all your complaints about the above here.

Title: Meta Earnings Preview: What To Know About The Stock Before The Upcoming Report

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. More analysts view Meta's legal and macroeconomic risks as temporary problems vs. long-term issues. Meta Platforms (META) will report its first-quarter earnings on April 30, 2025. Prep for the report with this review of how the company is doing, what analysts expect and which data points will be most telling in the upcoming Meta stock earnings presentation. Year to date, Meta stock is down almost 9%. The stock reached its 2025 high of $740.91 on February 14, after announcing consensus-beating performance for the fourth quarter and then raising its dividend. As with other tech companies, the recent expansion of the U.S. tariff policy has taken a toll on Meta’s stock price. After U.S. President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs on April 2, Meta dipped more than 13% in two trading days. Today, the stock trades for about $547 per share. Prior to this year, Meta stock had been trending up with volatility. The stock gained 67% in 2024 and 194% in 2023 on higher revenue and earnings. Earnings growth was the headlining story in both years: Diluted EPS grew 60% in 2024 and 73% in the year prior. Key components of Meta's first-quarter earnings presentation will include updates on sales, profits, user engagement, ad prices and the company's artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. Meta has beaten analysts’ expectations for revenue and EPS for seven consecutive quarters. The company makes its money selling digital advertising across its network of apps, and demand has been strong. Earnings have benefited from cost-cutting efforts that began in 2023, a period CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the "year of efficiency." Continued strong increases in revenue and EPS demonstrate a good balance between Meta's capital-intensive growth initiatives and operational execution. Family DAP is Meta’s high-level user engagement metric. Family refers to the company's portfolio of applications: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. The DAP metric quantifies how many people log in and access a Meta app in a day. For a company that sells digital ads, family DAP is like inventory. When more people use Meta apps, there are more advertising impressions to sell. Not only that, but advertising demand and effectiveness can rise as the user base grows. This is because a larger user base provides more data and audience targeting options. Meta's family DAP has been increasing for years, but the pace of growth has fluctuated between 4.27% and 15.45% since 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2024, family DAP was 3.35 billion, about 5% higher than the prior-year period. Strength in ad prices indicates good demand. It signals that advertisers are generally happy with the value they’re getting for their ad investment. Alongside a rising inventory of ad impressions, this perception of value is critical for long-term growth. If ads don't deliver results, advertisers will spend their money elsewhere. Average ad price can be a tricky metric for digital advertisers. There are several huge players in this space—Google, Amazon, TikTok and Reddit, to name a few. Each is working to build its audience, which creates a continually expanding supply of advertising opportunities. Demand must grow also to keep advertising rates strong. In 2024, Meta increased its average ad price by 10%. Meta regularly reports what it spends on capital investments, including AI. Total capital expenditures in 2024 was $39.2 billion. CFO Susan Li said the company expects to spend a jaw-dropping $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025. AI represents Meta’s most compelling growth opportunity. The company is developing an open-source large language model called Llama. Morningstar reports that Llama is among the most cost-efficient LLMs available today. Additionally, if Meta can make further cost improvements, Llama has many interesting use cases—from generating effective, customized ad content for advertisers to reducing Meta's application development costs. Given Meta's investment in AI, investors want to see these use cases take shape as transformational and competition-busting business initiatives. Every global company faces macroeconomic risks. Three factors to watch for Meta are consumer spending, the U.S. regulatory environment and the ongoing U.S. trade war with China. A slowdown in consumer spending in the U.S. and globally lessens the return potential for digital advertising. Advertisers are likely to limit their advertising budgets in response. Should the U.S. or other major economies fall into recession, Meta would feel the impact as slowing or negative sales growth. Meta is currently defending an antitrust lawsuit brought forth by the Federal Trade Commission. The suit could require the company to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Congress is also investigating whether Meta collaborated with the Chinese government at the expense of U.S. national security. How far these cases go could define Meta's future. Some outlets report that Zuckerberg has courted President Trump to alleviate his company's legal woes. Time will tell if that strategy proves effective. Wells Fargo analysts estimate that 11% of Meta's revenue comes from China-based advertisers, as quoted by Investing.com. These revenues are at risk under President Trump's new tariff policy that imposes taxes of up to 245% on imported Chinese goods. The tariff costs can be absorbed by Chinese sellers or passed on to U.S. consumers, but either strategy likely limits advertising returns. In its last earnings presentation, Meta shared a first-quarter revenue guidance range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. According to Tradingview.com, analysts expect the company to produce $41.38 billion revenue, near the high end of the guidance. Analysts also expect EPS of $5.24. These numbers represent quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 14.4% and EPS growth of 21.3%. Out of 72 analysts, 53 rate Meta a strong buy and 10 rate the company a buy. There are also seven hold ratings, one sell rating and one strong sell rating. Price targets range from $448 to $900, averaging to $710.90, which is about 30% higher than the current Meta stock price. Meta's stock price has declined in April, but this seems more related to the ongoing U.S. tariff saga than a company-specific trend. Many stocks and the S&P 500 have followed the same trajectory. Bottom Line Things to love about Meta right now are its revenue momentum, improving efficiency and exciting AI initiatives. However, the company also has some legal trouble to manage and may face short-term headwinds related to the U.S. economy and the trade war with China. These won’t impact first-quarter results, but investors should pay close attention to leadership's commentary on these topics during the earnings webcast. So far, more analysts view the legal and macroeconomic risks as temporary problems vs. long-term issues. If that's accurate, now may be the time to scoop up Meta at a good price. Otherwise, see best stocks for 2025 for more investing ideas.

Amazon (AMZN) is expected to release first-quarter results after the closing bell on Thursday, with analysts bullish on the online retail and tech giant. All 26 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha who follow the company rate Amazon's stock as a "buy," with every analyst holding a price target above the stock's current levels. The average price target is around $241, a premium of over 30% to Wednesday's close but down from about $259 ahead of last quarter's report. Amazon is expected to report $155 billion in revenue for the first quarter, up 8% from the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise to $1.75 from $1.46 the same time last year. Amazon shares have declined about 16% since the start of the year, amid a tariff-fueled market sell-off that has hit the Magnificent Seven hard. Analysts will likely seek more information about Amazon's plans to keep up with the spending pace of its artificial intelligence rivals. But Wall Street's attention is also focused on the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote recently that they estimate 18% of products on Amazon are imported from China, and that roughly 60% of third-party sellers on the platform have "some China exposure" that could affect ad spending plans. Executives may also be asked about reports earlier this week that the company planned to show shoppers the effects of tariffs on items for purchase, which led to a stiff rebuke from the White House. The company later said it considered such a move, but only for its Amazon Haul business, and that the idea "was never approved and is not going to happen.” UPDATE—April 30, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change The Week That Was: 2025 04-26 (April 26, 2025)Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org)The Science and Environmental Policy Project Quote of the Week: “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.” — James Madison (1788) Number of the Week: Increase of 11ºF by 2100. THIS WEEK:By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with a discussion of the National Science Foundation. TWTW continues with a brief discussion of the scientific method and why the US National Climate Assessment does not meet the standards needed for its work to be considered physical science. TWTW considers the high scientific integrity of Roger Pielke, Jr. before criticizing his view that fixing the National Climate Assessment will be easy. TWTW then questions the actual physical science supporting EPA’s Endangerment Finding. It concludes with presenting three interesting articles on diverse subjects. ********************* NSF: The Nation Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that supports science and engineering in the US. Its counterpart in the medical fields is the National Institute of Health. The NSF’s enacted budget for fiscal year 2024 is $9.06 Billion. The requested 2025 budget is slightly over $10 billion. According to reports, the current request will be cut, and part of its workforce will be cut. On April 24, NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan announced that he has resigned. News reports claimed this is proof of the anti-science bias of the current administration. The April 12 TWTW discussed a significant problem in US science funding. The U.S. Global Change Research Program publishes what is considered the nation’s premier report on climate change, the National Climate Assessment (NCA), produced by the consulting firm ICF International. The report is endorsed by 15 government agencies including the National Science Foundation. However, the Fifth National Climate Assessment (2023) is a blatantly political report that omits physical evidence that contradicts its general conclusions that the current warming is unprecedented. Further it contains no physical evidence showing the relationship between increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and increasing temperatures. Yet, it uses the discredited very high emissions scenario to forecast a temperature increase of 11ºF by 2100. The Fifth National Climate Assessment is not physical science but more a follow-up piece on the highly politicized Sixth Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, particularly its Synthesis Report (March 2023). The Synthesis Report contains none of the uncertainty expressed in Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis (2021). The US National Climate Assessment should emphasize the uncertainty, not omit it. And the National Science Foundations should not be a party to such a poor report. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy, and Science, Policy, and Evidence. *************** Zero Omissions: Although its origins are far earlier, the scientific method became established during the controversy on an Earth-centered universe or a planetary system with the visible planets orbiting the sun. The great Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) insisted that only careful observation over long periods of time can resolve the controversy. In 1572, Brahe observed a new bright star (probably a super nova) that triggered doubt in the old Aristotelian belief that the universe was fixed. Brahe developed a research program with improving the instruments used to observe the planets to determine the paths. After his death his assistant, Johannes Kepler used Brahe’s data to explain that the planetary orbits were not circular but formed an ellipse with the sun as one focus and to develop Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion. This history establishes an important principle in the scientific method; no observations should be omitted. As discussed above, in the reports of the IPCC, particularly the summaries, and in the National Climate Assessment (NCA), important observations are omitted. For example, for 99.9% of Earth’s history, there was no correlation between CO2 and temperature. For the last few glacial periods, CO2 changes have come after temperature changes. Two decades of data collected for measuring the earth’s energy balance reveal that the increase in absorbed heat is primarily due to changes in the earth’s albedo. Thus, these reports are not physical science. They do not use the scientific method. Some defenders of this practice in climate “science” avoid the issue by claiming that their work is based on “first principles” or fundamental concepts or assumptions, sometimes considered self-evident. Alas, first principles tell us about the patterns of spectra of molecules such as CO2 but cannot tell us precise energy levels. Nor can first principles tell us about the probability of absorbing IR of a certain wavelength. In Quantum Mechanics, first principles can tell us about the spacings of energy levels, but not their amounts. Precise measurements are required. Such issues are omitted in the NCA. Those who argue from the standpoint of first principles are in the realm of metaphysics, thinking about physics, not in the realm of physical physics. In his 1912 book Problems of Philosophy, the logician Betrand Russell has several chapters evaluating the work of Immanuel Kant questioning “Is a priori knowledge possible?” Can we know something by pure logic alone, without experience or observations? This is a philosophical question, not one for physical science based on observations. *************** Misguided Defense of NCA: Roger Pielke, Jr., is a scientist with considerable integrity. He wrote an essay published by the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology titled “Do Not Use the ICAT Hurricane Loss ‘Dataset’: An Opportunity for Course Correction in Climate Science.” Yet Pielke helped develop this dataset. The abstract states: “A fatally flawed time series of U.S. hurricane losses assembled by an insurance company almost a decade ago has found its way into analyses published in the peer-reviewed literature. The flawed time series is based on undocumented modifications to a research-quality dataset that I and my colleagues [sic.] published almost two decades ago. The uncritical use of the time series has led to erroneous conclusions published in the peer-reviewed literature which then were repeated in important climate science assessments. This paper explains the origin of the flawed dataset and demonstrates its many biases. The errors are so obvious and consequential that papers published in the peer-reviewed literature that rely on the flawed dataset should be retracted. While mistakes happen in science, what matters more is what we in the community do when mistakes are discovered.” Recognizing his considerable integrity, TWTW takes issue with Pielke’s defense of the National Climate Assessment. In a post “Trump Comes for Climate Research: Making sense of the USGCRP and NCA” Pielke writes: “To fix the NCA would not be difficult. Three actions are needed. First, the assessment should be housed within and implemented entirely from a federal agency within the scope of the USGCRP. There should be no oversight or control exerted from the White House. Second, the report should be led and written by experts chosen by an empaneling team. This team should be selected by a bipartisan group, as is typically done for reports on highly politicized issues. For instance, the majority and minority members of the House Science Committee could each select 6 members of this empaneling committee, with two co-chairs. The empaneling committee would then identify experts to lead and contribute to the report. Third, before the writing starts, the assessment team should query decision makers — federal, state, local, in business and civil society — to identify what information they perceive to be most useful to their decisions related to climate mitigation and adaptation. These three steps would ensure that there is no perception of White House influence on the report, that it is authored by experts assembled in a bipartisan manner and that the topics that the report focuses have direct relevance to decision makers. The NCA is far too important to be politicized, and politicization is a choice. The only addition I’d make today is to explicitly recognize that any NCA should follow the guidelines of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and OMG [sic. OMB] and agency guidelines for scientific integrity and information quality. I do not expect the Trump Administration to take this (very good) advice.” To TWTW, Pielke’s recommendations ignore the most fundamental problem: the omission of physical evidence that contradicts the general conclusions. Omission of physical evidence has been a problem for years with the IPCC and the NCA, and with each iteration the problem has been getting worse. The IPCC reports on which the NCA is based have been politicized since “Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment” which Frederick Seitz asserted was the worst abuse of the peer review process he had witnessed in sixty years of American science. The National Climate Assessment is no better. The problem of omission of physical evidence is deeply ingrained, and a generation of scientists have been conditioned to accept it. The reports have become more metaphysics (thinking of physics) and propaganda than physical science. The issue is not trust in “the science” or politicalized scientists, the issue is adherence to the scientific method, a process. If physical evidence is omitted, the work is no longer physical science. Further, Pielke suggests cutting out the White House. The president is elected by the whole people, is accountable to them, and represents their interests. None of the other members of the panel he proposes are elected or accountable to all the people. There is no doubt that the influence of the White House in the past has not conformed to the principles of physical science, but then neither by and large has the pool of “experts” from which the other panel members would presumably be drawn. The only solution is to hold everyone to the principles of science and that can be done only by transparency and freedom of public comment. See links under Seeking a Common Ground. *************** Science Supporting the Endangerment Finding? The National Climate Assessment is claimed to support the EPA’s Endangerment Finding. The EPA’s press release on February 27 states [Boldface in original]: “Action On December 7, 2009, the Administrator signed two distinct findings regarding greenhouse gases under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act: These findings do not themselves impose any requirements on industry or other entities. However, this action was a prerequisite for implementing greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and other sectors.” An article in the British medical publication, the Lancet, states: “In 2009, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed the science-rooted Endangerment Finding, stating that greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations”. This finding became the cornerstone of most US climate policies and influenced many others globally.” Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis, which provides the food for all complex plant life and all animal life on Earth. Where is the physical evidence that it threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations? (Note that the dominant greenhouse gas, water vapor, is not mentioned.) The Endangerment Finding has no basis in physical science. Small corrections are not sufficient. It is wrong. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy. *************** Radiation Transfer: In developing a method for estimating the greenhouse effect in today’s atmosphere, William Van Wijngaarden and William Happer use the work of physicist Karl Schwarzschild (1873-1916). TWTW came across a 1906 essay by Schwarzschild. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer. *************** Problems In World Economic Forum? An article in the Wall Street Journal begins with: “World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab is under investigation by the organization he created after a new whistleblower letter alleged financial and ethical misconduct by the longtime leader and his wife. The anonymous letter was sent last week to the Forum’s board and raised concerns about the Forum’s governance and workplace culture, including allegations that the Schwab family mixed their personal affairs with the Forum’s resources without proper oversight, according to the letter and people familiar with the matter. It included allegations that Klaus Schwab asked junior employees to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf and used Forum funds to pay for private, in-room massages at hotels. It also alleged that his wife Hilde, a former Forum employee, scheduled “token” Forum-funded meetings in order to justify luxury holiday travel at the organization’s expense. Klaus Schwab in recent days argued against an investigation, telling board members that he denied the unsubstantiated allegations and that he would challenge them in a lawsuit, the people said. The board of trustees decided to open a probe during an emergency meeting on Easter Sunday. Schwab opted to resign immediately as the chairman, instead of staying on for an extended transition period as previously planned.” See Article # 1. *************** Wind Power, Maybe? An article in the Wall Street Journal begins with (correction by TWTW): “Germany has invested so many hundreds of billions of euros in its green energy transition over the years that no one can tally the precise amount. Yet the share of wind and solar power in the country’s energy mix in the first quarter of this year managed to fall—by a lot. There’s a lesson for the U.S. here. Renewable sources made up some 47% of electricity consumption in Europe’s largest economy in the first three months of 2024 2025 the energy trade association BDEW reported Thursday. That’s down from 56% in the first three months of 2024. The drop comes despite Germany’s continuing build-out of renewable generation. The country has added 872 wind turbines with a capacity of 4.3 gigawatts since April 2024, yet wind-power output fell 16%. Ouch. You can guess what went wrong. February and March were unusually wind-free, onshore and offshore. A lack of rain meant hydropower underperformed. March was sunnier than usual, which helped to boost solar-electricity output compared to a year earlier. But we’re talking about Germany in March. Relatively short daylight hours in a northern latitude meant this boost wasn’t enough to offset the decline in wind generation. These climactic conditions happen regularly enough that the German language has a word for it: Dunkelflaute, or ‘dark stillness.’ It means renewables alone can’t power an advanced industrial economy, as even Berlin is starting to notice.” Germany is further down the road of free energy from wind and solar than the US. Yet, many US politicians cling to the belief that wind and solar can power a modern economy, especially high-tech that requires reliable electricity. See Article # 2. *************** SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD – THE JACKSON It is time for voting on the Annual SEPP’s April Fools Award – the Jackson. The grand prize is a large lump of coal. Last year, the deserving winner of the lump of coal was the US National Science Teaching Association. In 2023, the Association banned the CO2 Coalition from its meeting which the Coalition members paid for and were approved because the CO2 Coalition exhibit pointed out that CO2 is essential for photosynthesis which is the food source of all complex life on Earth. There are many strong candidates for this dubious honor including leaders of US scientific agencies who signed off on questionable reports on climate change. Get your votes in by June 29 with the reason why you recommend that person for the award. The award will be announced at the 43rd annual meeting of the Doctors for Defensive Preparedness on July 5-6. The decision of the judges is final. *************** Increase of 11ºF by 2100. As stated above, the Fifth US National Climate Assessment asserts that under the high emissions scenario, by 2100 temperatures will be 11ºF (6ºC) warmer than today.

The 2°C (3.6℉) limit is a best estimate of the maximum temperature rise beyond which the effects of global warming are unpredictable. It is a judgement call. The IPCC’s 1.5°C (2.7℉) goal was exceeded for the first time in 2024.

The crucial line that doesn’t matter By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 23, 2025 For years we were hectored that holding the world to the Paris Agreement limit of 1.5°C of warming from “pre-industrial times”, a term alarmists use to mean “75 years after the industrial revolution” started not “before there was industry”, was critically crucial in its vital importance. But alas their rhetoric was unpersuasive, their plans were unsound or both, and they admit 1.5 is “out of reach.” So now we’re told that while it was essential it didn’t really matter whereas 2.0°C is like this time for sure man unless it’s not.

Hurricanes and Tornadoes and Wildfires By Joseph D’Aleo, ICECAP, Apr 22, 2025 http://icecap.us/index.php/go/joes-blog/updates/ Most major hurricanes evah! By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 23, 2025 The second key point is that tropical cyclone landfalls exhibit high variability. And as everybody knows who cares to, the greater the variability, the harder it is to separate noise from signal and the longer the time series you need to develop even medium confidence about a trend. Finally, the notion that major storms are surging proving a crisis and so forth is undermined by the fact that the trend for “Accumulated Cyclonic Energy” or total destructive horribleness of all storms in a year combined seems to be “flat as a pancake”. Here we go again, windstorm edition By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 16, 2025 Supposedly it’s spring, despite various local headlines of the “Arctic air will spill into Ontario with possible 15-25 cm of April snow” variety.

For instance Matthew Wielicki notes that “It’s Tornado Season Again, Again, Again… So can the dreaded CO2 add causing American tornadoes to become less destructive to its list of blessings? Well, no.

Not surprisingly, even though there is a wild price spike, farmers in Ghana are leaving the industry, smuggling crops out (because they get a better price). They didn’t plant new trees, they ran out of money for fertilizer, and didn’t try new varieties. Their children don’t want to farm cocoa, and the yields are falling on old sickly plantations.

When the Wind Didn’t Blow in Germany A years-long renewables push leaves the economy hostage to the weather. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, April 25, 2025 Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Subscribe A. van Wijngaarden and W. Happer – Using simple thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, we show that the atmosphere of a planet with suﬃciently high concentrations of greenhouse gases must develop a convecting troposphere between the surface and the tropopause altitude. Well, gee. An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection. Maybe the authors live in an alternate universe. Clueless – they are probably delusional enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to the atmosphere makes it hotter. Have people stopped thinking for themselves? Or does this sort of nonsense only occur in the USA? Nobody who contributes to WUWT, not even Michael Flynn, could possibly check the veracity of all the issues raised by this enormously convoluted and over-referenced post. What the hell is it about? I don’t understand the purpose of hosting it. Yours sincerely, Dr Bill Johnston, http://www.bomwatch.com.au ‘An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection.’ Let’s consider an atmosphere of O2 and N2 only that allows thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface to pass directly to space. Please provide a citation from a competent source that explains how such an atmosphere will convect given that it can’t dump heat to space. It would convect in the instance of a surface temperature that varied from one place to another due to day/night, for one thing, latitude, surface slope for more, and so forth. I guess the follow-up questions would be to what extent would it convect and why wouldn’t the bulk of the atmosphere effectively become isothermal after some interval of time. The good news is that qualified academics like you and vW&H can differ re. these type of questions, meaning ‘The Science’ really isn’t settled to the point that we should be recklessly messing around with how we obtain energy. I guess the follow-up questions would be to what extent would it convect and why wouldn’t the bulk of the atmosphere effectively become isothermal after some interval of time. Don’t guess. Look at Richard Feynman’s lectures, where he says “It is not an isothermal atmosphere”, and how he comes to that conclusion. Observation supports the non-isothermal nature of the atmosphere. As to “what extent”, what has that to do with anything? Are you trying to resile from your previous blanket statements? None of this nonsense is going to back up any silly idea that adding CO2 to air makes it hotter! Let’s consider an atmosphere of O2 and N2 only that allows thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface to pass directly to space. Lets’s stick to reality, if you don’t object too much. Both O2 and N2 emit and absorb infrared. Prof John Tyndall established this by experiment more than 150 years ago, and compared the absorption qualities of CO2 and H2O (for example) to dry air, purged of CO2. You can’t show me an experiment that demonstrates that your fantasy represents reality in any way. Next you’ll be telling me that adding CO2 to air makes it hotter! ‘Lets’s stick to reality..’ Yes, let’s – show me a bona fide citation that O2 and N2 absorb and emit IR, i..e., show me their emission spectrums if you have any idea what those are. Otherwise, stop being an obnoxious troll who continuously spews nonsense to the delight of climate alarmists. Frank, you probably won’t accept Penn State as “bona fide”, but here’s something from Penn State – While all matter emits radiation at all wavelengths, it does not do so equally. This is where the next radiation law comes in. Wein’s Law states that the wavelength of peak emission is inversely proportional to the temperature of the emitting object. So I’ll wait for you to find some matter which does not emit or absorb infrared radiation. I won’t hold my breath waiting. It looks like you overlooked the words “troposphere” and “tropopause” in you criticism of van Wijngaarden and Happer. The Earth’s stratosphere does not have any significant convection, thus falsifying your assertion that “An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection”. Significant atmospheric convection is precluded when an atmosphere develops warmer layers above cooler layers, which can even occur temporarily in Earth’s troposphere under the weather phenomenon known as a “temperature inversion” Now, you were saying something about clueless . . . From the paper – must develop a convecting troposphere between the surface and the tropopause altitude. Surface to tropopause. You wrote – Now, you were saying something about clueless . . . You are agreeing with me at this point? You have not managed to “falsify” anything I said. An atmosphere of any gas will demonstrate convection. You may play all the silly semantic games you wish, but the presence of “greenhouse gases” is not necessary for convection to occur. Inversions occur under a few different conditions, none of which have anything to do with so-called “greenhouse gases”, as far as I as I am aware. You might read your attachment – “suppresses convection” presupposes convection in the first place. Do you not agree? Or maybe you are claiming that inversions cannot occur without the presence of “greenhouse gases? Hopefully, you are not clueless enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to air makes it hotter! “You are agreeing with me at this point? “ No, isn’t that obvious? “An atmosphere of any gas will demonstrate convection.” (repeated claim, to be sure!) No, but I’ll make the falsification of that statement even more obvious . . . see attachment. “Inversions occur under a few different conditions, none of which have anything to do with so-called “greenhouse gases”, as far as I as I am aware.” Humidity plays a significant role in the formation and characteristics of temperature inversions. While inversions are primarily defined by temperature differences between layers, humidity levels can influence the strength and persistence of inversions, particularly near the surface. (Hint for you: humidity is a measure of the average amount of water vapor content in a given parcel of air, and water vapor is the strongest of all greenhouse gases currently present in Earth’s atmosphere.) “Hopefully, you are not clueless enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to air makes it hotter!” Adding “greenhouse gases” to a mixture of N2, O2 and Ar gases makes that mixture more capable of both absorbing and emitting LWIR radiation . . . whether or not the resulting mixture becomes “hotter” or “colder” depends on many other independent factors. As I sad, greenhouse gases have nothing to do with inversions. CO2 is denser than air, H2O is less dense. You burble that – water vapor is the strongest of all greenhouse gases currently present in Earth’s atmosphere.) Strongest? Strength compared to what, precisely? You are on the right track when you say – Adding “greenhouse gases” to a mixture of N2, O2 and Ar gases makes that mixture more capable of both absorbing and emitting LWIR radiation . . . whether or not the resulting mixture becomes “hotter” or “colder” depends on many other independent factors. Indeed. Adding so-called greenhouse gases has no quantifiable effect on temperature. By the way, your AI quote happens to mention that the Moon’s atmosphere lacks the characteristics of a “conventional dense atmosphere” – no mention of lighter H2O, or heavier CO2. Strange, that. Taking all that into account, tell what you think this mythical “greenhouse effect” is supposed to do? “It all depends”? Not much use at all, in that case. “Why Has the Daily Sceptic Been Put on Tortoise Media’s Climate Naughty List?” You do realise what Tortoise media is?

Needless to say, the car crash known as the Labour party is expected to do rather badly.. Doncaster – Miliband country “Labour’s never been for the working class – they’ve swapped. They’re not the party they were, and that’s why I like Reform. They’re the common-sense party, exactly what we want.” … “I wrote to Ed Miliband and told him about the fuel allowance.” “I got a letter off him, and he said that pensioners have never been as well off. I ripped the letter up, and said I would never vote Labour again.” … “I feel very disappointed in the Labour government,” [she says]. “I thought I’d give Labour a chance again, only to be bitterly disappointed.” “I think that for pensioners and the disabled, [Labour] are really doing a disservice to working class people who have contributed a lot to this country over the years. My trust in them has gone.” Would she contemplate voting Reform as a result? “I think Nigel Farage has some good points: what you see is what you get,” she says, admitting that “Reform or the Conservatives are a better bet for me than Labour at the moment.” https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/27/the-labour-stronghold-that-could-fall-to-reform/ One headline caught my eye…. “Labour Peer Predicts Party Will ‘Get its Head Kicked In’ by Farage over Failure to Address Working Class Concerns”https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/04/27/labour-peer-predicts-party-will-get-its-head-kicked-in-by-farages-reform/ His choice of language makes his feelings on the matter quite clear. It’s thuggish street fighting talk. Football fans even put it into song for the opposition. “You’re Gonna Get Your F[n]ucking Head Kicked In”, sometimes pluralised to “You’re Gonna Get Your F[n]ucking Heads Kicked In”, is a football chant originating in England. It is also used, apparently, as a case study in psychology and sociology. He could have said we will get trounced, lose badly etc etc etc. The inference is obvious, low class thugs vote Reform. To TWTW, Pielke’s recommendations ignore the most fundamental problem: the omission of physical evidence that contradicts the general conclusions. “To me” that’s a bit unfair to Roger. The copy of the “Official Federal Definition of Scientific Integrity” … which came with the recommendation that “federal agencies should adopt this definition, incorporate it into their scientific integrity policy, and communicate it to their workforce” … that I came across was for the HHS “federal agency” (direct link) : HHS adopts the following Official Federal Definition of Scientific Integrity: Scientific integrity is the adherence to professional practices, ethical behavior, and the principles of honesty and objectivity when conducting, managing, using the results of, and communicating about science and scientific activities. Inclusivity, transparency, and protection from inappropriate influence are hallmarks of scientific integrity. Scientific integrity is the adherence to professional practices, ethical behavior, and the principles of honesty and objectivity when conducting, managing, using the results of, and communicating about science and scientific activities. Inclusivity, transparency, and protection from inappropriate influence are hallmarks of scientific integrity. I think that “the omission of physical evidence” is therefore covered when Roger wrote : The only addition I’d make today is to explicitly recognize that any NCA should follow the guidelines of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and [OMB] and agency guidelines for scientific integrity and information quality. . Any “Real Scientist” (TM) who sees the words “honesty” and “scientific integrity” will also be reminded of Richard Feynman’s public lecture about “cargo-cult science”, which includes : There is one feature I notice that is generally missing in cargo cult science, it’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty — a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid — not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked — to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.

Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can — if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong — to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.

In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another. not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; Unfortunately, GHE believers are not scientists, as Richard Feynman describes science. Fanatical cultists would seem to be a more appropriate description. They have some bizarre notion that thermometers becoming hotter is not due to increased man-made heat, but rather the outputs of the combustion of hydrocarbons, namely CO2 and H2O. No amount of either, added to air, will make it hotter. Unbelievable gullibility, except that it is widely believed by people who are well educated and highly qualified. It just goes to show that intelligence is no protection against self deception. Roger Pielke did get this one wrong: First, the assessment should be housed within and implemented entirely from a federal agency within the scope of the USGCRP. There should be no oversight or control exerted from the White House. ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House. ‘ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House.’ You need to add provisos to the effect that this statement only holds if the Executive Branch is headed by a Democrat, and that if this condition is not met, oversight and control of these agencies will pass to the Democrat National Committee and/or such assignees as they may name. You need to add provisos . . . Why is that? “ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House.” Not true according to Google’s AI bot which outputs the following: “There are federal agencies that operate independently from the Executive Branch, primarily those classified as independent regulatory agencies and some independent agencies within the executive branch. These agencies are not subject to direct presidential control, although they do maintain some form of relationship with the executive branch. “Here’s a more detailed explanation: Independent Regulatory Agencies: These agencies, like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are established by Congress and have the power to make regulations and enforce laws, often without direct presidential oversight. Independent Agencies within the Executive Branch: Examples include the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which operate with a degree of independence from the direct control of the President.” {my bold emphasis added} From the Fifth Climate Assessment Report: Somehow, I remain “skeptical,” if by skeptical, I mean gagging on propaganda. The findings in this report are based on a comprehensive review and assessment of information sources determined to meet the standards and documentation required under the Information Quality Act and the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (App. 2), including peer-reviewed literature, other literature, Indigenous Knowledge, other expert and local knowledge, and climate data processed and prepared for authors by NOAA’s Technical Support Unit (TSU; see Guide to the Report section below and App. 3). NCA5 was thoroughly reviewed by Federal Government experts, external experts, and the public multiple times throughout the report development process. An expert external review was performed by an ad hoc committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.3 Additional information on the development of this Assessment can be found in Appendix 1: Assessment Development Process. The great genius of the founding fathers was that they didn’t set up one government, they created the federal government as essentially three governments. Each with its own powers. The three branches were set up in opposition to the others, such that no branch could do anything on its own. They also set up the state governments to be in opposition to the federal government. To our regret, later generations decided that efficiency was more important, so they tore down many of the walls the founders had set up. As a result, we now have the Beast of Columbia, that rules over all of us with an iron fist. ‘They also set up the state governments to be in opposition to the federal government.’ Not true. The original idea was that the people of the sovereign states agreed per ratification of the Constitution to set up a limited federal government. Unfortunately the latter has been highly successful in re-defining ‘limited’ over time, although I think some people are starting to wake up. Under the above article’s subheading of Science Supporting the Endangerment Finding?, the British medical publication the Lancet is quoted as stating: “In 2009, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed the science-rooted Endangerment Finding, stating that greenhouse gases ‘threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations’. This finding became the cornerstone of most US climate policies and influenced many others globally.” “Science-rooted Endangerment Finding” . . . who are they (both the EPA and the Lancet) kidding? Also, underneath this quote are these statements from the article’s TWTW author(s): “Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis, which provides the food for all complex plant life and all animal life on Earth. Where is the physical evidence that it threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations? . . .The Endangerment Finding has no basis in physical science.” Some hard facts to go along with that: Given the current (2025) concentration of CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere is only at around 425 ppm, the Lancet, with its asserted focus on human health, should have noted the following regarding ACCEPTABLE levels of CO2 in air that humans breath over very long time periods: — in general indoor environments (homes/bedrooms, offices, theaters, auditoriums . . . all without overcrowding), the typical CO2 level can be up to 800 ppm CO2 — in school classrooms, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers(ASHRAE) recommends that CO2 levels not exceed 1000 ppm — The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) specifies that industry workers have an allowable 8-hour time-weighted-average of breathing air not to exceed 5,000 ppm CO2 concentration, and going further stating a “short term” exposure limit in breathing air at 30,000 ppm CO2 is acceptable (note: these are specialized work environments, such as work in confined spaces or near CO2-emitting equipment where such high concentrations may be present) — US Navy submarines routinely operate with allowable concentrations in the their breathable air having up to 11,000 ppm CO2; their maximum, non-emergency upper limit for CO2 concentration is 30,000 ppm (3%); the Navy conducted numerous studies in the 1960’s–1970’s and found that two weeks of continuous breathing of air with CO2 concentrations at 40,000 ppm did not affect performance on multiple tests of cognitive function in physically fit young men — Aboard the International Space Station, the minimum CO2 concentration in the ambient, breathable air is approximately 3,000 ppm, but can reach values greater than 6,500 ppm. The mean concentration is not reduced below 3,000 ppm due to the stations’s limited supply of electrical energy and the capacity of its “air scrubbing” equipment to do such. In addition to the above, when just sitting around humans exhale air having a CO2 concentration in the range of 4–5%, that’s 40,000–50,000 ppm! Yet the EPA Endangement Finding declares CO2 at a value of 850 ppm (the measured atmospheric level back in 2009) threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations??? Obviously, there was no science whatsoever supporting the EPA’s “Finding”. A “bipartisan” commission to repair the NCA, per Roger Pielkie Jr., will probably fix nothing. I point to the example of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (or Simpson–Bowles). Did that do any good?

Title: Parties involved in CK Hutchison's port transaction must not circumvent review process: China's State Administration for Market Regulation

Global Times By Global Times Published: Apr 27, 2025 08:32 PM China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said on Sunday that it is paying close attention to CK Hutchison's planned sale of its overseas port assets and will conduct a review in accordance with the law, CCTV reported. The regulator emphasized that all parties involved in the transaction must not take any measures to circumvent the review process by any means or implement concentration activities without regulatory approval. Otherwise, legal responsibility will be pursued, CCTV reported. The SAMR's statement came in response to media inquiries following a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report on April 16. The WSJ reported that CK Hutchison plans to split its overseas port asset sale into two separate transactions, as a way to advance the deals. According to the WSJ, the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is considering carving out two Panamanian ports from the $22.8 billion deal to purchase dozens of terminals from CK Hutchison, citing sources familiar with the matter. MSC has reportedly discussed advancing the majority of the acquisition, which involves 41 port terminals across five continents, while resolving disputes over the two Panamanian ports, the WSJ reported. The deal involves collaboration with US asset manager BlackRock and has been structured into two components with different ownership frameworks: one for the Panama ports and another for the remaining assets. Discussions on the two components are moving in parallel, and separating the Panama ports would ultimately require the parties to reach a new agreement, according to the WSJ. The WSJ further noted that the BlackRock-MSC consortium and Hutchison are currently within a 145-day exclusive negotiation period and have not yet signed final agreements. Prior to the report, a spokesperson from the second antitrust enforcement division of SAMR said on March 28 that it would review CK Hutchison's Panama Canal ports deal in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to a Q&A release conducted by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei Media and published on the regulator's official website. On March 31, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded to the SAMR's review of the planned port asset sale at a press briefing, stressing that China firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries' legitimate rights and interests.

Title: DJT Stock Soars 57% as Trump Media Expands Into Financial Services

ByJoel Shulman ByJoel Shulman, Contributor. Trump Media and Technology Soars 57% in 2 weeks with Support from New Deals with Crypto.com and ... More Yorkville America Digital Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) has delivered a stunning stock market performance in recent weeks. Since April 8, DJT shares have rocketed roughly +57%, making it the #1 stock in the Russell 1000 Growth Index over that period and outperforming the second-best performer by about 10 percentage points. The stock jumped from about $16.66 on April 8 to $26.14 by April 25. Such a meteoric rise evokes memories of meme-stock short squeezes — and indeed, DJT’s past rallies have featured that dynamic — but this time a different force is at work. Rather than a flash-in-the-pan frenzy, the surge in DJT appears driven by ambitious growth moves and strategic partnerships, not just a short squeeze. The company is leveraging its Trump-brand loyal following and expanding into financial services in ways that could signal significant long-term opportunity. DJT stock price surged in April 2025, far outpacing the broader market and its peers. DJT’s recent rally has been nothing short of remarkable. In a span of just over two weeks, the stock price climbed nearly 60%, decisively beating not only the broader market but every other name in the large-cap growth index. Historically, such explosive moves in Trump-linked stocks have often been attributed to technical market mechanics — notably short sellers getting squeezed. Last autumn, for example, Trump Media’s stock saw a triple-digit percentage spike largely due to a classic short squeeze as speculators betting against the company found few shares available to buy back. Donald Trump owns roughly 57% of the company’s stock, a stake unlikely to trade anytime soon, which severely limited the float and turbocharged that squeeze. This time around, however, many analysts agree the primary catalyst isn’t a short squeeze. Yes, there are still skeptics shorting DJT — and with Trump’s large insider ownership, any increase in short interest could quickly become precarious for them. But the current buying pressure is coming from concrete business developments and investor optimism about new revenue streams, rather than a sudden rush of shorts covering positions. In other words, the market is rallying behind DJT’s growth story, not just a trading technicality. A major catalyst is the recent announcement that Yorkville America Digital has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and Crypto.com to launch a series of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded products (ETPs) through the Truth.Fi brand. The initial ETPs are expected to focus on cryptocurrencies, bringing together powerful brands and marketing reach to a fast-growing financial sector. According to public statements, TMTG CEO Devin Nunes described the agreement as a major step in diversifying TMTG into financial services and digital assets. Yorkville America Digital CEO Troy Rillo also emphasized that the new products would align with America-First investment themes and anticipated strong demand from investors once the ETFs launch later this year. This strategic partnership leverages the brand power of TMTG, the financial expertise of Yorkville America Digital, and the technological infrastructure of Crypto.com. It marks a decisive step for TMTG, moving beyond media into the lucrative world of financial products with minimal capital outlay and maximum brand leverage. In recent weeks, there has been a flurry of public announcements from Troy Rillo, CEO of Yorkville America Digital, who has announced deals with Crypto.com, SMA partnerships, and other forthcoming ETF offerings. These moves reflect an ambitious and aggressive push into financial services, offering new product lines that could rapidly generate fee-based revenue streams for Trump Media. For investors, these moves into fintech represent a dramatic broadening of Trump Media’s business model. The company best known for Truth Social and Truth+ streaming is now positioning itself to capture a slice of the booming ETF and crypto investment market. The global ETF market exceeds $10 trillion in assets, so even a small foothold could translate into significant revenue for TMTG via management fees or partnerships. One of the strategic aces up TMTG’s sleeve is the Trump brand itself – and the unusually loyal following that comes with it. In the ultra-competitive world of ETFs and crypto offerings, garnering investor attention is half the battle. Millions of supporters of Donald Trump have a cultural or ideological affinity for his ventures, and that could translate into immediate demand for products like Truth.Fi’s “patriotic” investment funds. This unique audience gives Trump Media a critical distribution and marketing advantage that most new entrants could never replicate. Moreover, Truth Social already attracts many crypto enthusiasts (drawn by pro-freedom, anti-establishment sentiments), and TMTG can cross-promote Truth.Fi products to those users at minimal cost. In a world where dozens of crypto ETFs and hundreds of altcoins compete for attention, a high-profile name like “Trump” attached to an investment vehicle provides instant differentiation. Beyond the brand cachet, Trump Media’s approach to entering new markets is notable for its capital efficiency. Rather than building an entire financial services arm from scratch, TMTG is partnering with established players to do the heavy lifting — while it provides the brand and audience. This kind of model can be extremely high-margin. Essentially, every dollar of revenue generated from, say, an ETF fee or a trading spread on Crypto.com, comes with minimal incremental cost for TMTG. The infrastructure and operational expenses are borne by partners, so Trump Media’s share of the economics is almost pure profit. It’s the concept of an “infinite ROI” — leveraging someone else’s investment to generate returns for your company. A classic analogy is Dell’s strategy: Dell would bundle third-party peripherals (like monitors, printers, and accessories made by other companies) with its computers and sell them to customers. Dell didn’t spend a dime on developing those peripherals, yet it earned a margin on each sale — an essentially infinite return on that portion of the transaction. Trump Media is employing a similar playbook. By partnering with Yorkville America Digital and Crypto.com, it can offer financial products under the Truth.Fi brand without bearing the full development cost. Revenues from these products (such as fund management fees or revenue-sharing on trading activity) drop straight to the bottom line for TMTG. Importantly, this strategy also accelerates time-to-market and reduces execution risk. Instead of spending years and tens of millions of dollars building a crypto trading platform or ETF team, TMTG plugged into partners that already have these capabilities. What does all this mean for DJT’s future? In short, substantial potential upside. The company’s core social media business (Truth Social) has yet to prove it can generate massive revenues, but these new financial ventures could open multiple new income streams. If even one of the Truth.Fi ETFs attracts significant assets, it could mean millions in annual fee revenue for TMTG with very little incremental expense. There are virtually endless possibilities for additional financial products (think crypto lending, payments, or co-branded credit cards) that could be introduced leveraging the same partnership-driven model. It’s also worth noting that while this rally isn’t primarily a short squeeze, the ingredients for one are still in place. Donald Trump’s large ownership stake (over half the company) means the effective float of tradable shares is limited, so any surge in demand could send shorts scrambling to cover. By focusing on fundamentals and executing a solid strategy, TMTG could actually set the stage for another short squeeze — rewarding loyal investors even further. With momentum building and a credible growth plan unfolding, DJT is a stock that investors can no longer afford to ignore. Love or hate the politics around it, the company is demonstrating real business initiative — moving aggressively into fintech in a way that monetizes the Trump brand’s unique strengths. The recent 57% surge in the stock’s value is a reflection of that newfound optimism. Could the shares be volatile? Certainly. But the upside scenario — where Truth.Fi and other partnerships add meaningful revenue and earnings — suggests this rally may have more room to run. Moreover, management hints that additional deal announcements are on the way, which could further bolster the bull case. In a market full of growth stocks, DJT has set itself apart at the top of the leaderboard, and it could just be getting started. ------------------------------------ Disclosure Note: past performance is no guarantee of future results.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: What Tech Workforce Changes Could Mean For Opportunistic Family Offices

ByFrancois Botha ByFrancois Botha, Senior Contributor. The Intel headquarters in Santa Clara could end up a ghost town if their planned "de-laboring" ends ... More up being an extensive exercise. The past week’s markets seem confused. Alphabet’s stock price went up after strong earnings, great news for investors, even while the company has significantly reduced jobs. Major tech businesses including Intel and Meta are cutting large numbers of workers. Public interest as seen in Google trends about these changes continues to rise, showing that something deeper than just cost cuts is taking place. These moves point to broader market shifts as companies put more focus on artificial intelligence and reconsider staffing and global trade issues. Family offices investing in public and private technology companies will likely pay close attention. Three critical areas now require their focus: managing investment risk, finding talented people, and discovering new business opportunities. Managing Investment Risk in an Uncertain Market Tech companies today don’t just deal with internal changes like layoffs and cost reductions. Bigger global issues such as tariffs, trade conflicts, and political challenges directly affect the companies’ costs, supply chains, and profits. Family offices, in turn, must now consider these global factors carefully. It's no longer enough to just review a company's quarterly earnings or internal plans. Tariff changes, broken supply chains, and shifting international trade rules must all factor into an investor’s planning. To manage these risks, family offices should carefully evaluate how global issues affect each business they invest in. They should also spread their investments across different markets or industries to lower overall risk and protect against unexpected events. People as Assets, Not Costs: Building Teams for the Future Recent workforce reductions at tech companies have placed many skilled professionals back onto the hiring market. For family offices, this creates fresh opportunity to hire talent for their own teams or for the businesses they support. Many family offices are now operating similarly to technology startup teams. They view finding and hiring talented people as an investment, rather than viewing employees as expenses. Skills related to cyber security, artificial intelligence, digital compliance, and data analysis have become especially valuable. To succeed, family offices must invest in training and developing their teams. They should encourage staff to expand their knowledge and skills and give employees the opportunity to learn new tasks. Family offices can also help the businesses they own in identifying and hiring people with valuable skills who might otherwise be missed. Success won't result from reacting after the fact. It requires thoughtful planning and a commitment to continually build and reshape effective, adaptable teams. Humans and Technology Working Together Recent tech industry adjustments have raised questions about the future role of workers. Many discussions revolve around which tasks humans will continue to perform and which can be handled by artificial intelligence and technology. These discussions shouldn’t focus exclusively on replacing human workers. Instead, effective solutions will involve people and technology working side by side. Human abilities such as judgment, critical thinking, and contextual understanding remain difficult for machines to handle and will remain highly important for years to come. Family offices that understand this reality will hire people whose skills complement technology. Areas such as compliance, ethical considerations, client relationships, and interpretation of data still clearly depend on human understanding. Importantly, family offices should look for team members who are flexible, eager to learn new skills, and open to evolving their roles as technology advances and market needs change. Staying Flexible in a Changing Market The recent tech sector changes signal deeper shifts than ordinary market ups and downs. Family offices risk serious disappointment when they follow trends without careful thought. Instead, successful family offices will focus on thoughtful analysis and maintain patience, remaining ready to quickly adapt to market changes. To navigate successfully, family offices should question popular assumptions and avoid investments driven by hype. They should examine each potential opportunity carefully and clearly. Those who keep an open mind, remain committed to learning, and think independently will be best suited to thrive. Opportunistic family offices can stand out by understanding market conditions thoroughly, thoughtfully building strong teams, effectively pairing human insight with technology, and preparing themselves to respond decisively to change.

Even before those 50,000 layoffs in 2025, Silicon Valley's Mercury News was citing some interesting statistics from economic research/consulting firm Beacon Economics. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the San Francisco Bay Area added 74,700 tech jobs But then in 2023 and 2024 the industry had slashed even more tech jobs -- 80,200 -- for a net loss (over five years) of 5,500. So is there really a cutback in perks and a fear of layoffs that's casting a pall over the industry? share your own thoughts and experiences in the comments. Do you agree with the picture that's being painted by the Wall Street Journal? They told their readers that tech workers are now "just like the rest of us: miserable at work."

Today, however, the region is home to several startups that have reached billion-dollar valuations. Some of these startups, propelled into the spotlight by cross-border expansion, are now recognized beyond their home countries, with Nubank notably going public in the U.S. Yet, there is a broader cohort of Latin American scale-ups that deserve attention; many in fintech, but not exclusively. Other important sectors include e-commerce, health tech, logistics, proptech, and SaaS. Some homegrown unicorns may currently hold “paper valuations” from rounds that were raised during the 2021 peak, but the point still stands: They are worth knowing, and many could recover alongside the market, as VC investment in Latin America demonstrated resilience in 2024. As a group, these unicorns also reflect Latin America’s multiple startup hubs. While Brazil and Mexico remain leaders in numbers, unicorns have also emerged from Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay, further strengthening these ecosystems. Let’s take a closer look at the top Latin American unicorns by valuation — although the oldest price tags often need to be taken with a grain of salt. Coming out of Colombia, Rappi is an on-demand delivery platform that became a super app and expanded into multiple countries. Its rise solidified before the pandemic: In 2019, it raised a $1 billion investment from SoftBank. But its $5.25 billion valuation was attached to the round of more than $500 million it secured in July 2021. Since then, Rappi has operated in a more challenging environment, conducting multiple rounds of layoffs and facing changing gig economy legislation in Mexico, where it now plans to invest $110 million to boost its operations. However, the company still very much hopes to IPO and hired a CFO to prepare for that endeavor after reaching break-even for the first time in late 2023. QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company focused on the rental and sale of residential real estate. With commercial activities in six Latin American countries and a tech hub in Europe, it made several acquisitions and grew into a group with a headcount of more than 3,500 people. In 2021, the startup was busy on the fundraising front: Less than three months after announcing a $300 million Series E at a $4 billion valuation, QuintoAndar raised an additional $120 million at a $5.1 billion valuation. With $755 million raised to date, its cap table includes Kaszek, General Atlantic, SoftBank, and Tencent. Creditas is a Brazilian fintech player specializing in loans, including consumer credit. Its latest round of funding was a $260 million Series F in January 2022 valuing the Brazilian lender at $4.8 billion, up from $1.75 billion in December 2020. The Series F was led by Fidelity, with participation from new and existing backers, including Kaszek Ventures, QED Investors, and SoftBank. It was extended in July 2022 at the same valuation, allowing Creditas to buy the Brazilian license of Andorran bank Andbank for some $93 million. Branded as Tiendanube in Spanish-speaking markets, Nuvemshop is a Brazilian e-commerce platform designed for SMEs and entrepreneurs to sell products and services online — or in short, “Latin America’s answer to Shopify.” Its latest known valuation of $3.1 billion comes from the $500 million Series E mega-round co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management that it raised in August 2021, only a few months after its Accel-led $90 million Series D. Wildlife Studios is a Brazilian mobile gaming company. It was co-founded by Victor Lazarte, now also a general partner at Benchmark, the VC firm that led Wildlife Studios’ $60 million Series A in 2019 at a $1.3 billion valuation. Less than a year later, the startup reached a nearly $3 billion valuation from its Series B round. In a candid conversation onstage at Slush 2023, Lazarte said that, in retrospect, raising too much capital at too high a valuation so fast was a “mistake.” In June 2023, the company announced that former Amazon executive Peter Hill would replace Lazarte as CEO. It also conducted several rounds of layoffs. Loft is a Brazilian proptech company supported by big Silicon Valley names since its genesis in 2018. Loft’s $175 million Series C was co-led by a16z and Vulcan Capital in 2020. A $425 million Series D led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners followed in March 2021, and its extension in April 2021 valued the company at $2.9 billion. The digital real estate platform wasn’t immune to the market turn. It conducted two rounds of layoffs in 2022 but denied having raised a down round in November 2022. In 2023, after fresh funding from a sovereign fund in the Middle East” at an undisclosed valuation and another round of layoffs, it claimed to have reached break-even. Unico is a Brazilian ID tech startup, and one of Latin America’s largest SaaS companies. Its $2.6 billion valuation is more recent than many on this list. It came from the $100 million Series D the company raised in April 2022. The round was led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from existing investors General Atlantic and SoftBank Latin America Fund. C6 Bank is a Brazilian digital bank. Unlike some competitors, it hasn’t expanded beyond Brazil, where it has more than 35 million clients. C6 was valued at $2.28 billion in December 2020, six months before JPMorgan Chase acquired 40% ownership of the neobank in 2021. After increasing its stake in 2023, it now owns 46% of C6, which had its first-ever profitable year in 2024. With backers including General Catalyst and SoftBank, Kavak is a Mexico-based e-commerce platform to buy and sell used cars online. Once valued at $8.7 billion after a Series E round that doubled its valuation in 2021, Kavak saw its valuation slashed by $6.5 billion following expansion difficulties and layoffs. After raising a $127 million equity round and securing two $200 million debt facilities in March 2025, the company aims to position itself for a potential IPO within the next three to five years. Bitso is a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange that also facilitates cross-border payments. In May 2021, it secured a $250 million Series C round valuing the company at $2.2 billion and co-led by Tiger Global and Coatue, with participation from new and existing investors, including Kaszek and QED. Known for its InfinitePay and Jim.com brands, CloudWalk is a Brazilian payment infrastructure company (not to be confused with the Chinese facial-recognition software company by the same name). CloudWalk’s $2.15 billion valuation resulted from a $150 million Series C led by Coatue in November 2021. Since then, CloudWalk achieved its first full year of profitability in 2023 and closed 2024 with $497 million in revenue. Briefly known as BlitzPay and founded by former PayPal employees, Clip is the Square of Latin America, with POS devices and fintech solutions for businesses. Clip became a unicorn in 2021 following a $250 million round led by SoftBank and Viking, and maintained this status since then. The $100 million round it raised in June 2024 confirmed its $2 billion valuation as the company was “on the brink of profitability,” its CEO told Bloomberg. Loggi is a Brazil-based logistics company known for its focus on last-mile delivery. Its backers include Monashees, Qualcomm Ventures, and SoftBank. Its latest funding round was a $205 million Series F led by CapSur Capital in March 2021 at a valuation close to $2 billion. Bets are still open on who may join the list and how the rankings might be reordered, so we’ll make sure to keep it updated. Topics Freelance Reporter Anna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant.

Title: SPAS-12 History Value: Legacy and Rising Price
URL: https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/spas-12-shotgun-history-value-ban/
Time Published: 2025-04-27T14:00:00Z

The SPAS-12 shotgun, with its rich history and significant value, stands as one of the most iconic firearms of its time. Known for its unique design and powerful performance, the SPAS-12’s history and value have only grown over the years, making it a prized collectible for enthusiasts. Check out our video reel showcasing the SPAS-12 in action on Facebook and Instagram: The SPAS-12 (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun) was a combat shotgun manufactured by the Italian firearms company Franchi S.p.A. from 1979 to 2000. Initially designed as a law enforcement and military shotgun, the SPAS-12 became iconic due to its unique dual-mode action, allowing it to function as both a semi-automatic and pump-action shotgun. Its distinctive appearance, combined with a folding metal stock, heat shield, and overall aggressive design, contributed to its cult status among firearm enthusiasts, collectors, and Hollywood filmmakers alike. The SPAS-12 was unique in that it was one of the few shotguns designed with a dual-action mode, allowing the user to switch between semi-automatic and pump-action operation. The ability to cycle between these modes gave it a tactical advantage in specific scenarios. In semi-automatic mode, it could rapidly fire shells, while in pump-action mode, it could handle a broader range of ammunition, including lower-powered shells that might not cycle in a gas-operated system. Some other notable features include: Due to its versatility and intimidating appearance, the SPAS-12 was marketed toward military, law enforcement, and civilian buyers, although it was ultimately restricted in many regions due to firearm regulations. In 1994, the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) was enacted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (Public Law No. 103-322). This legislation restricted the sale and importation of certain firearms based on a set of cosmetic and functional features, rather than their actual operational capabilities. The SPAS-12, with its tactical appearance, pistol grip, and semi-automatic functionality, was classified as an “excessively lethal firearm” by proponents of the ban. Critics of the law, including firearm experts and enthusiasts, pointed out that the SPAS-12 was mechanically similar to other commonly used semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns used for hunting, skeet shooting, and home defense. Despite this, the gun’s aggressive aesthetic led it to be vilified by gun-control advocates who often lacked technical knowledge about firearms (Koper, 2004). This flawed logic exposed the major weaknesses of the ban. The legislation focused heavily on appearances rather than functionality, meaning firearms that operated identically to banned guns but looked different remained legal. The SPAS-12, for example, was essentially just a heavier, bulkier version of many legally available shotguns. The law failed to target criminal misuse of firearms, instead restricting law-abiding citizens from purchasing certain guns simply because they looked “scary.” Further demonstrating its ineffectiveness, a 2004 study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice found that the Assault Weapons Ban had no measurable impact on gun violence during its ten-year enforcement (Koper, 2004). Even the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) conducted a meta-analysis and found “insufficient evidence” that banning certain firearms reduced crime rates (Hahn et al., 2005). The sunset clause in the AWB ensured that the law would expire on September 13, 2004, unless renewed by Congress, which did not occur (Kleck, 2001). However, due to the ban’s restrictions on importation, shipments of the SPAS-12 to the United States ended in 1994, with Franchi ultimately ceasing production of the model in 2000. Ironically, instead of reducing access to “dangerous weapons,” the ban fueled demand for firearms like the SPAS-12, driving up prices and making them more desirable to collectors. Today, the SPAS-12 remains a sought-after collectible, proving that cosmetic bans do little more than inconvenience lawful gun owners while failing to address actual crime. The SPAS-12 gained legendary status not only among firearm collectors but also in Hollywood and video games. It was famously wielded by Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800 in The Terminator (1984), reinforcing its image as a formidable weapon. Additionally, Robert Muldoon, the game warden in Jurassic Park (1993), carried a SPAS-12 while facing off against velociraptors. The gun also became a staple in the gaming world, appearing in franchises such as: This widespread representation cemented the SPAS-12’s place in pop culture, making it one of the most recognizable shotguns ever produced. Many firearm enthusiasts consider the SPAS-12 to be a “grail gun”, meaning it is a highly desirable and rare firearm in the collecting community. The limited availability and cultural significance of the SPAS-12 have led to a massive increase in its market value. When the shotgun was still in production, its retail price in the United States was approximately $1,500 in its final year of availability. By 2016, auction prices for the SPAS-12 had climbed to an average of $2,588 (Rock Island Auction, 2016). The value increase continued at an unprecedented rate, and by 2022, the price of an SPAS-12 at auction had skyrocketed to an average of $7,000. As of 2025, the SPAS-12 remains one of the hottest collectibles in the firearms market, with some pristine examples exceeding $10,000 at auction. This dramatic price surge outpaces many other classic firearms and highlights the enduring demand for rare and historically significant tactical shotguns (Miller, 2023).

Additionally, they offer custom heirloom-grade display cases and handcrafted leather goods built to last. The Benelli M2 also has the option to switch between semi-auto and pump, though the semi action is inertia blowback instead of gas-operated. That makes the cycling unreliable when the M2 isn’t fully shouldered/supported (like when firing from the hip). Similar to “limp-wristing” a Glock. I remember those things. The joke at time was that it was called SPAS because a spase is what it is. (Slang at the time among teens for another kid that was socially awkward.) Never owned one, but I did own a Benelli M3 Super 90. Pump/auto. Neither fish nor fowl. Hated it. Disposed of it at the first gun show I could. Liked all the M1 Super 90s I owned. Let’s see 1500 in 2000 money adjusted for inflation to 2025 would be 2,785 so 2016 probably would have been the last reasonable price.

Despite this, the gun’s aggressive aesthetic led it to be vilified by gun-control advocates who often lacked technical knowledge about firearms (Koper, 2004).” The old piss poor sporting purpose defense of the 2A all while not defining Gun Control by its History…how dare we embarrass our Gun Control colleagues. The Founders and millions of defenseless victims of Gun Control were rolling over in their graves. Thankfully Bush II let the clinton/biden Gun Control insanity sunset. As for Franchi they produce nice shotguns. I own one since 1996. There are easier shotguns to use in pump action and reload, but when you start shooting it fast in semiauto, the muzzle rise is minimal. Also the recoil is… tame. That thing shoots fast and straight. I love it, and after many thousands of rounds, tens of thousands, it still goes as new. Top!!! “Robust build”? Except for those parts made from plastic which are getting brittle with age. Plastic doesn’t get brittle. I’ve a pair of Glocks made in 1851 and they’re still as robust as they were when Wild Bill Hickok was using them. I forgot to say. $10,000 for one of these things? What do they say about a fool and his money? This is not a three digit serial number, first generation Colt SAA calvary model. Scarcity is a bitch, see also Colt python pre2020, s&w pre lock, pre freedom group Marlin lever rifles for silliness at the low end. Could probably throw in Kimber for pre mim parts Safe, I understand. I have a 6″ stainless Python that I bought for myself as a present to myself when I got out of the U. S. Army. A long time ago. I can touch a 6 1/2″ 2nd model hand ejector target.44 Spl and a S&W 28 Highway Patrolman now. Everyone says they’re worth a lot more than I paid for them. Good. But a SPAS? No accounting for collectors, still at a loss to explain the $500+ pricing for Nagant rifles. Supply shortage caused by the war in Ukraine? Many have been spotted being used in the conflict. The market will achieve equilibrium. If they were still in production and not disappearing on a battlefield where they will never get to the US sure. Realistically it will be a long time of a lot of estate sales allowing them to trickle back into the market that has enough other desirable products to see any reasonable drop in prices for milsurp of any kind…….. except maybe m1 carbines we may eventually get some of those back in large numbers.

Title: A Possible Recession Clue And Earnings Bonanza Upcoming

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. In addition to the busiest week of earnings season, the economic calendar is packed with impactful ... More data, like first-quarter US GDP and the monthly jobs report. It is possible that US GDP contracted in the first quarter, but tariffs complicate the analysis. In the second busiest period of earnings releases, 119 S&P 500 companies reported earnings last week. 73% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With 184 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week, it is the busiest week of the reporting season. In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with impactful data, like first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product and the monthly jobs report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The communications services sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL) was the most significant contributor to the increase in earnings for the communications services sector, which rose to 23.3% from 4.4%. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 10.1% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Comments from the Trump administration about some negotiations on Chinese tariffs and rumors of impending trade deals with India and Japan boosted stocks. The better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks soaring by 4.6% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 10% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed by a wide margin last week. The group exited bear market territory but is 19.8% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Returns After the concern a few weeks ago about the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness, yields have been drifting lower since April 11. At the time, several less frightening factors seemed to be more likely causes of the increase in yields than some mass exodus from U.S. dollar-based assets, and yields even moved lower last week despite the robust rally in risk assets. The 10-year Treasury yield has been down 0.25% since April 11, with most of the decline in yields due to a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. This usually happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The U.S. dollar has rebounded from its April 21 low, despite concerns among some that it might be falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. A look at the dollar's longer-term history shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999, so it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration might welcome some depreciation of the dollar to boost exports. US Dollar Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported last week, and they provided a mixed bag. Tesla earnings were below expectations, but the stock rallied on the news that Elon Musk would soon be curtailing his government activities and returning to company management. Alphabet’s results were impressive, showing strong growth in cloud services and better monetization of its artificial intelligence offerings. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Beyond the Magnificent 7, the busiest week of the reporting season, has many notable companies scheduled, including Pfizer (PFE), Mastercard (MA), Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), and Berkshire Hathway (BRK/A, BRK/B). According to FactSet data, Alphabet (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Comcast (CMCSA) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the communication services sector. Healthcare, industrials, and technology sectors also saw better earnings growth rates last week. The healthcare sector benefited from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which both swung from losses in the same quarter last year to better-than-expected profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Markets will remain very attuned to news flow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of economic growth headwind. In addition to a packed earnings calendar, some top-tier economic releases this week could impact markets. Though it is backward-looking, the first quarter GDP report should provide some clues as to how much momentum the U.S. had at the start of the year. Care will need to be taken when looking at the GDP data, since there are some unique factors due to the tariff announcements. Because the data is messy and its current forecast calls for a 2.5% contraction in first-quarter GDP, the Atlanta Fed even produced an alternative forecast that adjusts for the import and export of gold, which is at a more reasonable -0.4%. Consensus estimates from economists are currently at +0.4%. 1Q 2025 US Economic Growth Estimates A negative first-quarter GDP print could prompt many people to argue that the economy is already in recession. While the simple definition of recession has been two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the National Bureau of Economic Research has historically been the final arbiter of dating the business cycle. The NBER uses many factors and typically takes a significant period before an official verdict, so it isn’t invaluable in the moment. Given that the threat of tariffs likely caused a substantial increase in imports to front-run the additional costs, which would decrease headline GDP, final sales to private domestic purchasers will be a better measure to watch. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. For example, in 2022, the initial estimate of second-quarter GDP contracted, completing the second decline in a row. While the second quarter GDP was eventually revised away, the continued growth of final sales to private domestic purchasers at the time would lead a sensible person to conclude that it remained a soft patch but not yet a recession. The disruptions aren’t the same in 2025, but the 2022 economic data was also subject to significant noise after the pandemic. Measures Of US Economic Activity The monthly jobs report is likely even more critical than GDP since jobs are crucial to allowing U.S. consumers to continue spending to support economic growth. The job market has been softening this year, but is still adding jobs, which is not a recessionary characteristic. Consensus estimates point to modest non-farm payroll growth of 130,000 in April and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Investors must work hard to cut through the tariff noise in the economic and earnings releases this week. While a recession signal is unlikely, there should be some signs of an economy continuing to lose some steam. The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting and first quarter earnings release are this weekend. While Warren Buffett has avoided discussing politics recently, he might be willing to provide some insights into the expected impact on Berkshire’s diversified group of businesses.

Title: Will Starlink and other satellite companies eventually rival cellular carriers?

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onApril 26, 2025 Starlink has truly opened our eyes to the power of satellite technology, delivering speeds that rival cable internet in areas previously lacking high-speed options. But Starlink isn’t just about traditional internet use. Earlier this year, T-Mobile and Starlink introduced emergency satellite-to-cell features, including full texting, to mobile phone users for the first time. More recently, Verizon and some of its MVNOs followed suit with a more limited satellite-to-cell service launch for Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 users, in cooperation with Skylo. As satellite providers increasingly team up with major carriers, you might wonder: Will satellite technology ever surpass traditional services from big providers? It’s a compelling thought, but the reality is more complicated. Let’s take a closer look at the major players in the satellite-to-cell space, what they currently offer, and their publicly announced future plans. We’ll also explore the roadblocks holding satellite technology back in the mobile world and whether these issues might eventually become a thing of the past. Although numerous companies are involved in satellite technology, only a handful have directly pursued satellite-to-cell capabilities so far. Recently, Starlink has emerged as the most widely available service, even though its features remain in public beta. Nevertheless, several other companies have significant plans for satellite-to-cell technologies in the future. Starlink is best known for its internet service, but it has also become the biggest satellite-to-cell provider as it offers this service indirectly through partnerships, such as with T-Mobile in the US. The great thing about this partnership is that T-Mobile isn’t keeping satellite features exclusive, as it has allowed subscribers from rival networks to use the feature for free during beta. Skylo provides satellite connectivity across various industries through partnerships as opposed to having its own network. While it’s far from a major player in the satellite-to-cell game right now, Skylo most notably powers Verizon’s emergency SOS features on specific devices and is working with other cellular companies and phone makers to expand emergency SOS features. AST SpaceMobile aims to establish its own low-earth orbit satellite-to-cell network similar to Starlink, but it is still in early development. Unlike Starlink, which has over 7,000 satellites (approximately 400 equipped for cellular service), AST SpaceMobile has only launched five satellites capable of satellite-to-cell connectivity features. Iridium is known primarily for traditional satellite phone services, typically requiring specialized equipment for remote or field use. Currently, it offers the Iridium Go hotspot as a standalone device providing limited satellite-to-cell features, though at very slow speeds that are not suitable as a true cellular service replacement. For what it’s worth, we’ve seen other devices like the Go, including the HMD OffGrid. The big difference is that Iridium controls its own network. Iridium briefly partnered with Qualcomm to develop satellite-to-cell capabilities; however, after this partnership fell through, it shifted its attention toward other future collaborations. Globalstar is another major traditional satellite phone provider. While it continues to primarily focus on traditional satellite customers, it is actively pursuing the expanding satellite-to-cell market, notably through its partnership with Apple. To that end, Apple has invested over $1 billion in Globalstar to support satellite-to-cell features like emergency texting on iPhone 14 and newer devices. Likely, Globalstar will eventually extend its efforts to other manufacturers as well. In addition to already working with Skylo, ViaSat also plans to work with it and other partners on its own constellation of low-orbit satellites that will be designed to connect directly to smartphones and IoT devices without requiring ground infrastructure. This system was successfully tested last year through Skylo in the United Arab Emirates, India, and Saudi Arabia, and so it’s only a matter of time before the company ramps up the effort. While HughesNet doesn’t seem to be pursuing satellite-to-cell partnerships with carriers or manufacturers in any major way just yet, that doesn’t mean it isn’t involved at all. HughesNet currently offers its SatCell Connect service for first responders and field use. As you can see, there are plenty of efforts underway to roll out satellite-to-cell technology. For the most part, partnerships remain the favored approach. Given the current trajectory, it’s unlikely that satellite technology will replace terrestrial cellular service anytime soon, if ever. One major reason is that satellite technology often faces larger regulatory hurdles than the cellular industry. This is especially true for low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. LEO constellations are crucial because they are the only type even theoretically capable of replacing terrestrial service. Traditional satellites suffer from latency and speed limitations that make such a replacement effort impractical. Even if we move past regulatory and technical challenges, there are several inherent advantages to traditional cellular service that are difficult to overcome: To be fair, Starlink’s latency isn’t that much worse than that of broadband (at least compared to regular sat), which suggests latency could become a non-issue over time. But capacity remains a major obstacle and solving it would likely require blanketing the sky with billions of satellites. That’s not just expensive, it’s also a future filled with space junk. And although satellite deployment costs may drop over time, land-based infrastructure will almost always be the more economical option. The truth is, satellite providers don’t want to replace traditional cellular service, and you shouldn’t want that either. The ideal model is a hybrid approach, where carriers provide both ground and satellite coverage. While it’s possible that some carriers may eventually develop their own satellite networks, the infrastructure investment would be massive and likely not worth the cost. From a consumer perspective, there’s no real advantage to satellite-only service either. Let’s be honest: most people don’t care (or even want to know) how their phone connects, as long as it works. In the future, satellite backup will likely become so seamless and integrated that you won’t be able to tell whether you’re connected to a ground tower or a satellite, aside from maybe a latency spike or a small indicator on your phone. And that’s the beauty of it: the ability to connect from anywhere. That’s far more appealing than a future reliant on just satellites or towers.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025.

A round-up of the biggest Tech-related news that stood out this week. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. News Weekly is our column where we highlight and summarize some of the week's top stories so you can catch up on the latest tech news. This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. This week, Motorola's Razr 2025 series dropped, Alphabet's Q1 earnings soar, Meta layoffs impact VR teams, Samsung's summer Unpacked could take place in New York, and Android 16's Beta 4 comes out. Let's dive in. Read more here There's a new Motorola Razr on the block. The Motorola Razr 2025 series arrived this week as a trio for the first time. Showcasing the standard Motorola Razr, the Motorola Razr Plus, and an all-new Motorola Razr Ultra. All three devices are bolstered with Moto AI, which is backed by Perplexity AI. The devices also have access to Google's Gemini suite as well. At first glance, the phones look a lot like the previous models. Motorola says that the devices showcase a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate, which is 4x stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. This is paired with an ultra-thin glass that creates a smoother display on these devices. All three models come with Android 15 out of the box, and with an IP48 dust and water resistance. Razr Ultra: Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 arrives with bigger displays when compared to the other two in the lineup. The device features a 4-inch pOLED cover display and a 7-inch main foldable AMOLED display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic. The Razr Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, comes with a 4,700 mAh battery, featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP ultrawide/macro vision camera, and a third 50MP selfie camera. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes in four colorways: Pantone Scarab, Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret. With its premium specs, the Ultra starts at $1,299 and comes with dual storage options of 512GB and 1TB, along with 16GB of RAM. Razr Plus: Razr's premium model just got demoted to being the middle child. This year's Plus variant comes with almost the same specs as last year. With an interactive 4-inch cover display and a 6.9-inch internal foldable pOLED display. The Razr Plus 2025 comes in three colorways: Pantone Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink. The only visible difference is the device's brightness limit. While the cover display achieves 2,400 nits of peak brightness, the main internal display reaches 3,000 nits. At the heart of the device is the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, similar to the Razr Plus 2024. It gets a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and a 32MP front-facing camera. The device has a 256GB built-in storage and 12GB of RAM. As of now, this device will only be available in the U.S. for $999.99. Razr 2025: As for its standard model, the company is keeping it simple while also integrating some premium specs into it. The Motorola Razr 2025 arrives in different finishes and four colorways: Pantone Spring Bud, Pantone Gibraltar Sea, Pantone Parfait Pink, and Pantone Lightest Sky. The standard model features a smaller 3.6-inch pOLED cover display and the same internal 6.9-inch AMOLED screen. At its core, the phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7400X, a notch higher than its predecessor. Regarding its rear cameras, the standard model features a 50MP primary camera system and a 13MP ultra-wide camera equipped with a Macro Vision lens. The device retains its 32MP front camera from its predecessor. The standard model is priced at $699.99, with prices varying based on the carrier in the U.S. and Canada. The Motorola Razr 2025 series will be sold in stores starting May 15. Pre-orders begin on May 7 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola's online store. Along with its clamshells, the company also launched the Motorola Buds Loop, Watch Fit, which are expected to drop in stores this summer. Read more here Alphabet, Google's parent company, released its Q1 earnings on Thursday (April 24), and it was reported that the company's revenue saw a 12% hike year-over-year, with consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion. Google's stock also went up by 2.38% after the market closed later that evening. Its net earnings increased by a large margin of 46%, coming up to $34.54 billion. Google's core businesses, including Search, YouTube advertising, and AI, were sizable contributors to this overall growth. "We’re pleased with our strong Q1 results, which reflect healthy growth and momentum across the business. Underpinning this growth is our unique full-stack approach to AI," said CEO Sundar Pichai Google's Search also saw a gain of $50.7 billion in revenue, YouTube's advertising brought in $8.93 billion to the company, and overall advertising brought in $66.89 billion. And Google Cloud also took the spotlight during this quarter, with its revenue jumping by 28% to $12.3 billion. During the earnings call, Pichai also stated that they're seeing healthy growth and momentum across all their AI-powered products, specifically AI Overviews. Read more here Meta, on Thursday (April 24), laid off an unknown number of employees from its Reality Labs division, which includes employees working in Oculus studios, who are responsible for creating mixed reality wearables as well as games for Meta’s Quest VR headsets. In an email to Android Central, Meta spokesperson said, “Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” the spokesperson said. These cuts are meant to help the Oculus studios work more efficiently on delivering mixed reality experiences, Meta added. Employees working on Supernatural, a VR fitness game, were among those impacted in the latest round of cuts. This was confirmed by Meta's spokesperson as well. They further added that, despite these cuts, "We remain committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged." Read more here A new rumor suggests that Samsung could be taking its mid-year Unpacked event to New York. According to a Korean news site, The JoongAng Daily, Samsung is reportedly moving its Galaxy Unpacked event up, with its new set of foldables, Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 expected to make their debut in the early weeks of July. NYC could allegedly be playing host after three long years. The last time an Unpacked event was held in the location was back in August 2022 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4. An industry insider familiar with Samsung's plan told the publication that, "This time, it will be held again in New York, the most representative cultural city, after three years." There is speculation that the Korean OEM could be switching things up to prioritize the U.S. market. Read more here Earlier this week, Google rolled out Android 16 Beta 4 to all supported Pixels, and it's the last beta before the big launch next month, loaded with fixes, polish, and broader device support. The latest update didn't bring any significant changes, as Google is gearing up to launch the stable version of its OS this summer. Beta 4 packs the April 2025 security patch, which fixes two bugs and a bunch of other critical CVEs. It fixes a weird battery drain, glitchy haptics, and radar not working in the Pixel Weather app. It also tends to certain system stability issues and random launcher crashes that some folks were dealing with. However, a few Pixel users have taken to Reddit to report that the "Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock" option has gone missing after installing the latest Android 16 beta. Those are some of the biggest stories from this week. Meanwhile, here are some other stories that are worth catching up on: Nandika Ravi is an Editor for Android Central.

Title: 5 Dividend Stocks That Are Bucking The Bear Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/04/26/5-dividend-stocks-that-are-bucking-the-bear-market/
Time Published: 2025-04-26T13:52:00Z

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Bearish scenario in stock market with bear figure in front of red price drop chart. Let’s talk about consumer staples dividend stocks today. If we’re heading for a slowdown then we need to be picky about our payouts. When the economy slows, discretionary spending is often punted but staples continue to be bought. Today we’ll discuss five dividends between 4.2% and 10.7%. These “must have” products can provide our portfolios with important recession-resistant qualities. Year-to-date staples have been flat and, in this market, that is great. Their sideways action has lapped the over-owned S&P 500 this year: XLP Total Returns Consumer staples stocks tend to have more stable operations that result in more stable share performance in turbulent markets. And they also have predictable profits that allow them to pay out better-than-average dividends. But there are exceptions. Perpetually too-popular staples like Costco (COST) and Walmart (WMT) deliver sub-1% yields. This also drags down the yields of staples-focused funds. This is why we cherry pick our payouts, as always. Let’s get into these five which yield up to 10.7%. Smokers are going to keep smoking, which is why these two tobacco companies have delivered double-digit gains (against the market’s 15% decline!) since Feb. 19: Altria (MO, 6.9% yield) is best-known for its Philip Morris USA segment, which produces Marlboro cigarettes and is by far and away the company’s top revenue driver. But the company is putting increasing focus on its smokeless products, which include Copenhagen and Skoal smokeless tobacco, On! Oral nicotine pouches, NJOY e-vapor products and—through a joint venture with JT Group called Horizon Innovations—heated tobacco products. Altria has been battling volume declines in cigarettes for years, and it has suffered a few self-inflicted wounds, such as its ill-fated stake in Juul Labs. However, higher prices on cigarettes, as well as growth in its smokeless products, have helped keep earnings and its high dividend on the rise, and both are expected to continue their (admittedly slow) growth in 2025. MO Earnings Growth Ever since the market started sliding in February, investors have been snapping up MO shares to get some of that stability. But Altria is getting expensive—yes, a forward P/E of 11 doesn’t scream “overbought,” but it’s noticeably higher than the 8x-9x valuation it has typically carried over the past few years. British American Tobacco (BTI, 7.5% yield) owns a number of well-known cigarette brands, including Camel, American Spirit and Newport. But it too deals in smokeless tobacco, including Grizzly dipping tobacco, Glo heated tobacco, VELO nicotine pouches, and Vuse vapes. In late 2023, BTI announced it would take a massive noncash writedown—which a few months later would become official, at $34.5 billion—on the value of its American cigarette brands. The stock bottomed in late 2024 and has been recovering ever since, including a roughly 10% gain since the February market top. Despite the writedown, BTI’s top and bottom lines have been generally stable if not improving for years. But the company doesn’t expect sustainable growth until at least 2026, when management believes it will get more support from its smokeless portfolio. Fortunately, the company still keeps finding enough change under the couch to improve its dividend, which it has done in 26 of the past 27 years. A 7%-plus yield is stellar. A forward P/E of 9 not so much once we realize that’s at the high end of its multiyear range. Let’s move on to more traditional consumer staples businesses—but not traditional consumer staples names. The sector’s blue chips tend to be overcrowded, which is a recipe for limited yields. Instead, I prefer stocks that live outside of the spotlight but offer good to great levels of income. SpartanNash (SPTN, 4.2% yield) is a company that we’ve previously discussed as a “grocer-plus.” It operates nearly 200 grocery stores in 10 states across numerous brands, including Family Fresh Market, Metcalfe’s Market and Supermercado Nuestra Familia. But its other, larger segment is a wholesale distribution business that services roughly 2,300 independent grocers across the U.S. The company is several years into a turnaround plan that has helped to rejuvenate the top and bottom lines, but the stock’s performance hasn’t matched. As we said back in 2020, “a look at the past 10 years is probably a decent indication of what the next 10 will broadly look like.” SPTN boasts a decent 4%-plus yield that dwarfs most other grocers, it has raised its distribution for 15 consecutive years, and it pays out just less than half its earnings, so the dividend should have more upside. It’s hard to say the same about the stock price. Management did recently express interest in expanding its Hispanic grocery and convenience store presence, but its plans are in their infancy. BGS Foods (BGS, 10.7% yield) is the name behind brands such as Crisco, Cream of Wheat, Ortega and Bear Creek. Its double-digit yield is largely the product of a slumping stock, with shares off by more than 70% over the past few years amid slumping top and bottom lines. Its 10% return since the market top is something of a small miracle considering its continued operational woes. In late February, B&G reported it was booking charges of $320 million related to “intangible trademark assets” on its Green Giant, Victoria, Static Guard and McCann’s brands. BGS also kept its dividend at 19 cents per share, but it’s an open question as to how long B&G can keep it up. The dividend annualizes to 78 cents per share. The pros expect adjusted profits of 68 cents this year and 73 cents in 2026. Something has to give. FEMSA (FMX, 7.0% yield)—the merciful shorthand for Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V.—isn’t a familiar name, but it’s awfully interesting. FEMSA operates a huge chain of small-box retail stores, called Oxxo, in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Chile and Brazil. It uses the same brand for auto service stations in Mexico. It also operates drugstores under several names in Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador. And it owns nearly half of Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOF), the world’s largest bottler of Coca-Cola (KO) by volume. FEMSA isn’t automatically a great defensive play, then, if our worry is the U.S. economy. We have to keep our eyes on Mexico to determine FMX’s real utility. But there’s a lot to like here. It has a dominant position in Latin America. Top- and bottom-line growth hasn’t been pristine, but it’s better than many other staples names. Estimates are for 26% profit growth this year, then another 12% in 2026. The dividend itself is generous—FEMSA has become increasingly aggressive about returning capital, and it plans on paying four quarterly ordinary dividends as well as four “extraordinary” dividends, coming out to a yield of about 7%. But while FMX has been plenty fruitful, it has also been more volatile than the average staples stock, and it’s also richly priced at 20 times earnings estimates.

Title: This Event Could Be the Next Catalyst for Intel's Stock
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/this-event-could-be-the-next-catalyst-for-intel-stock-11722067
Time Published: 2025-04-26T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Shares of Intel (INTC) finished the week on a down note after its latest financial outlook disappointed investors. The stock’s next catalyst might be just a few days away. Lip-Bu Tan, who presided over the chip company’s quarterly results Thursday for the first time as CEO, will on Tuesday give the keynote address at an event associated with Intel’s Foundry business, which makes chips for other companies. Bank of America analysts in a Friday note said the event could be paired with the announcement of partnerships with other big tech firms. Intel has sought to grow the Foundry business; early last year, it spoke of ambitions to be the world’s second-largest foundry behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) by 2030. Its 2024 foundry revenue, however, fell from a year earlier—it came in north of $17 billion, roughly 30% of the company’s total—and its operating loss widened. This year reports have suggested that Intel might look to sell a stake in the Foundry operation to TSMC; that company, however, has denied talks. Investors were tracking the possibility that a spinoff or sale of Foundry might be in the works well before Tan took over. Investors continue to look for signs of dealmaking. Optimism about a range of possibilities, ranging all the way up to a sale of the entire company, has moved the shares in recent months. That could still be the case. But Tan has said cost-cutting is also a priority: On Thursday, while not formally announcing layoff plans reported earlier in the week, he made clear they are coming. Bank of America analysts, who have a neutral rating for Intel's stock and a $23 price target that is a few cents above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, said Intel is “too big to turn around quickly, but optionality [is] still there.” The stock has lost over a third of its value in the past year through Friday's close.

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap

26 April 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The compiled reports reflect a broad spectrum of Nepal’s economic and governance dynamics, highlighting issues of regulatory enforcement, infrastructure development, and investment patterns. While NEPSE saw a minor rebound after days of decline, gold prices fell by NPR 1,000 per tola, and consumers continue to bear inflated petroleum costs despite a global price slump—benefiting Nepal Oil Corporation’s profit margins. Regulatory tightening was evident with Nepal Rastra Bank penalizing financial institutions and the Insurance Authority revising foreign employment fund rules. Simultaneously, Facebook faces a registration ultimatum, while Durga Prasai’s multi-billion-rupee loan default case underscores growing scrutiny of corporate misconduct. On the legislative front, the government introduced a bill restricting Everest climbs without prior experience and restructured taxi service standards. Meanwhile, infrastructure remains a mixed picture—rapid bridge construction in Saptari contrasts with chronic delays in Achham and Bajura. In trade and investment, local goods from Humla found markets in China, and Koshi Province reached out to Indian investors. Similarly, the NRNA Australia pledged investment interest, pending a friendlier climate. Despite having sufficient domestic production, the government controversially approved areca nut imports, raising questions about policy priorities. Other highlights include Sun Nepal Life’s rights share issuance, a capped agriculture budget amid high provincial demands, and calls to upgrade critical road segments affecting tourism. Despite global political shifts, MCC aid to Nepal remains intact, reinforcing continued strategic ties with the U.S. Nepse sees minor uptick after consecutive losses The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index recorded a slight rise of 2.08 points (0.07%) on the final trading day of the week, closing at 2,658.02. After four days of steady decline, Thursday saw a mild recovery driven by increased investor activity. Out of the traded companies, shares of 83 firms rose, 161 declined, and one remained unchanged. While most sector indices dropped, the trade index climbed by 17.72 points, hydropower rose by 7.73 points, and investment increased by 2.81 points. Gold prices dropped to NPR 189,600 per tola on Friday, down from NPR 190,600 the previous day, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Silver prices held steady at NPR 2,000 per tola. On the global market, gold was trading at approximately USD 3,325 per ounce. Despite a 23.53% decline in international crude oil prices since the start of this fiscal year, the Nepal Oil Corporation has passed on minimal price reductions to consumers while posting profits of NPR 9 billion. Petrol prices have dropped by only 6.43%, while diesel, kerosene, and aviation fuel were reduced by 8.75%. The price of cooking gas has remained unchanged. MCC assistance to Nepal unaffected by U.S. political shifts Despite the re-election of Donald Trump and changes in U.S. foreign policy, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will continue its support to Nepal. According to Reuters, the Trump administration, under close ally Elon Musk, has ordered the suspension of MCC programs in most countries, except for Nepal and three others. Trump has questioned the effectiveness of such aid programs, arguing against the misuse of American taxpayer funds. Minister for Communication and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, has issued a one-week ultimatum to Meta (Facebook’s parent company) to register in Nepal. Speaking at a program organized by the National Information Commission, he warned that failure to register would result in a ban. The minister emphasized that Meta earns substantial revenue from Nepal and must comply with tax and regulatory obligations, stating that no foreign corporation can be allowed to bypass national laws. Since the Mothihari-Amlekhganj petroleum pipeline came into operation six years ago, over 57 million kiloliters (5.71 billion liters) of diesel have been imported into Nepal. The Madhesh Regional Office of Nepal Oil Corporation reports that between 1,353 to 3,568 kiloliters are imported daily. In the first nine months of the current fiscal year alone, the import volume reached 851,338 kiloliters, with daily imports averaging 2,840 kiloliters in the last fiscal year. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has taken disciplinary action against five financial institutions for breaching banking norms. These include three development banks—Mukti Nath, Narayani, and Salpa—and two finance companies—Janaki and Pokhara Finance. Among the violations, Mukti Nath’s chairman Bharat Raj Dhakal was found involved in unauthorized construction activities, leading NRB to issue an official warning. For the next fiscal year, the Ministry of Agriculture has capped the budget for new agricultural projects at NPR 1 billion across provincial and local levels. However, proposals from these governments have already exceeded NPR 30 billion. Minister Ramnath Adhikari stated that this ceiling includes funding for rural roads, markets, livestock programs, organic fertilizers, and crop improvement. The Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) of Australia has expressed its intention to increase investments in Nepal. In a meeting with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, NRNA Australia president Anil Pokhrel emphasized the desire of the Australian NRN community to invest more, provided Nepal ensures an investor-friendly environment. Discussions also included strengthening trade and economic ties, leveraging the investment framework, and enhancing bilateral cooperation between the two countries. The Nepal Insurance Authority has made a second amendment to the regulations governing the Foreign Employment Group Insurance Fund (PUL). Under the new rule, insurance companies must deposit premium records from the 1st to 15th of each month into the designated bank account by the 1st of the following month. Similar requirements apply to the second half of the month. Insurance companies must also submit details of claims and premium receipts to the fund manager, who must confirm the transactions. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has introduced new national standards for taxi services under the “National Standards for Vehicles Used as Taxis 2081,” replacing those of 2076. The updated classification divides taxis into three categories—Ordinary, Deluxe, and Luxury—based on features like size, performance, and amenities. These rules apply to all taxis, including existing and newly registered ones. A proposed provision in the new Tourism Bill 2081 bars individuals from attempting Mount Everest unless they have previously summited a 7,000-meter Himalayan peak. The bill, registered in the National Assembly by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, also requires climbers to submit health certificates. Those deemed medically unfit will be barred from mountaineering or joining climbing teams. This bill will replace the Tourism Act of 2035 B.S. At the Nepal-India Partnership Summit held in Purnia, Bihar, the Koshi Province Committee of the Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NICCI) encouraged Indian investors to consider projects in the province. Committee president Mukesh Upadhyay highlighted investment potential in tourism, agriculture, and other sectors. The event was held in collaboration with organizations like the Sub-Himalayan Research Institute and the Nepal-India Centre. Sun Nepal Life Insurance Company is set to issue 27% rights shares, totaling 10,696,320 shares at NPR 100 per share. The total value of the issue is NPR 1.07 billion. Shareholders recorded by Baishakh 4 are eligible to apply during the open window from Baishakh 30 to Jestha 19. Nepal SBI Merchant Banking is managing the rights issuance. The Gandaki chapter of the Hotel Association Nepal (HAN) has urged the government to expedite improvements along the Narayanghat-Butwal section of the East-West Highway. Chairman Hariprasad Sharma Gaire stated that delays in upgrading the road have caused significant hardship for both tourists and locals, with ongoing dust and mud making travel unpleasant. The government has permitted the import of over 11,000 tons of areca nut for the next six months, even though local production—estimated at 14,500 tons annually—is sufficient. Critics argue that the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies yielded to pressure from interest groups, especially after scrapping the import quota system last month. Six bridges have been completed in Saptari within the first nine months of the current fiscal year, and seven others are nearing completion, according to the Lahan Road Division Office. Chief Ashutosh Karna said that while load testing remains pending, these efforts aim to expand road infrastructure in the district. Notable projects include bridges on the Ghode Daha River and along the Rajbiraj-Chhinnamasta road. Despite allocating NPR 3.57 billion for 13 road projects in Achham and Bajura, delays persist across 14 out of 19 contracts awarded by the Infrastructure Development Office. Among these, two are designated as provincial pride projects. So far, NPR 1.89 billion has been spent, with NPR 573 million allocated for the current year. Deadline extensions have not resolved construction delays. Local producers in Humla have successfully exported traditional food products to Taklakot, China, under a cross-border trade agreement. Mukunda Rokaya, an entrepreneur from Simkot Municipality-6, reported that the initial shipment—featuring millet and buckwheat flour, walnut oil, and more—generated NPR 1.8 million in revenue. Controversial businessman and healthcare entrepreneur Durga Prasai is being investigated for loan defaults totaling over NPR 7 billion, related to three of his projects. Previously known for leading anti-loan repayment protests, Prasai now faces allegations of threatening bank officials, including a former NRB governor. He has been taken into police custody as investigations continue.
