Samantha Libreri Eastern Correspondent Plans aimed at preventing the railway line between south Dublin and Wicklow from falling into the sea in future years could result in major changes along parts of the eastern coastline. Irish Rail wants to place large boulders on a number of beaches and raise sea walls, blocking the view of Dublin Bay on parts of the train journey to try to stop the impact of extreme weather events and coastal erosion on the track, which has already lost lands around it of up to 30 metres over the past decade. But opponents say the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Project needs to be reconsidered. Watch: Iarnród Éireann's Cian Lynch on the rail line Iarnród Éireann said the 65km of track that runs from Merrion Gates in south Dublin to Wicklow harbour is vulnerable to the effect of storm surges and climate change. To make the rail more resilient it is planning significant interventions at five locations along the route, which include placing large boulders on a number of beaches along the east coast, including White Rock in Killiney. Project Manager of the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Project Cian Lynch said they are proposing the measures to limit disruption of services and to future proof the rail infrastructure. "In recent years, we in Irish Rail have seen more and more occurrences of wave over topping, coastal erosion along this line that necessitates more and more maintenance works, which also results in disruption for services. "As climate change takes hold, that is getting more challenging for us and we do foresee that it will impact services if we don't do something about it now. So several years ago, we took a decision to take a strategic look at this line and to provide more long term permanent protection to coastal erosion and wave over topping, and to factor in climate change as well." The plans include placing large boulders on a number of beaches and raising sea walls in places which will obscure the view of Dublin Bay along parts of the rail journey. Mr Lynch said the measures have been amended in places following an initial public consultation and are being proposed to target particular issues on each of the five locations. "It is quite a scenic and well-known piece of rail infrastructure across the world, and it's very popular for being so close to the sea, that obviously means it is quite exposed. We have just a number of issues at play. "On Killiney beach it's predominantly erosion of the embankments that supports the rail line, further north between Merrion and Seapoint it's wave overtopping and as we head further south towards Wicklow it is more of an erosion issue. So the solutions we're proposing have been adapted to suit the particular locations and to deal with the specific issues in those areas." He said part of the sea walls will be made of glass to allow for a view near some rail stations and that while the size of some beaches may be reduced due to the erection of boulders, access routes to the public will be maintained and improved in some places. 'Compromise' needs to be found However, some believe the plans need to be reconsidered. Fine Gael local representative for Blackrock Cllr Marie Baker said she believes the plans have been over engineered and do not take into account the human impact of the proposed changes. "I fear that it would mean you'll be actually in a DART with your view totally blocked of Dublin Bay and that worries me. I understand they need to secure the line into the future from climate change and storms. We've seen it in the past, unfortunately. But I think what they're proposing seems draconian, to say the least. "A little bit of the crack the nut with a big hammer. I think they need to be more conscious of people's views. I think they need to find a compromise. I can understand that we're going to lose some of our view in Dublin Bay. But do we need to lose it all? I just feel they need to interrogate that a bit more. "I think their proposal is over engineered. I think they need to think about people. There's things there that I don't think have been thought about. I think it would bring lots of sadness to people." Irish Rail said it is eager to receive feedback on the plans as part of its own public consultation which runs until 13 October. A statutory public consultation process will then follow and subject to planning permission, it hopes to begin work, which is estimated to take two to three years by 2029. These five Coastal Cell Areas make up ECRIPP, and are: · CCA1: Merrion to Dún Laoghaire · CCA2-3: Dalkey Tunnel to Shanganagh - Bray Wastewater Treatment Plant · CCA5: Bray Head to Greystones North Beach · CCA6.1: Greystones South to Newcastle · CCA6.2: Newcastle to Wicklow Chief Executive of Iarnród Éireann Jim Meade said: "To provide the best possible solution we want to hear from our neighbours and those that enjoy the coastal amenities along this route and I would urge as many people as possible to give us their feedback". Irish Rail said more details of the plans are available on its website. Eastern Correspondent © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Boutique Investment Bank BDA Cuts Jobs in China on M&A Woes

BDA Partners has cut some investment bankers in Shanghai to cope with intensifying competition in China and uncertainty over deals, people familiar with the matter said, marking the latest financial services firm to retreat from the world’s second-biggest economy. Five Shanghai-based investment bankers have been let go by the boutique firm, which focuses on mergers and acquisitions, and a couple have relocated to BDA’s Hong Kong office, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Three senior bankers are staying in Shanghai to work on existing mandates and originating new deals, the people said. BDA may also consider moving to a smaller office to cut costs, although no final decisions have been made, the people said. Founded in 1996 with offices in New York and Singapore, BDA provides Asia-focused M&A advice to global clients, mostly on small-to-mid-sized transactions, its website shows. It also has offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, Mumbai and Ho Chi Minh City, as well as London. “BDA has been in China since 1999 and we remain strongly committed to M&A across China, Hong Kong and Taiwan,” Simon Kavanagh, BDA’s head of Greater China, wrote in an emailed response to a query from Bloomberg News. “We continue active coverage of China, including having senior bankers on the ground in Hong Kong and the PRC.” While the volume of deals involving Chinese firms has grown this year, there are still plenty of challenges for advisers. They include a tightening of inbound investment, wide valuation gaps between buyers and sellers, cutthroat competition that is squeezing fees, and difficulty in getting deals finished because of geopolitical and regulatory tensions, such as with tariffs. Other investment banks, law firms and investment managers have also downsized in China. Prominent Wall Street law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP shuttered its Shanghai office last year and laid off staff. Fidelity International also planned to cut jobs in China, while Vanguard Group Inc., Van Eck Associates Corp. and Matthews International Capital Management LLC retreated too. Meanwhile, private equity firm Permira is overhauling its Asia strategy, closing offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai and shuffling senior leadership to India, where it sees stronger momentum and a more robust pipeline for deals, people familiar with the matter said earlier this year. Other alternative asset managers from KKR & Co. to Blackstone Inc. are also ramping up investments in India and elevating locally based executives to key regional roles. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: How The 30 Famous Firms In The Dow Do—Or Don’t—Create Value

BySteve Denning, Senior Contributor. Think the Dow’s 30 powerhouses are all unstoppable money machines? Think again. Some are value-destroying black holes; others are relentless value creators. The data? Ruthless. The takeaway? Crystal clear: Master these three battle-tested value principles or watch your empire crumble. These aren’t isolated hacks—they amplify each other like a chemical reaction. Nail all three? You have a chance to become a permanent value-creator. Botch them? You’re a relic like Boeing or 3M, hemorrhaging returns. Mixed bag? Expect mediocre muddling. The ultimate irony: firms laser-focused on stakeholder value make much more money than firms focused primarily on making money. To help understand the implications of the value-creating principles, the 30 firms were evaluated on each of the three principles on a scale of 1 to 5 and the scores aggregated and compared to the firm’s 10-year total return (TSR from: SeekingAlpha). 1.

The newly formed firm edged out established bidders after prediction markets and validator commitments swung heavily in its favor, capping one of the most closely watched governance decisions in crypto this year. Ethena, once considered a strong challenger, withdrew from the race on Thursday. The firm cited feedback from validators and community members questioning whether its proposal, anchored in its existing non-native infrastructure, met the spirit of the competition. Its exit further pushed prediction odds on Myriad for Native Markets above 90% and effectively cleared the path, with Paxos left trailing despite revising its proposal midweek. Disclosure: Myriad Markets is owned by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan. Despite the broad concurrence, the voting process drew criticism. Observers argued the compressed request-for-proposals timeline, combined with validator ties to existing Hyperliquid infrastructure, tilted the playing field in favor of Native Markets. Max Fiege, founder of Native Markets, outlined a phased rollout in a statement on Sunday. The first step will be the introduction of a Hyperliquid Improvement Proposal, after which mints and redeems of USDH will begin in a controlled trial. Early participants will be capped at about $800 per transaction to stress-test the system. Once initial checks are complete, the USDH/USDC spot order book will open on Hyperliquid, followed by full minting and redemption functionality for all users. With Native Market securing the USDH ticker, the closely watched governance vote “cements Hyperliquid as a fast-growing ecosystem” but also shows the “intensifying stablecoin competition,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Decrypt. Governance-led moves and fresh liquidity being poured into Hyperliquid show that “stablecoins remain central to crypto’s next phase of global adoption,” Liu added. Native Markets had been the frontrunner throughout the contest. Its proposal emphasized a native alignment with Hyperliquid: cash reserves and U.S. Treasuries managed by BlackRock off-chain. Tokenized reserves, meanwhile, will be handled on-chain by Superstate through Bridge, Stripe’s stablecoin infrastructure provider. The team also pledged to split all reserve yield equally between Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund and ecosystem growth. Backers include operators and investors with track records at Uniswap Labs, Paradigm, and Polychain. These elements, combined with early validator endorsements from groups such as CMI Trading, gave Native Markets a decisive advantage. Still, USDH’s biggest test will be “breaking through the dominance of USDC and USDT, where adoption and liquidity remain king,” Liu noted. “Transparency around reserves and strong, unified governance will be vital to win lasting trust,” with its future prospects highly dependent “on proving it can compete while maintaining stability,” he added.

Title: Asia Morning Briefing: Native Markets Wins Right to Issue USDH After Validator Vote

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Hyperliquid’s validator community has chosen Native Markets to issue USDH, ending a weeklong contest that drew proposals from Paxos, Frax, Sky (ex-MakerDAO), Agora, and others. Native Markets, co-founded by former Uniswap Labs president MC Lader, researcher Anish Agnihotri, and early Hyperliquid backer Max Fiege, said it will begin rolling out USDH “within days,” according to a post by Fiege on X. Native Markets has been awarded the USDH ticker on Hyperliquid.Thank you to all HYPE stakers and network validators for their time and effort in reviewing the proposals put forward. According to onchain trackers, Native Markets' proposal took approximately 70% of validators' votes, while Paxos took 20%, and Ethena came in at 3.2%. The staged launch starts with capped mints and redemptions, followed by a USDH/USDC spot pair before caps are lifted. USDH is designed to challenge Circle’s USDC, which currently dominates Hyperliquid with nearly $6 billion in deposits, or about 7.5% of its supply. USDC and other stablecoins will remain supported if they meet liquidity and HYPE staking requirements. Most rival bidders had promised to channel stablecoin yields back to the ecosystem with Paxos via HYPE buybacks, Frax through direct user yield, and Sky with a 4.85% savings rate plus a $25 million “Genesis Star” project. Native Markets’ pitch instead stressed credibility, trading experience, and validator alignment. BTC: BTC has recently reclaimed the $115,000 level, helped by inflows into ETFs, easing U.S. inflation data, and growing expectations for interest rate cuts. Also, technical momentum is picking up, though resistance sits around $116,000, according to CoinDesk's market insights bot. ETH: ETH is trading above $4600. The price is being buoyed by strong ETF inflows. Gold: Gold continues to trade near record highs as traders eye dollar weakness on expected Fed rate cuts.

Title: Alibaba's $100M Investment Fuels X Square Robot's Push For Embodied AI, Global Sales, And Next-Gen Humanoids

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. X Square Robot, a Shenzhen-based humanoid startup, secured approximately $100 million in funding led by Alibaba Group Holding BABA through Alibaba Cloud in a deal that strengthens the company's expansion in the robotics market. The latest investment brings the startup’s total funding to around $280 million across several financing rounds since launching in December 2023, X Square Robot Chief Operating Officer Yang Qian told CNBC earlier this week. HongShan, formerly Sequoia Capital China, joined the funding round alongside Meituan, Legend Star, Legend Capital, and INCE Capital. Qian confirmed the company is already generating revenue from sales to educational institutions, hospitality venues, and senior care facilities. Don't Miss: Venture capitalists are pouring unprecedented amounts into humanoid robotics as the integration of generative artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize human-machine interactions. X Square Robot exemplifies this trend, having completed eight funding rounds in less than two years of operation. “Right now we need robots to operate and complete complex tasks autonomously,” Yang told CNBC. She emphasized that after decades of developing robots capable of only limited functions like grasping objects, the industry has recognized that AI is essential for expanding machine capabilities. The company on Monday announced WALL-OSS, an end-to-end embodied foundation model, with code linked via GitHub and Hugging Face. The project focuses on vision-language-action alignment for manipulation tasks in real-world settings. Embodied AI here means models that perceive, reason, and act through physical systems such as robots. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share. X Square Robot also unveiled its Quanta X2 robot, featuring 360-degree cleaning capabilities with attachable mop heads and advanced hands capable of perceiving subtle pressure changes. According to CNBC, this represents a significant step toward more human-like functionality in commercial robotics applications. Currently, the company’s humanoid robots carry an $80,000 price tag according to research firm Humanoid Guide. Competitor Unitree offers a humanoid model for $16,000, though the advanced capabilities of that unit remain unclear. X Square Robot acknowledged it does not yet have a product ready for mass market delivery, with specific pricing determined by individual use cases, CNBC reported. Yang expects consumer adoption to accelerate once robot prices drop to approximately $10,000, achieved primarily through hardware cost reductions. She projects this milestone is achievable within three to five years, coinciding with the X Square Robot's prediction that “robotic butlers” will become reality within the same timeframe. See Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It The startup plans to begin preparing for an initial public offering next year, though Yang noted the company has not determined the listing location. X Square Robot is already expanding internationally, with ongoing discussions with potential customers in Japan and Singapore. Yang acknowledged that AI for robotics currently lags behind generative AI advancements in chatting and code generation. She estimates robotic AI technology will require at least 12 months to achieve ChatGPT 3.5-type capabilities, noting that “embodied AI” lacks clear benchmarks for measuring relative progress. While X Square Robot utilizes Nvidia NVDA chips for computing functions, other operations rely on less powerful automotive chips that can be sourced domestically within China, Yang told CNBC. This hybrid approach provides the company with supply chain flexibility as it scales operations to meet growing demand across educational, hospitality, and healthcare sectors.

Title: ROSEN, NATIONAL INVESTOR RIGHTS COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

September 14, 2025 14:45 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Bitcoin – Not Big Tech – Is The Market’s Biggest Story, Michael Saylor Says

Strategy’s stock and treasury moves have grabbed fresh attention after the company’s executive chairman compared the firm’s returns to those of the so-called Magnificent 7 tech giants. Short and blunt: Strategy has leaned hard into Bitcoin, and recent numbers make a striking case. According to posts by Michael Saylor, Strategy now holds about 638,460 BTC following a purchase of 1,955 BTC at an average price near 111,196. The company has spent roughly $47 billion, fees included, to build that stack at an average buy price of $73,880. Based on reports, the current value of those holdings is about $71 billion. Those figures sit at the center of Saylor’s argument that his firm’s balance sheet strategy has paid off in ways typical tech plays have not. Saylor also shared a chart that matched open interest against market capitalization. Strategy topped that metric at 100%, while Tesla registered 26%. The rest of the Magnificent 7 — Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft — came in well below Strategy’s reading. According to his post, this comparison underpins the claim that Strategy’s market dynamics tied to Bitcoin have outpaced many heavyweight tech names. What’s your Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7? pic.twitter.com/wywaAij3Rs — Michael Saylor (@saylor) September 13, 2025 Based on reports, each of those big tech firms is dealing with different pressures. Apple and Microsoft face tougher regulatory checks. Amazon is seeing slower consumer demand. Tesla must contend with rising competition in electric vehicles. Nvidia remains a strong performer because of AI chip demand, but even Nvidia’s run this year has not matched its earlier explosive gains. Annualized returns presented by Saylor put Strategy at 91%, Nvidia at 72%, Tesla at 32%, Alphabet at 26%, and Meta at 23%. Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon showed significantly lower annualized gains in that comparison. Reports have disclosed that about 12 companies upped their Bitcoin holdings last week, led by Strategy’s 1,955 BTC purchase. Gemini added 1,191 BTC and Bitdeer took on 333.5 BTC. Companies from Japan’s Metaplanet to China’s Cango and the US firm Volcon also added coins. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the 100 largest public holders now control 1,009,202 BTC, which is valued at more than $117 billion today. “What’s your Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7?” Saylor asked on X, hinting that Bitcoin—and his company’s bold treasury bet—may offer the answer. Whether investors see it as a challenge or a warning depends on how they weigh Bitcoin exposure against traditional tech growth.

The #1 WordPress Theme & Visual Page Builder Harness the Power of Divi With Any Theme The Best Theme for Bloggers and Online Publications The Ultimate Email Opt-In Plugin for WordPress The Best Way To Promote Social Sharing Forgot Your Username or Password? Posted on September 14, 2025 by Deanna McLean Leave a Comment Compatibility with WooCommerce has now been expanded to Divi 5, giving you full control over product pages without relying on WooCommerce’s built-in templates. The newly-integrated WooCommerce Product Modules let you design engaging, user-friendly layouts that match your brand and help boost sales, while tapping into all of Divi 5’s features, including Flexbox, to build product pages with modern layout control. In this post, we’ll cover the modules’ key features and show you how to use them for your next Divi 5 ecommerce website. Let’s dive in. Woo Product Modules are specialized content elements within Divi 5, designed to customize product and category pages for Woo-powered stores. These modules replace the WooCommerce templates that come standard with the plugin, enabling you to create customizable layouts. Unlike these traditional templates, Divi 5’s modules allow creative freedom while maintaining compatibility with WooCommerce’s core functionality. The release of 17 WooCommerce Modules in Divi 5 marks a significant milestone. These modules, which cover all product and category page design aspects, are no longer in legacy mode, meaning they are all fully optimized for Divi 5’s modern architecture. With this transition to a more efficient foundation, Divi 5 performs better, is more scalable, and is compatible with the future of WordPress. The remaining 8 Woo Modules, focused on cart and checkout pages, are expected to roll out soon. Let’s go over the key features that you can expect now that the WooCommerce Product Modules have been integrated into Divi 5. The first batch of Divi 5’s WooCommerce Product Modules includes tools designed to handle a specific aspect of product and category page design. These modules are: Together, these modules provide everything you need to build product and category pages, from navigational breadcrumbs to dynamic product displays. Divi 5’s WooCommerce Product Modules free users from the constraints of standard WooCommerce Templates. With these modules, you can fully control your product pages’ layout, structure, and design, creating unique experiences. The modules support dynamic content, meaning they pull product data directly from WooCommerce, ensuring real-time updates for prices, stock levels, and descriptions. This allows you to build pages that drive engagement and conversions without requiring third-party plugins or custom code. Each module has extensive design settings, all manageable within the Visual Builder. You can customize elements like product galleries, sale badges, buttons, and more with options for typography, colors, spacing, and animations. For example, you can adjust the layout of the Woo Product Gallery module to display images in a slider or grid, style the Woo Product Add to Cart button with custom colors and hover effects, or tweak the Woo Product Rating module to align star ratings perfectly with your design. These settings let you create cohesive, branded store pages with ease. Divi 5’s Theme Builder lets you embrace the full potential of WooCommerce Product Modules by allowing you to create global templates for product and category pages. With Theme Builder, you can design a single template that applies to all of the products and categories in your store, ensuring a consistent, cohesive look. The Divi 5 Loop Builder offers an alternative way to build dynamic Woo content. With Loop Builder, you can query WooCommerce products and design flexible product loops using any Divi element, creating layouts, lists, and carousels that go beyond the fixed structure of dedicated product modules. For single-product layouts, use the Woo Product Modules; for product collections and archives, use the Loop Builder. This section will walk you through creating a product page in Divi 5’s Theme Builder using the new WooCommerce Product Modules. Navigate to Divi > Theme Builder in the WordPress dashboard. Click on + Add New Template. Click Build New Template when the dialog box appears. Next, we’ll need to assign our template to our products. Under Products, select All Products to assign the template. Click Create Template to assign it. Click Add Custom Body. This will allow us to build the body of our product page template. Choose Build Custom Body when the dialog box appears. When the Theme Builder launches, you can build a template from scratch, choose a premade layout, or build with AI. We’ll select Build From Scratch for this tutorial. Click the green + icon to add a new row. When the options appear, choose the two-column row. New rows you add to any Divi 5 page or template will use Flebox by default. Divi 5’s Flexbox Layout System gives you more control over how your product pages look than ever, including changing how your WooCommerce Product Modules stack across different screen sizes. Scroll down to reveal the Woo Product Modules option. Once clicked, you’ll have 17 Divi 5 Woo modules and 8 legacy (Divi 4) modules. Find and select the Woo Product Images module and add it to the first column. This Post is selected by default in the Product field in the Content tab. If you’d like to build the template using an existing product, choose it from the dropdown menu. This is a great way to preview how your template will look while creating it. Remember to swap it back to This Post before the final save. Expand the Elements dropdown menu to reveal the settings. Here, you can control which images display in the module, including the featured image, gallery images, and sale badge. Click the Image dropdown menu in the Design tab to reveal the settings. Here, you can force the image to occupy all the available space (force fullwidth), add a border, box shadow, adjust spacing, or add filters. You can also style the Sale Badge by assigning a background color, text, borders, and more. In the 2nd column, click Woo Product Modules and scroll to select the Woo Product Title module. Use the dropdown menu in the Product field of the Content tab to select a product and preview how it will look in the template. Next, navigate to the module’s Design tab and expand the Title Text dropdown menu. Here, you can assign a font and style the heading as you’d like. Under the product title, click to add a new module. Select the Woo Product Modules and scroll to select the Woo Product Price Module. In the Design tab, you can style every aspect of the product’s price, including the text, sale text, new price text, and more. Next, we’ll add the Woo Product Rating Module under the Woo Price Module. In the Content tab under Elements, you can choose to show or hide the star rating and customer reviews count. In the Design tab, the Layout dropdown menu lets you choose how to display the star rating. Elements can be displayed inline or stacked. Other styling options include assigning a color, text size, and letter spacing for the stars and styling options for the rating text. Under the Woo Star Rating Module, click to add a new Woo Module. This time, we’ll select the Woo Product Description Module. In the Content tab, choose which description to display (description or short description). In the Design tab, you can style the description with options for font, weight, style, alignment, color, size, and more. Next, we’ll add the Woo Product Add to Cart Module. It will allow your customers to add the product to their carts and choose any variations assigned to the product. The Elements toggles in the Content tab allow you to show or hide the quantity field and available stock. Quick note: For the stock quantity to display, you must check manage stock in the Woo product itself. You can style the field labels, text, dropdown menus (for variations), and the button to match your branding in the Design tab. Continue adding modules, like the Woo Product Meta Module to display SKU numbers and categories. You can also add the Woo Product Tabs Module to display a description, reviews, and additional info about your product. For maximum reach, you can display a series of Related Products on your product template to encourage your site’s visitors to explore additional products in your store, increasing the chance of a conversion. Once finished adding modules, make any additional changes you need, and then save the template by clicking on the Save button at the top right corner of the Theme Builder. Next, click the Exit button to return to the Theme Builder dashboard. Back in the Theme Builder dashboard, click Save Changes to save the template and apply it to your Woo products. As you can see, creating a product template with Divi 5’s Woo Product Modules is a simple process. We won’t cover all modules in this tutorial, but using all of them, you can create impressive product or category pages that keep your visitors engaged. Join the Divi Newsletter and we will email you a copy of the ultimate Divi Landing Page Layout Pack, plus tons of other amazing and free Divi resources, tips and tricks. Follow along and you will be a Divi master in no time. If you are already subscribed simply type in your email address below and click download to access the layout pack. The second batch of WooCommerce Modules, focusing on cart and checkout pages, will be released in the next few weeks, wrapping up the integration with WooCommerce. These additions will enable users to fully customize the entire ecommerce funnel, from product browsing to checkout. The Divi 5 Public Beta will refine these features further, incorporating user feedback and additional bug fixes to ensure stability. Beyond WooCommerce compatibility and integration, Divi 5 continues to evolve with recent features like the Group Carousel Module for creating dynamic product sliders, the Lottie Module for adding lightweight animations, and a new Flexbox Layout System for enhanced layout control. These additions complement the Woo modules, offering even more creative possibilities for ecommerce sites. Divi 5‘s Woo Product Modules allow you to create captivating product and category pages with unparalleled flexibility and creativity. The modules offer a blend of creative freedom, dynamic content integration, and performance, all within an intuitive interface.

India's CSR regime, a significant source of social funding, has primarily focused on education, health, and rural development. However, it overlooks policy research, crucial for achieving true self-reliance. Increased CSR investment in think tanks and R&D could boost innovation, competitiveness, and effective governance, strengthening India's intellectual sovereignty and supporting national priorities.

Title: Proxy firm critics say they’re calling the shots in corporate America

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here. Lawmakers in Washington are sounding the alarm over little-known shareholder watchdogs that they say are quietly shaping decisions at the nation’s largest companies. The two players at the center of the storm are Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, which dominate nearly the entire proxy advisory market. Both companies play an outsize role in guiding how major institutional investors such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street vote on everything from executive pay and board seats to hot-button policies tied to climate policy and workplace diversity. What started as a simple “cheat sheet” for busy investors has, according to critics, morphed into a system where ISS and Glass Lewis effectively steer corporate decision-making. That influence boiled over at a heated House hearing last week, where Republicans accused the firms of acting like unelected regulators. Much of the fight centers on Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act, which lays out the process for shareholders to put proposals on a company’s proxy ballot. Republicans say the rule has been stretched far beyond its intent, enabling activists to force votes on divisive social issues that have little to do with shareholder value. Democrats counter that 14a-8 is one of the few tools ordinary investors have to hold corporate boards accountable. Rep. French Hill (R-AK), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, argued the firms’ influence has ballooned in recent decades, raising doubts about whether they still serve investors. “We’ve seen the shareholder proposal process diverted away from the critical business strategy focus and instead become a tool for advancing proposals to distract from companies’ missions, leading to an erosion of shareholder value and costly burdens on companies,” Hill said during the hearing on Wednesday. Other Republicans piled on, saying the proposal process has been hijacked. Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) pointed out a Cummins proposal to link executive pay to climate goals, a diversity, equity, and inclusion data-reporting resolution at Eli Lilly, and a request at Coca-Cola for a report on the risks the company faces from state abortion restrictions. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-MI) was more blunt: “Two proxy firms should not be deciding how trillions of dollars in shareholders’ votes are cast.” Shareholder activism has already left its mark on some of the country’s best-known companies. After repeated pressure from investors, Amazon agreed to conduct a racial equity audit of its workforce practices, a move overseen by an outside law firm. Tesla’s $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk became another flashpoint, with both Glass Lewis and ISS urging shareholders to vote it down. Another corporate heavyweight, JPMorgan Chase, faced proposals demanding more detailed disclosures about its fossil-fuel financing, while companies such as Coca-Cola and McDonald’s have been pressed on workplace policies ranging from abortion access to gender-affirming care. Stutzman said the trend underscores how a small group of activists can use proxy firms to drive corporate agendas. “I’m a free market guy, and I believe companies need to be able to pursue their mission, not be socially directed by a small group of shareholders,” he told the Washington Examiner. “These firms are the ones that are the real financial winners, and the companies are the ones that have to navigate issues they don’t really want to deal with.” Critics warn that big asset managers can push companies into cultural fights. BlackRock, which owns nearly 15% of Cracker Barrel, often follows guidance from ISS and Glass Lewis. Last month, the chain dropped its famous “Old Timer” logo for a new look, drawing fierce backlash from customers, conservative critics, and even President Donald Trump. Within weeks, Cracker Barrel reversed course. “If they want to rebrand themselves and say, ‘This is who we are,’ fine. But customers will let them know very quickly if they don’t like it,” Stutzman said, noting that Jaguar Land Rover’s CEO faced similar criticism, stepping down after a rebrand critics derided as “woke.” Democrats countered that Republicans exaggerated the firms’ sway and misrepresented how the shareholder process works. Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL), former CEO of Turbosteam Corporation, dismissed the hearing as “really dumb” and accused Republicans of inventing a “boogeyman that doesn’t exist.” He stressed that shareholder proposals are strictly advisory, not binding, and said it was misleading to suggest proxy advisers could dictate corporate decisions. “Shareholders are actually the people who own companies … executives serve at their pleasure. They are custodians of shareholders’ investment, but they are not actually the people in charge,” Casten said. “This is not freaking complicated … the law says [shareholder proposals] are advisory. They get factored in, and then we have a high-functioning board.” New York City comptroller Brad Lander, who testified as a witness, emphasized that shareholder proposals are essential tools for accountability and long-term value. Lander, who oversees $300 billion in pension assets, pointed to past campaigns on executive pay clawbacks, insider trading, and board access that began as shareholder resolutions and later became standard practice or Securities and Exchange Commission policy. “These tools help protect the retirement security of New York City’s teachers, cops, firefighters, and nurses,” he said. “Shareholder proposals and engagement strengthen accountability and ensure that U.S. markets remain the most trusted and resilient in the world. Let’s not screw that up.” Lawmakers also raised alarms about who owns the proxy advisory giants. ISS, founded in Maryland in the 1980s, is now majority-owned by Deutsche Börse Group, the German exchange operator that runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Glass Lewis was acquired in 2021 by Peloton Capital Management, a Toronto-based private equity fund. The two firms control about 97% of the U.S. proxy advisory market. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) questioned why such influential players have never been reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which screens foreign takeovers for national security risks. “In a world where we’re laser-focused on foreign influence in critical sectors like tech and infrastructure, why aren’t we properly screening foreign companies that control corporate governance in our country?” he asked, warning that European or Canadian ownership could import different political priorities into U.S. boardrooms. Witnesses echoed those concerns, pointing to the influence of European-style “double materiality” standards, which consider both a company’s effect on the outside world and on shareholders, in proxy adviser recommendations. “They’re inappropriately importing European standards of investing into the standards they are then imposing in the recommendations they give to companies … applying an entirely different investment theory to U.S. companies,” said Ferrell Keel, a partner at Jones Day. Ron Mueller of Gibson Dunn added that the shareholder proposal process has become professionalized, with advisers “not just asking for information. They’re trying to influence outcomes.” The firms reject the charge that they wield unchecked power. ISS pushed back on the criticism, stressing that it does not control which proposals appear on corporate ballots or how investors ultimately vote. “Corporations and their investors … make those choices,” a spokesman said in a statement to the Washington Examiner, adding that ISS provides “rigorous, fact-based research, analysis, and recommendations” based on clients’ voting policies. The firm also noted that it is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act and said a framework for regulating proxy voting advice already exists. Glass Lewis declined to comment. The debate over how to check that influence now shifts to regulators and the courts. Federal regulators have wrestled with how far to go in policing the industry. In 2020, the SEC adopted rules aimed at adding transparency and giving companies a chance to rebut proxy firm recommendations. Two years later, former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler reversed course, rolling back those measures. More recently, a federal appeals court narrowed the agency’s reach even further, ruling that proxy advice does not count as a “solicitation” under federal law, a decision that limits the commission’s ability to regulate the firms. States have tried to wade in as well. In Texas, a new law requiring proxy advisers to disclose when their recommendations relied on “non-financial factors” such as environmental, social, and governance considerations was set to take effect Sept. 1. However, on Aug. 29, a federal judge granted ISS and Glass Lewis a preliminary injunction, siding with their argument that the statute violated the First Amendment by compelling speech, among other claims. A source familiar with the agency’s thinking said legislative changes that explicitly authorize the SEC to regulate proxy advisers under the Exchange Act would be the most effective fix. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has long been critical of proxy firms, and the source added that the commission shares lawmakers’ and industry groups’ concerns about the firms’ influence and lack of accountability. LAWMAKERS DEMAND OVERSIGHT OF PROXY GIANTS DRIVING ESG IN CORPORATE AMERICA That tug-of-war has sharpened calls in Congress for a legislative fix, especially after recent court decisions. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI) told the committee he has repeatedly introduced bills to rein in what he called the “duopoly” of ISS and Glass Lewis, arguing both firms should be held to stricter disclosure standards. Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) promoted her Corporate Governance Examination Act, which would require the SEC to study the proxy process regularly to guard against what she described as “unnecessary politicization.” But Lander cautioned that rolling back shareholder rights would backfire. He noted that past proposals helped drive reforms later codified by the SEC. New limits, he warned, could “gut” accountability tools that protect long-term investor value.

Title: TSM-Bee? TSMC gets into the honey business after working with local beekeepers to establish hives around its fabs

TSMC branded honey is available in several flavors, depending on the flora around a particular fab. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. TSMC has worked with local beekeepers in Taiwan to produce ‘Ji Mi’ – TSMC branded honey. The production of this golden, viscous, and culinary important liquid has become possible around the world’s largest contract chipmaker fabs in Taiwan thanks to extensive environmental and sustainability efforts by the company. Sources: Liberty Times and Mirror Daily (machine translated). On Friday, TSMC presented at the ‘2025 Asia Pacific Sustainability Expo - Co-Prosperity x Growth Forum.’ At the event, its SVP of Corporate Sustainability, Ho Li-mei, claimed TSMC's commitment to ecological integration has reaped very worthwhile, and some surprising, dividends. The prime example, as per our headline, is that bees have returned to the local ecosystem around TSMC’s massive manufacturing facilities. Bees came naturally after the restoration of plant species chosen for their suitability, after environmental surveys. Now TSMC is collaborating with local beekeepers and Tunghai University to produce TSMC-exclusive honey – ‘Ji Mi.’ Other signs that nature’s balance has been restored around TSMC fabs are the return of native Taiwanese species like the silver goby in waters around the plants. It is also claimed that TSMC is the first semiconductor producer in Taiwan to have fireflies living on the site. Fireflies are notoriously fussy about the environments they inhabit in Taiwan. Tom’s Hardware regulars will be aware of TSMC’s previous concerns about water supplies. This resource pressure, and the need for TSMC to be particularly eco-friendly, given Taiwan’s rather small size, may have been instrumental to the surprising eco-dividends we are now seeing around its fabs. At the Expo, Ho Li-mei mentioned that TSMC has made major inroads in managing precious resources in the water-intensive semiconductor industry. Thanks to specialized resource management, water recycling at new facilities has been increased to over 90%, it is claimed. As resources are carefully conserved, semiconductor manufacturing waste is being reduced to the minimum. The source reports note that TSMC's waste recycling rate is as high as 97%, and less than 1% of waste in Taiwan is landfilled. Moreover, a modern ‘Zero Waste Center’ in Taichung has been successful at converting waste into electronic-grade raw materials – advancing the circular economy.

UP to 1,000 jobs are set to be created in Belfast by Bank of America, the world's second-largest bank. American multinational Citigroup is also set to grow its presence in Northern Ireland, where the bank currently employs several thousand people. The plans were announced yesterday by Britain's Department for Business and Trade (DBT) as part of a £1.25bn investment into the financial services sector by a raft of leading US firms, which also includes BlackRock, PayPal and S&P Global. As well as Belfast, some of the companies are set to expand operations and open new offices all across Britain, with London, Edinburgh and Manchester set to gain from a wave of skilled job creation. "These investments will create thousands of high-skilled jobs from Belfast to Edinburgh, kickstarting the growth that is essential to putting money in working people's pockets across every part of the United Kingdom," said Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves. The news of Bank of America's investment marks the company's first-ever operation in Northern Ireland, a major milestone that underscores the region's growing role in global financial services. Brian Moynihan, Chair and CEO of the company, said: "At Bank of America we are focused on helping our clients advance economic opportunity and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. "The early US-UK trade agreement that the President and the Prime Minister began discussing in February has provided the business community with the certainty and framework it needs to strengthen transatlantic commerce. "We are pleased to be able to extend Bank of America's investment in the UK with the creation of a new Belfast operations facility to support our global business, bringing up to 1,000 new opportunities to Northern Ireland." Citigroup are investing £1.1bn into Britain, its second-largest market globally. It employs 14,000 people across Britain working across four main sites — London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. Citibank, the group's primary subsidiary, has invested heavily in the refurbishment of its Canary Wharf headquarters and continues to invest in its Northern Ireland operations. The bank is already one of the top employers in Belfast, now employing more than 4,000 people there, firmly establishing the city as a major technology powerhouse. "Citi's commitment to the UK runs deep," said Jane Fraser, Citi Group CEO. "This is home to many of our most senior leaders and nearly 14,000 colleagues across London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. "We're proud to be serving 85 per cent of the FTSE 100 and to have stood beside UK companies through every market cycle, raising capital, financing growth and helping them compete on the world stage. "The UK isn't simply one of our largest markets; it is core to Citi's foundation as a truly global bank. "The UK-US investment relationship has never been stronger, with over £1.2tn invested in each other's countries at the end of 2023."

Title: Why We Need the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: A Legal Shield Against the Censorship Industrial Complex
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-09-14-why-we-need-the-charlie-kirk-free-speech-act.html
Time Published: 2025-09-14T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
The First Amendment was designed to protect all speechâespecially unpopular speechâfrom government tyranny. Yet today, Google, Facebook, Twitter (X), YouTube, Wikipedia, corporate media, and universities operate as de facto arms of the government, colluding with the DHS, DoD, CIA, and foreign NGOs to blacklist, deplatform, and economically destroy anyone who challenges the official narrative. This is not hyperbole. Smoking-gun documents from lawsuits like Missouri v. Biden and Brighteon v. Google (et al) prove that the U.S. government has been laundering censorship requests through overseas NGOs to bypass constitutional protections. People like myself, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and now Charlie Kirkâall have been systematically erased from digital public squares simply for expressing views that contradict the pharmaceutical-industrial complex, the climate cult, the LGBTQ indoctrination agenda, or the military-industrial war machine. Enough is enough. It is time for Congress to pass the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Actâa landmark law that would: - Outlaw viewpoint discrimination on all large platforms (1M+ users). - Fine violators $1 billion per day for algorithmic or manual censorship of protected speech. - Explicitly protect political, medical, scientific, religious, and anti-government speech. - Establish a $1 trillion compensation fund for victims of censorship over the past decade. - Criminally prosecute executives who engage in systematic suppression of free expression. This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The First Amendment was designed to protect all speechâespecially unpopular speechâfrom government tyranny. Yet today, Google, Facebook, Twitter (X), YouTube, Wikipedia, corporate media, and universities operate as de facto arms of the government, colluding with the DHS, DoD, CIA, and foreign NGOs to blacklist, deplatform, and economically destroy anyone who challenges the official narrative. This is not hyperbole. Smoking-gun documents from lawsuits like Missouri v. Biden and Brighteon v. Google (et al) prove that the U.S. government has been laundering censorship requests through overseas NGOs to bypass constitutional protections. People like myself, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and now Charlie Kirkâall have been systematically erased from digital public squares simply for expressing views that contradict the pharmaceutical-industrial complex, the climate cult, the LGBTQ indoctrination agenda, or the military-industrial war machine. Enough is enough. It is time for Congress to pass the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Actâa landmark law that would: - Outlaw viewpoint discrimination on all large platforms (1M+ users). - Fine violators $1 billion per day for algorithmic or manual censorship of protected speech. - Explicitly protect political, medical, scientific, religious, and anti-government speech. - Establish a $1 trillion compensation fund for victims of censorship over the past decade. - Criminally prosecute executives who engage in systematic suppression of free expression. This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible.

The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Enough is enough. It is time for Congress to pass the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Actâa landmark law that would: - Outlaw viewpoint discrimination on all large platforms (1M+ users). - Fine violators $1 billion per day for algorithmic or manual censorship of protected speech. - Explicitly protect political, medical, scientific, religious, and anti-government speech. - Establish a $1 trillion compensation fund for victims of censorship over the past decade. - Criminally prosecute executives who engage in systematic suppression of free expression. This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police.

After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

It is time for Congress to pass the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Actâa landmark law that would: - Outlaw viewpoint discrimination on all large platforms (1M+ users). - Fine violators $1 billion per day for algorithmic or manual censorship of protected speech. - Explicitly protect political, medical, scientific, religious, and anti-government speech. - Establish a $1 trillion compensation fund for victims of censorship over the past decade. - Criminally prosecute executives who engage in systematic suppression of free expression.

After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1.

The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3.

Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day.

The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3.

Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media).

Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3.

To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads.

Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine.

Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day.

Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives.

This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day. Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2.

Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives.

The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late.

Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3.

Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America.

Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours.

Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives.

Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2.

Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives.

Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny.

Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America.

This agreement aims to bolster collaboration between the two nations' trillion-dollar tech sectors, enhancing opportunities for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. While the final details were still being negotiated, the embassy said the partnership will focus on key technologies, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, telecommunications, and quantum computing. “Cutting-edge technology such as AI and quantum computing will transform our lives,” UK Technology Secretary Liz Kendall, who was appointed to her role on September 5, said in a statement. Trump is set to fly to the UK on Tuesday for a second state visit, which is expected to last three days. He is due to be accompanied by a delegation of US executives including Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI's Sam Altman. BlackRock plans to invest $700 million in British data centers as part of a string of deals to be announced during Trump's state visit next week, Sky News reported on Saturday. Since the start of the year, both countries have published AI Action Plans. US firms such as Anthropic and OpenAI are increasingly establishing international offices in London, while UK-based companies like DeepMind continue to invest in trans-Atlantic collaborations.

Title: Goldman Sachs Warns An AI Slowdown Can Tank The Stock Market By 20%

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to all-time highs, but Goldman Sachs GS recently warned that once AI spending slows down, the stock market can tank by 20%. A research note from Goldman Sachs Analyst Ryan Hammond cited the danger of hyperscalers inevitably cutting back on AI expenditures, according to Fortune. "A reversion of long-term growth estimates back to early 2023 levels would imply 15% to 20% downside to the current valuation multiple of the S&P 500," Hammond reportedly wrote in his research note. Don't Miss: Right now, AI spending is full steam ahead, but Hammond wrote that a few analysts are assuming that a sharp deceleration will take place in Q4 2025 and 2026. Tech giants haven't gotten the memo. Meta Platforms META said this week it will spend $600 billion on AI over the next three years. Zuckerberg later posted on Threads that it's possible the company will invest more than $600 billion during those three years. He even said a "significantly higher number" was likely through the end of the decade. Microsoft MSFT made another big AI deal this week by securing a five-year, $17.4 billion AI infrastructure deal with Nebius NBIS. This type of rapid spending indicates AI growth can continue beyond the current rally. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share. Artificial intelligence plays a critical role in the stock market's performance based on the top companies in major benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Data from Slickchart shows that top AI beneficiary Nvidia NVDA makes up approximately 7% of the S&P 500. The top eight publicly traded corporations on the S&P 500 are all heavily invested in artificial intelligence. They are ramping up their AI spending and aim to release products and services that use AI. These eight companies make up more than 36% of the S&P 500. There are also corporate giants outside of the S&P 500's top 10 that still invest heavily in artificial intelligence. Oracle ORCL, Palantir PLTR, and Cisco CSCO are some of the most notable S&P 500 members in the category. Those three stocks make up more than 2% of the S&P 500 combined, and if they continue to outpace stocks with less of a focus on AI, then the technology's influence on the stock market will continue to grow. If the AI trade fades, many stocks will lose value and drag the S&P 500 considerably lower from its current levels. See Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It It's almost never a good idea to sell stocks just because of headlines or what an analyst says in a research note. However, Hammond reportedly brings up a point that some investors are ignoring. What if AI spending eventually slows down? There's only so much money and profits big tech can spend on AI, so growth rates will eventually have to decrease. It can still take a few years before a meaningful slowdown in the growth of AI spending, and decelerating growth rates don't necessarily translate into big tech pulling out of AI spending completely. Investors should consider the bullish and bearish points of any of their positions. While the stock market is exuberant on AI and its long-term potential, it's good to consider the possible downside of any slowdowns in AI spending.

Over £1.25bn in US investment has been pledged to the UK financial services sector ahead of Donald Trump's second state visit, promising thousands of new jobs and stronger trade ties. Sunday 14 September 2025 05:12, UK The UK government has announced more than £1.25bn in private US investment in the UK's financial services sector ahead of US President Donald Trump's second state visit. The new US investments are expected to create 1,800 jobs and boost benefits for millions of customers across the country, the UK government said. The deal secures £20bn in trade between the two nations - including an expected £7bn commitment from BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. It is set to deliver more than £8bn in investment and capital commitments to the UK, with over £12bn flowing in the other direction - creating jobs and opportunities on both sides. Other companies expected to invest include PayPal, Bank of America, Citi, and S&P Global. Bank of America will create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast as part of its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland, the government said. Citi plans to invest £1.1bn across its UK operations, while S&P Global will create 200 permanent jobs in Manchester through a £4m investment. US court rules Trump's tariffs are illegal - but leaves them in place for now Redundancies begin at UK's largest bioethanol plant after government rejects bailout US and China extend tariffs deadline again "Strengthening ties with the US boosts our economy, creates jobs, and secures our role in global finance," Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said. "These investments reflect the strength of our enduring 'golden corridor' with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the US Presidential State Visit." Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said that the commitment from America's leading financial institutions "demonstrates the immense potential of the UK economy", as well as "our strong relationship with the US". The UK and US agreed a "landmark" economic deal in May, which secured major tariff reductions for key sectors and protected jobs in the automotive and aerospace sectors. Discussions are ongoing with the US on a broader UK-US economic deal, aimed at increasing digital trade and strengthening supply chains. MPs urge pressure on US over tariffs ahead of Trump visit MPs have urged the government to apply maximum pressure on the US to obtain tariff relief ahead of Donald Trump's state visit. The Commons Business and Trade Committee described the upcoming visit as a crucial opportunity to push the US president to finalise the remaining terms of the economic prosperity deal. While the UK and US reached a trade agreement in June that lowered tariffs on car and aerospace exports to the US, negotiations on British steel tariffs remain unresolved, keeping them at 25%. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Read more from Sky News:BlackRock to invest £500m in UK data centres during Trump visitZero growth in July as economy 'continued to slow' Committee chairman Liam Byrne said the state visit is "no mere pageant". "We can't escape the truth that Britain now trades with its biggest partner on terms that are worse than the past, the EU has in places secured a better edge, and key sectors of our economy still face the peril of new tariffs. That means jobs hang in the balance and investment waits on certainty." The committee also called on the government to finalise agreements on aluminium and pharmaceuticals, ensuring that the terms accurately reflect the UK's supply chain dynamics and its shift toward low-carbon production.

A government spokesperson said the "special relationship" between the UK and the US "remains strong" and that "thanks to our trade deal, the UK is still the only country to have avoided 50% steel and aluminium tariffs". "We will work with the US to implement this landmark deal as soon as possible to give industry the security they need, protect vital jobs, and put more money in people's pockets," the government spokesperson said, adding, "as well as welcoming the president on this historic state visit."

Fortunes are made by entrepreneurs and investors when revolutionary technologies enable waves of innovative, investable companies. Think of the railroad, the Bessemer process, electric power, the internal combustion engine, or the microprocessor—each of which, like a stray spark in a fireworks factory, set off decades of follow-on innovations, permeated every part of society, and catapulted a new set of inventors and investors into power, influence, and wealth. Yet some technological innovations, though societally transformative, generate little in the way of new wealth; instead, they reinforce the status quo. Fifteen years before the microprocessor, another revolutionary idea, shipping containerization, arrived at a less propitious time, when technological advancement was a Red Queen’s race, and inventors and investors were left no better off for non-stop running. Anyone who invests in the new new thing must answer two questions: First, how much value will this innovation create? And second, who will capture it? Information and communication technology (ICT) was a revolution whose value was captured by startups and led to thousands of newly rich founders, employees, and investors. In contrast, shipping containerization was a revolution whose value was spread so thin that in the end, it made only a single founder temporarily rich and only a single investor a little bit richer. Is generative AI more like the former or the latter? Will it be the basis of many future industrial fortunes, or a net loser for the investment community as a whole, with a few zero-sum winners here and there? There are ways to make money investing in the fruits of AI, but they will depend on assuming the latter—that it is once again a less propitious time for inventors and investors, that AI model builders and application companies will eventually compete each other into an oligopoly, and that the gains from AI will accrue not to its builders but to customers. A lot of the money pouring into AI is therefore being invested in the wrong places, and aside from a couple of lucky early investors, those who make money will be the ones with the foresight to get out early. The microprocessor was revolutionary, but the people who invented it at Intel in 1971 did not see it that way—they just wanted to avoid designing desktop calculator chipsets from scratch every time. But outsiders realized they could use the microprocessor to build their own personal computers, and enthusiasts did. Thousands of tinkerers found configurations and uses that Intel never dreamed of. This distributed and permissionless invention kicked off a “great surge of development,” as the economist Carlota Perez calls it, triggered by technology but driven by economic and societal forces.[1] There was no real demand for personal computers in the early 1970s; they were expensive toys. But the experimenters laid the technical groundwork and built a community. Then, around 1975, a step-change in the cost of microprocessors made the personal computer market viable. The Intel 8080 had an initial list price of $360 ($2,300 in today’s dollars). MITS could barely turn a profit on its Altair at a bulk price of $75 each ($490 today). But when MOS Technologies started selling its 6502 for $25 ($150 today), Steve Wozniak could afford to build a prototype Apple. The 6502 and the similarly priced Zilog Z80 forced Intel’s prices down. The nascent PC community started spawning entrepreneurs and a score of companies appeared, each with a slightly different product. You couldn’t have known in the mid-1970s that the PC (and PC-like products, such as ATMs, POS terminals, smartphones, etc.) would revolutionize everything. While Steve Jobs was telling investors that every household would someday have a personal computer (a wild underestimate, as it turned out), others questioned the need for personal computers at all. As late as 1979, Apple’s ads didn’t tell you what a personal computer could do—it asked what you did with it.[2] The established computer manufacturers (IBM, HP, DEC) had no interest in a product their customers weren’t asking for. Nobody “needed” a computer, and so PCs weren’t bought—they were sold. Flashy startups like Apple and Sinclair used hype to get noticed, while companies with footholds in consumer electronics like Atari, Commodore, and Tandy/RadioShack used strong retail connections to put their PCs in front of potential customers. The market grew slowly at first, accelerating only as experiments led to practical applications like the spreadsheet, introduced in 1979. As use grew, observation of use caused a reduction in uncertainty, leading to more adoption in a self-reinforcing cycle. This kind of gathering momentum takes time in every technological wave: It took almost 30 years for electricity to reach half of American households, for example, and it took about the same amount of time for personal computers.[3] When a technological revolution changes everything, it takes a huge amount of innovation, investment, storytelling, time, and plain old work. It also sucks up all the money and talent available. Like Kuhn’s paradigms in science, any technology not part of the wave’s techno-economic paradigm will seem like a sideshow.[4] Source: [3] The nascent growth of PCs attracted investors—venture capitalists—who started making risky bets on new companies. This development incentivized more inventors, entrepreneurs, and researchers, which in turn drew in more speculative capital. Companies like IBM, the computing behemoth before the PC, saw poor relative performance. They didn’t believe the PC could survive long enough to become capable in their market and didn’t care about new, small markets that wanted a cheaper solution. Retroactively, we give the PC pioneers the powers of prophets rather than visionaries. But at the time, nobody outside of a small group of early adopters paid any attention. Establishment media like The New York Times didn’t take the PC seriously until after IBM’s was introduced in August 1981. In the entire year of 1976, when Apple Computer was founded, the NYT mentioned PCs only four times.[5] Apparently, only the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, and the troublemakers were paying attention. Source: [5] It’s the element of surprise that should strike us most forcefully when we compare the early days of the computer revolution to today. No one took note of personal computers in the 1970s. In 2025, AI is all we seem to talk about. Big companies hate surprises. That’s why uncertainty makes a perfect moat for startups. Apple would never have survived IBM entering the market in 1979, and only lived to compete another day after raising $100 million in its 1980 IPO. It was the only remaining competitor after the IBM-induced winnowing.[6] Source: [6] As the tech took hold and started to show promise, innovations in software, memory, and peripherals like floppy disk drives and modems joined it. They reinforced one another, with each advance putting pressure on the technologies adjacent to it. When any part of the system held back the other parts, investors rushed to fund that sector. As increases in PC memory allowed more complicated software, for example, there became a need for more external storage, which caused VC Dave Marquardt to invest in disk drive manufacturer Seagate in 1980. Seagate gave Marquardt a 40x return when it went public in 1981. Other investors noticed, and some $270 million was plowed into the industry in the following three years.[7] Money also poured into the underlying infrastructure—fiber optic networks, chip making, etc.—so that capacity was never a bottleneck. Companies which used the new technological system to outperform incumbents began to take market share, and even staid competitors realized they needed to adopt the new thing or die. The hype became a froth which became an investment bubble: the dot-com frenzy of the late 1990s. The ICT wave was therefore similar to previous ones—like the investment mania of the 1830s and the Roaring ‘20s, which followed the infrastructure buildout of canals and railways, respectively—in which the human response to each stage predictably generated the next. When the dot-com bubble popped, society found it disapproved of the excesses in the sector and governments found they had the popular support to reassert authority over the tech companies and their investors. This put a brake on the madness. Instead of the reckless innovation of the bubble, companies started to expand into proven markets, and financiers moved from speculating to investing. Entrepreneurs began to focus on finding applications rather than on innovating the underlying technologies. Technological improvements continued, but change became more evolutionary than revolutionary. As change slowed, companies gained the confidence to invest for the longer term. They began to combine various parts of the system in new ways to create value for a wider group of users. The massive overbuilding of fiber optic telecom networks and other infrastructure during the frenzy left plenty of cheap capacity, keeping the costs of expansion down. It was a great time to be a businessperson and investor. In contrast, society did not need a bubble to pop to start excoriating AI. Given that the backlash to tech has been going on for a decade, this seems normal to us. But the AI backlash differs from the general high regard, earlier in the cycle, enjoyed by the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and others who built big tech businesses. The world hates change, and only gave tech a pass in the ‘80s and ‘90s because it all still seemed reversible: it could be made to go away if it turned out badly. This gave the early computer innovators some leeway to experiment. Now that everyone knows computers are here to stay, AI is not allowed the same wait-and-see attitude. It is seen as part of the ICT revolution. Perez, the economist, breaks each technological wave into four predictable phases: irruption, frenzy, synergy, and maturity. Each has a characteristic investment profile. The middle two, frenzy and synergy, are the easy ones for investors. Frenzy is when everyone piles in and investors are rewarded for taking big risks on unproven ideas, culminating in the bubble, when paper profits disappear. When rationality returns, the synergy phase begins, as companies make their products usable and productive for a wide array of users. Synergy pays those who are patient, picky, and can bring more than just money to the table. Irruption and maturity are more difficult to invest in. Investing in the 1970s was harder than it might look in hindsight. To invest from 1971 through 1975, you had to be either a true believer or a conglomerator with a knuckle-headed diversification strategy. Intel was a great investment, though it looked at first like a previous-wave electronics company. MOS Technologies was founded in 1969 to compete with Texas Instruments but sold a majority of itself to Allen-Bradley to stay afloat. Zilog was funded in 1975 by Exxon (Exxon!). Apple was a great investment, but it had none of the hallmarks of what VCs look for, as the PC was still a solution in search of a problem. It was later irruption, in the early 1980s, when great opportunities proliferated: PC makers (Compaq, Dell), software and operating systems (Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Adobe), peripherals (Seagate), workstations (Sun), and computer stores (Businessland), among others. If you invested in the winners, you did well. But there was still more money than ideas, which meant that it was no golden age for investing. By 1983, there were more than 70 companies competing in the disk drive sector alone, and valuations collapsed. There were plenty of people whose fortunes were established in the 1970s and 1980s, and many VCs made their names in that era. But the biggest advantage to being an irruption-stage investor was building institutional knowledge to invest early and well in the frenzy and synergy phases. Investing in the maturity phase is even more difficult. In irruption, it’s hard to see what will happen; in maturity, nothing much happens at all. The uncertainty about what will work and how customers and society will react is almost gone. Things are predictable, and everyone acts predictably. The lack of dynamism allows the successful synergy companies to remain entrenched (see: the Nifty 50 and FAANG), but growth becomes harder. They start to enter each other’s markets, conglomerate, raise prices, and cut costs. The era of products priced to entice new customers ends, and quality suffers. The big companies continue to embrace the idea of revolutionary innovation, but feel the need to control how their advances are used. R&D spending is redirected from product and process innovation toward increasingly fruitless attempts to find ways to extend the current paradigm. Companies frame this as a drive to win, but it’s really a fear of losing. Innovation can happen during maturity, sometimes spectacularly. But because these innovations only find support if they fit into the current wave’s paradigm, they are easily captured in the dominant companies’ gravity wells. This means making money as an entrepreneur or investor in them is almost impossible. Generative AI is clearly being captured by the dominant ICT companies, which raises the question of whether this time will be different for inventors and investors—a different question from whether AI itself is a revolutionary technology. Shipping containerization was a late-wave innovation that changed the world, kicked off our modern era of globalization, resulted in profound changes to society and the economy, and contributed to rapid growth in well-being. But there were, perhaps, only one or two people who made real money investing in it. The year 1956 was late in the previous wave. But that year, the company soon to be known as SeaLand revolutionized freight shipping with the launch of the first containership, the Ideal-X. SeaLand’s founder, Malcom McLean, had an epiphany that the job to be done by truckers, railroads, and shipping lines was to move goods from shipper to destination, not to drive trucks, fill boxcars, or lade boats. SeaLand allowed freight to transfer seamlessly from one mode to another, saving time, making shipping more predictable, and cutting costs—both the costs of loading, unloading, and reloading, and the cost of a ship sitting idly in port as it was loaded and unloaded.[8] The benefits of containerization, if it could be made to happen, were obvious. Everybody could see the efficiencies, and customers don’t care how something gets to where they can buy it, as long as it does. But longshoremen would lose work, politicians would lose the votes of those who lost work, port authorities would lose the support of the politicians, federal regulators would be blamed for adverse consequences, railroads might lose freight to shipping lines, shipping lines might lose freight to new shipping lines, and it would all cost a mint. Most thought McLean would never be able to make it work. McLean squeezed through the cracks of the opposition he faced. He bought and retrofitted war surplus ships, lowering costs. He went after the coastal shipping trade, a dying business in the age of the new interstates, to avoid competition. He set up shop in Newark, NJ, rather than the shipping hub of Hell’s Kitchen, to get buy-in from the port authority and avoid Manhattan congestion. And he made a deal with the New York longshoremen’s union, which was only possible because he was a small player whom they figured was not a threat. Source: [10] But competitors and regulators moved too quickly for McLean to seize the few barriers to entry that might have been available to him: domination of the ports, exclusive agreements with shippers or other forms of transportation, standardization on proprietary technology, etc.[9] When it started to look like it might work, around 1965, the obvious advantages of containerization meant that every large shipping line entered the business, and competition took off. Even though containerized freight was less than 1% of total trade by 1968, the number of containerships was already ramping fast.[10] Capacity outstripped demand for years. The increase in competition led to a rate war, which led to squeezed profits, which in turn led to consolidation and cartels. Meanwhile, the cost of building ever-larger container ships and the port facilities to deal with them meant the business became hugely capital intensive. McLean saw the writing on the wall and sold SeaLand to R.J. Reynolds in January 1969. He was, perhaps, the only entrepreneur to get out unscathed. It took a long time for the end-to-end vision to be realized. But around 1980, a dramatic drop began in the cost of sea freight.[11] This contributed to a boom in international trade[12] and allowed manufacturers to move away from higher-wage to lower-wage countries, making containerization irreversible. Source: [11] Some people did make money, of course; someone always does. McLean did, as did shipping magnate Daniel Ludwig, who had invested $8.5 million in SeaLand’s predecessor, McLean Industries, at $8.50 per share in 1965 and sold in 1969 for $50 per share.[13] Shipbuilders made money, too: between 1967 and 1972, some $10 billion ($80 billion in 2025 dollars) was spent building containerships. The contractors that built the new container ports also made money. And, later, shipping lines that consolidated and dominated the business, like Maersk and Evergreen, became very large. But, “for R.J. Reynolds, and for other companies that had chased fast growth by buying into container shipping in the late 1960s, their investments brought little but disappointment.”[14] Aside from McLean and Ludwig, it is hard to find anyone who became rich from containerization itself, because competition and capex costs made it hard to grow fast or achieve high margins. Source: [12] The business ended up being dominated primarily by the previous incumbents, and the margins went to the companies shipping goods, not the ones they shipped through. Companies like IKEA benefited from cheap shipping, going from a provincial Scandinavian company in 1972 to the world’s largest furniture retailer by 2008; container shipping was a perfect fit for IKEA’s flat-pack furniture. Others, like Walmart, used the predictability enabled by containerization to lower inventory and its associated costs. With hindsight, it’s easy to see how you could have invested in containerization: not in the container shipping industry itself, but in the industries that benefited from containerization. But even here, the success of companies like Walmart, Costco, and Target was coupled with the failure of others. The fallout from containerization set Sears and Woolworth on downward spirals, put the final nail in the coffin of Montgomery Ward and A&P, and drove Macy’s into bankruptcy before it was rescued and downsized by Federated. Meanwhile, in North Carolina, “the furniture capital of the world,” furniture makers tried to compete with IKEA by importing cheap pieces from China. They ended up being replaced by their suppliers.[15] If there had been more time to build moats, there might have been a few dominant containerization companies, and the people behind them would be at the top of the Forbes 400, while their investors would be legendary. But moats take time to build and, unlike the personal computer, the adoption of containerization wasn’t a surprise—every business with interests at stake had a strategic plan immediately. The economist Joseph Schumpeter said “perfect competition is and always has been temporarily suspended whenever anything new is being introduced.”[16] But containerization shows this isn’t true at the end of tech waves. And because there is no economic profit during perfect competition, there is no money to be made by innovators during maturity. Like containerization, the introduction of AI did not lead to a period of protected profits for its innovators. It led to an immediate competitive free-for-all. Let’s grant that generative AI is revolutionary (but also that, as is becoming increasingly clear, this particular tech is now already in an evolutionary stage). It will create a lot of value for the economy, and investors hope to capture some of it. When, who, and how depends on whether AI is the end of the ICT wave, or the beginning of a new one. If AI had started a new wave, there would have been an extended period of uncertainty and experimentation. There would have been a population of early adopters experimenting with their own models. When thousands or millions of tinkerers use the tech to solve problems in entirely new ways, its uses proliferate. But because they are using models owned by the big AI companies, their ability to fully experiment is limited to what’s allowed by the incumbents, who have no desire to permit an extended challenge to the status quo. This doesn’t mean AI can’t start the next technological revolution. It might, if experimentation becomes cheap, distributed and permissionless—like Wozniak cobbling together computers in his garage, Ford building his first internal combustion engine in his kitchen, or Trevithick building his high-pressure steam engine as soon as James Watt’s patents expired. When any would-be innovator can build and train an LLM on their laptop and put it to use in any way their imagination dictates, it might be the seed of the next big set of changes—something revolutionary rather than evolutionary. But until and unless that happens, there can be no irruption. AI is instead the epitome of the ICT wave. The computing visionaries of the 1960s set out to build a machine that could think, which their successors eventually did, by extending gains in algorithms, chips, data, and data center infrastructure. Like containerization, AI is an extension of something that came before, and therefore no one is surprised by what it can and will do. In the 1970s, it took time for people to wrap their heads around the desirability of powerful and ubiquitous computing. But in 2025, machines that think better than previous machines are easy for people to understand. Consider the extent to which the progress of AI rhymes with the business evolution of containerization: In the “AI rhymes” column, the first four items are already underway. How you should invest depends on whether you believe Nos. 5–7 are next. Economists are predicting that AI will increase global GDP somewhere between 1%[17] to more than 7%[18] over the next decade, which is $1–7 trillion of new value created. The big question is where that money will stick as it flows through the value chain. Most AI market overviews have a score or more categories, breaking each of them into customer and industry served. But these will change dramatically over the next few years. You could, instead, just follow the money to simplify the taxonomy of companies: What the history of containerization suggests is that, if you aren’t already an investor in a model company, you shouldn’t bother. Sam Altman and a few other early movers may make a fortune, as McLean and Ludwig did. But the huge costs of building and running a model, coupled with intense competition, means there will, in the end, be only a few companies, each funded and owned by the largest tech companies. If you’re already an investor, congratulations: There will be consolidation, so you might get an exit. Domain-specific models—like Cursor or Harvey—will be part of the consolidation. These are probably the most valuable models. But fine-tuning is relatively cheap, and there are big economies of scope. On the other hand, just as Google had to buy Invite Media in 2010 to figure out how to sell to ad agencies, domain-specific model companies that have earned the trust of their customers will be prime acquisition targets. And although it seems possible that models which generate things other than language—like Midjourney or Runway—might use their somewhat different architecture to carve out a separate technological path, the LLM companies have easily entered this space as well. Whether this applies to companies like Osmo remains to be seen. While it’s too late to invest in the model companies, the profusion of those using the models to solve specific problems is ongoing: Perplexity, InflectionAI, Writer, Abridge, and a hundred others. But if any of these become very valuable, the model companies will take their earnings, either through discriminatory pricing or vertical integration. Success, in other words, will mean defeat—always a bad thesis. At some point, model companies and app companies will converge: There will simply be AI companies, and only a few of them. There will be some winners, as always, but investments in the app layer as a whole will lose money. The same caveat applies, however: If an app company can build a customer base or an amazing team, it might be acquired. But these companies aren’t really technology companies at all; they are building a market on spec and have to be priced as such. A further caveat is that there will be investors who make a killing arbitraging FOMO-panicked acquirors willing to massively overpay. But this is not really “investing.” There might be an investment opportunity in companies that manage the interface between the AI giants and their customers, or protect company data from the model companies—like Hugging Face or Glean—because these businesses are by nature independent of the models. But no analogue in the post-containerization shipping market became very large. Even the successful intermediation companies in the AI space will likely end up mid-sized because the model companies will not allow them to gain strategic leverage—another consequence of the absence of surprise. When an industry is going to be big but there is uncertainty about how it will play out, it often makes sense to swim upstream to the industry’s suppliers. In the case of AI, this means the chip providers, data companies, and cloud/data center companies: SambaNova, Scale AI, and Lambda, as well as those that have been around for a long time, like Nvidia and Bloomberg. The case for data is mixed. General data—i.e., things most people know, including everything anyone knew more than, say, 10 years ago, and most of what was learned after that—is a commodity. There may be room for a few companies to do the grunt work of collating and tagging it, but since the collating and tagging might best be done by AI itself, there will not be a lot of pricing leverage. Domain-specific models will need specialist data, and other models will try to answer questions about the current moment. Specific, timely, and hard to reproduce data will be valuable. This is not a new market, of course—Bloomberg and others have done well by it. A more concentrated customer base will lower prices for this data, while wider use will raise revenues. On balance, this will probably be a plus for the industry, though not a huge one. There will be new companies built, but only a couple worth investing in. The high capex of AI companies will primarily be spent with the infrastructure companies. These companies are already valued with this expectation, so there won’t be an upside surprise. But consider that shipbuilding benefited from containerization from 1965 until demand collapsed after about 1973.[19] If AI companies consolidate or otherwise act in concert, even a slight downturn that forces them to conserve cash could turn into a serious, sudden, and long-lasting decline in infrastructure spending. This would leave companies like Nvidia and its emerging competitors—who must all make long-term commitments to suppliers and for capacity expansion—unable to lower costs to match the new, smaller market size. Companies priced for an s-curve are overpriced if there’s a peak and decline. Source: [19] All of which means that investors shouldn’t swim upstream, but fish downstream: companies whose products rely on achieving high-quality results from somewhat ambiguous information will see increased productivity and higher profits. These sectors include professional services, healthcare, education, financial services, and creative services, which together account for between a third and a half of global GDP and have not seen much increased productivity from automation. AI can help lower costs, but as with containerization, how individual businesses incorporate lower costs into their strategies—and what they decide to do with the savings—will determine success. To put it bluntly, using cost savings to increase profits rather than grow revenue is a loser’s game. The companies that will benefit most rapidly are those whose strategies are already conditional on lowering costs. IKEA’s longtime strategy was to sell quality furniture for low prices and make it up on volume. After containerization made it possible for them to go worldwide, IKEA became the world’s largest retailer and Ingvar Kamprad (the IK of IKEA) became a billionaire. Similarly, Walmart, whose strategy was high volume and low prices in underserved markets, benefited from both cost savings and just-in-time supply chains, allowing increased product variety and lower inventory costs. Today’s knowledge-work companies that already prioritize the same values are the least risky way to bet on AI, but new companies will form or re-form with a high-volume, low-cost strategy, just as Costco did in the early 1980s. New companies will compete with the incumbents, but with a clean slate and hindsight. Regardless, there are few barriers to entry, so each of these firms will face stiff competition and operate in fragmented markets. Experienced management and flawless execution will be key. Being an entrepreneur will be a fabulous proposition in these sectors. Being an investor will be harder. Companies will not need much private capital—IKEA never needed to raise risk capital, and Costco raised only one round in 1983 before going public in 1985—because implementing cost-savings technology is not capital intensive. As with containerization, there will be a long lag between technology trigger and the best investments. The opportunities will be later. Stock pickers will also make money, but they need to be choosy. At the high end of projections, an additional 7% in GDP growth over ten years within one third of the economy gives a tailwind of only about 2% per year to these companies—even less if productivity growth from older ICT products abates. The primary value shift will be to companies that are embracing the strategic implications of AI from companies that are not, the way Walmart benefited from Sears, which took advantage of cheaper goods prices but did not reinvent itself. Consumers, however, will be the biggest beneficiaries. Previous waves of mechanization benefited labor productivity in manufacturing, driving prices down and saving consumers money. But increased labor productivity in manufacturing also led to higher manufacturing wages. Wages in services businesses had to rise to compete, even though these businesses did not benefit from productivity gains. This caused the price of services to rise.[20] The share of household spending on food and clothing went from 55% in 1918 to 16% in 2023,[21] but the cost of knowledge-intensive services like healthcare and education have grown well above inflation. Something similar will happen with AI: Knowledge-intensive services will get cheaper, allowing consumers to buy more of them, while services that require person-to-person interaction will get more expensive, taking up a greater percentage of household spending. This points to obvious opportunities in both. But the big news is that most of the new value created by AI will be captured by consumers, who should see a wider variety of knowledge-intensive goods at reasonable prices, and wider and more affordable access to services like medical care, education, and advice. There is nothing better than the beginning of a new wave, when the opportunities to envision, invent, and build world-changing companies leads to money, fame, and glory. But there is nothing more dangerous for investors and entrepreneurs than wishful thinking. The lessons learned from investing in tech over the last 50 years are not the right ones to apply now. The way to invest in AI is to think through the implications of knowledge workers becoming more efficient, to imagine what markets this efficiency unlocks, and to invest in those. For decades, the way to make money was to bet on what the new thing was. Now, you have to bet on the opportunities it opens up.

London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester are set to benefit from a wave of new US investment into the financial services sector, reinforcing the strength of the UK-US economic partnership ahead of next week’s Presidential State Visit. Working with America is best for Britain — and today’s announcement proves it. A total of over £1.25 billion in private sector commitments from leading US firms — including PayPal, Bank of America, Citi Bank, and S&P Global — will support job creation, drive innovation, and deliver improved services for consumers in the UK. US giants are capitalising on Britain’s leadership in financial services – expanding operations and opening new offices across the nation, with London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester set to gain from a wave of skilled job creation. Bank of America is set to create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast, marking its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland — a major milestone that underscores the region’s growing role in global financial services. Citi Group today confirms it is investing £1.1 billion across its UK operations, including a further commitment to growing its presence in Northern Ireland where the bank is already one of the top employers in Belfast now employing over 4,000 people — firmly establishing Belfast as a major technology powerhouse. BlackRock are celebrating the opening of their new Edinburgh office this week, which will see their 800-strong footprint nearly double, as part of their multi-billion dollar investment into the UK. In Manchester, S&P Global are investing over £4 million into their Manchester offices which will support 200 permanent jobs to boost their nearly 3,000-strong UK workforce. Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said: Today’s announcements reinforce the UK’s position as the world’s leading investment destination. Our financial services sector is at the heart of a modern, dynamic Industrial Strategy. Strengthening ties with the US boosts our economy, creates jobs, and secures our role in global finance, delivering on our Plan for Change. These investments reflect the strength of our enduring ‘golden corridor’ with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the US Presidential State Visit. This marks a significant vote of confidence in the UK’s position as a global financial hub and in the government’s plan to make Britain the best place in the world to invest — a vision underpinned by the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy, which is driving investment into priority sectors like financial services. These investments highlight the enduring value of the transatlantic relationship — a cornerstone of shared prosperity that supports millions of jobs and drives growth in every region. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said: This commitment from America’s leading financial institutions demonstrates the immense potential of the UK economy, our strong relationship with the US and the confidence global investors have in our Plan for Change, which is making the UK the best place in the world to invest and do business. These investments will create thousands of high-skilled jobs from Belfast to Edinburgh, kickstarting the growth that is essential to putting money in working people’s pockets across every part of the United Kingdom. Broadridge is making major investments into their new London office, further strengthening its UK presence and deepening transatlantic ties in financial services. As part of the UK’s expanding fintech and digital innovation sector, PayPal is announcing a £150m investment in product innovations and growth that will benefit customers throughout the UK, reinforcing Britain’s position as a key market for the brand globally. Jane Fraser, Citi Group CEO said: Citi’s commitment to the UK runs deep. This is home to many of our most senior leaders and nearly 14,000 colleagues across London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. We’re proud to be serving 85% of the FTSE 100 and to have stood beside UK companies through every market cycle, raising capital, financing growth and helping them compete on the world stage. The UK isn’t simply one of our largest markets; it is core to Citi’s foundation as a truly global bank. The UK-US investment relationship has never been stronger, with over £1.2 trillion invested in each other’s countries at the end of 2023. These new investment announcements are accompanied by new significant commitments by financial companies to ramp up their commercial activity and capital flows between our two economies in the coming years. Blackrock is expecting to allocate over £7 billion to the UK market next year on behalf of clients, and is investing £500 million into enterprise data centres across the country. Rothesay is planning to double its investment in the US (by £7 billion) over the next few years, and OakNorth is committing to increased capital and lending of over £3.5 billion to support its US operations. British banks are expanding their US footprint; Barclays alone has deployed over $2 trillion in capital across the US in 2024 and continues to play a pivotal role in strengthening UK-US investment ties. The bank has an ambition to double this amount over the next decade, expanding its footprint and supporting growth across sectors. All in all, that will see investment and capital commitments of over £8 billion coming to the UK, and over £12 billion going the other way, creating jobs and opportunity in both countries. Earlier this year, the Chancellor launched the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, which included financial services as a high growth sector, signifying the UK’s commitment improving financial regulations and driving investment and skilled jobs into the UK. The UK and US agreed an Economic Prosperity Deal which secured major tariff reductions for key sectors and protected jobs in the automotive and aerospace sector. Discussions continue with the US on a wider UK-US Economic Deal which will look at increasing digital trade, strengthen supply chains and boost access for our world-leading services companies. Today’s announcements mark the start of a week of activity to strengthen economic ties between the US and UK. Further announcements reflected in the totals above are expected this week: Please see below for a list of all the investments announced today. Bank of America is set to create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast, marking its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland — a major milestone that underscores the region’s growing role in global financial services. Brian Moynihan, Chair and CEO of Bank of America, said: At Bank of America we are focused on helping our clients advance economic opportunity and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. The early US-UK trade agreement that the President and the Prime Minister began discussing in February has provided the business community with the certainty and framework it needs to strengthen transatlantic commerce. We are pleased to be able to extend Bank of America’s investment in the UK with the creation of a new Belfast operations facility to support our global business, bringing up to 1,000 new opportunities to Northern Ireland. Citi Group are investing £1.1 billion into the UK. The UK is Citi’s second largest market globally, employing 14,000 people across the UK, working across four main sites – London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. Citi Bank have undertaken a major investment into the refurbishment of our Canary Wharf headquarters and continued investment into their Northern Ireland operations. BlackRock will open their new Edinburgh offices on 18 September, which shows their ongoing commitment to the area - this new home will allow Blackrock to grow from 800 to 1,400. Once complete, two of the top five largest BlackRock offices will be in the UK. Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, said: As the largest asset manager in the UK, BlackRock is proud to serve over 13 million British people who are saving for retirement. Today we are announcing an investment of half a billion pounds into enterprise data centres across the country, advancing digital infrastructure for British-based businesses. In addition, over the last year our clients around the world invested over £7bn into UK public equity and fixed income securities. We expect this trend to continue, supporting jobs, growth and innovation across a wide range of British industries. PayPal is announcing a £150m investment in product innovations and growth that will benefit customers throughout the United Kingdom. This incorporates financing for new product initiatives that have been created for British consumers, which are due to launch in the coming months. It reinforces Britain’s position as a key market for the brand globally. PayPal CEO, Alex Chriss said: The UK has always been an important region for PayPal, serving millions of customers and businesses for the last two decades,” said PayPal President & CEO Alex Chriss. As the pioneer of e-commerce, PayPal is making a £150mm investment in UK to enable British consumers and businesses to be among the first in the world to experience our latest innovations, including AI-enabled shopping experiences. Barclays is building out its Americas headquarters in Times Square, New York. With state-of-the-art facilities and technology, this flagship office will connect the US and UK and serve as a global hub that drives innovation for clients and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2024, Barclays helped raise and lend a total of $2 trillion in financing and capital for US clients. Our ambition is to double this amount over the next decade. C.S. Venkatakrishnan, Group Chief Executive at Barclays said: As the leading British bank, with deep roots in the United States, Barclays is uniquely positioned to unlock opportunities that deepen commerce, drive innovation, and fuel sustainable growth. Our transatlantic presence enables us to connect clients to capital, ideas, and partnerships that power progress across both markets. OakNorth are investing over $5 billion into the US market over the next three years, helping create thousands of new jobs across the country. As a digital bank focused on the lower middle market, OakNorth supports a wide range of businesses that drive productivity throughout the economy. OakNorth was one of the first foreign digital banks to get approval to set up a US Representative Office in 2024 under the oversight of the FED and NYDFS. Rishi Khosla, co-founder and CEO of OakNorth said: The US State Visit marks a pivotal moment in UK-US relations, with both governments reaffirming their shared commitment to free enterprise, strategic cooperation, and sustainable growth. The scale and ambition of the investments being made reflect the unique strength of the economic partnership between our two nations. At OakNorth, we see this relationship in action every day - since July 2023, we have lent nearly $2bn to lower mid-market businesses in the US, and we are committed to investing billions more in the coming years. By supporting these vital businesses, we aim to help drive innovation, create jobs, and fuel sustainable growth across both economies. Starling Group is investing over $100 million over the coming years to unlock growth in their US operations. Raman Bhatia, Starling Group CEO said: The US State Visit highlights the importance of a strong UK-US economic relationship that helps create jobs, sustainable growth and pushes the bounds of innovation. At Starling Group we are driving forward activity to bring our model of responsible digital banking to US consumers, and we welcome both governments reaffirming their shared commitment to free enterprise and strategic cooperation. As part of our ambition to unlock growth, Starling Group is planning to invest well over $100m in the US over the next few years. Revolut is set to invest over $500 million in the United States over the next 3-5 years to accelerate its expansion and support its ambition to scale as a bank for American consumers. This investment is expected to create hundreds of high-quality U.S. jobs and underscores the strength of the UK-US economic partnership. Nik Storonsky, Co-Founder and CEO of Revolut said: The United States represents a key pillar of our global growth strategy. That’s why we are committing over $500 million to significantly accelerate our expansion in the U.S. This strategic long-term investment will create hundreds of high-skilled, well-paying American jobs, while also enhancing competition and delivering greater value and choice for consumers. It also underscores the strength and depth of the transatlantic economic partnership, built on the UK and U.S. shared leadership in financial innovation.

Austin’s dynamic and developing technology landscape serves as an exciting backdrop that will support the Wise team as we continue to build offerings that meet the international money needs of our growing customer base both locally and globally. We look forward to continuing our growth alongside this city’s success. Broadridge Financial Solutions, a global Fintech leader, is strengthening its commitment to the United Kingdom with continued investment in London. The company is opening a new flagship office in the city, which will serve as its international headquarters. This expanded presence underscores Broadridge’s long term commitment to its UK workforce and clients, with capacity to grow beyond its current 750 employees in the UK as the company continues to expand internationally. Broadridge recently acquired UK communications company, Signal, bringing nearly 100 skilled team members into Broadridge’s UK workforce. Together, these investments mark Broadridge’s confidence in the UK as a hub for financial services and fintech innovation, and its intent to play a growing role in supporting the strength and competitiveness of the UK’s capital markets.

The UK is home to many of S&P Global’s most important business units and operations; the UK is a crucial strategic hub for it to service its key markets worldwide. Lloyds of London provided $20.8 billion in US surplus lines insurance capacity in 2024 – nearly 16 percent of the entire US surplus lines market – offering complex, specialist coverage where standard insurers are unwilling or unable to do so, including for newer and emerging risks that mainstream insurers may be less familiar with. Lloyd’s holds over $14 billion in US trust funds, primarily invested in US Treasuries, supporting infrastructure and economic growth. Chair of Lloyd’s Sir Charles Roxburgh said: The United States has an extraordinary economy, powered by world-class talent, vast resources and exceptional capacity for innovation. I remain deeply confident in its long-term growth potential. At Lloyd’s, we stand shoulder to shoulder with American businesses and communities – supporting growth and recovery by paying billions in claims when they’re needed most.

Title: Markets have been acting ‘super weird’ lately. Just look at gold prices vs. the dollar and bonds

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Financial markets have already had an unusual year, but recent price action lately has been especially bizarre, according to Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. In a Substack post on Tuesday titled “Super weird markets since Jackson Hole,” he traced the path of key assets since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to rate cuts in a speech at the annual central bank symposium last month. “You’d have thought that would weigh on the Dollar, lift the S&P 500 and boost commodity prices across the board. But that hasn’t happened,” Brooks wrote. “The only thing that’s moved is gold, with a massive price rise of almost 10 percent.” To be sure, stocks have rallied since his post as benign inflation data cleared the way for Fed rate cuts when policymakers meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gold prices have also marched higher, setting fresh highs along the way and closing Friday at $3,680.70 per ounce. But the bond market has behaved more unexpectedly. Brooks noted the 30-year Treasury yield didn’t fall right after Powell’s speech but only turned lower after another bad jobs report was released two weeks later. “The fact that the 30-year Treasury yield didn’t fall immediately is weird and worrying,” he added. “It took very weak payrolls to finally do that.” In addition, while the dollar index has had some ups and downs, it has returned to about where it was before Powell’s speech, with Brooks calling that “counterintuitive” as expectations for Fed easing would typically bring it lower. Meanwhile, bitcoin sold off after Jackson Hole but is also back where it started, even though cryptocurrencies have generally acted like risk assets in the past and previously rallied on rate-cut hopes. “What does all this mean? Recent market moves suggest gold is the ultimate safe haven,” Brooks said. “Bitcoin is proving too volatile and speculative, so — as political pressure on the Fed mounts — markets gravitate to gold.” Fears of a debt crisis in France and the U.K. have jolted global bond yields higher in recent weeks. Political gridlock in France in particular has dimmed hopes that Paris will rein in deficits anytime soon. On Friday evening, Fitch downgraded France’s credit rating from AA- to A+, the lowest level ever for the eurozone’s second-largest economy, saying a major shift to fiscal discipline is unlikely. It’s possible the crisis in France sent more investors looking for a safe haven toward the dollar, potentially explaining why the greenback has been stable, Brooks said. After his post, other global events have stirred more geopolitical concerns that may also favor the dollar. Israel attacked Hamas leaders in Qatar, a close U.S. Mideast ally, sparking sharp backlash in the region and sending oil prices higher. And Russian drones entered Polish airspace, forcing NATO allies to activate air-defense systems and deploy fighters jets that shot down the aircraft. “The bottom line is that there’s a lot of things in markets that don’t currently hang together well at all,” Brooks said. The key question is whether the rise in gold prices is sign that the dollar is losing its reserve currency status, though he thinks it’s just temporary noise and sees a reversion to the mean eventually. In a note on Tuesday, Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, also noticed the odd market moves that have been going on. But he said “the tell” is the dollar’s 10% decline year to date against other global currencies, which stems from President Donald Trump’s efforts to weaken Fed independence, worsen deficits, and reorder the global trading system. “When you take all that into account, those market moves suddenly start to make a lot more sense,” Brown added. “Yes, the correlations are unusual. But, so is the macroeconomic environment, and so are the policy choices that continue to be made, as government spending runs away with itself across DM, rate cuts resume stateside, inflation risks remain tilted to the upside, and a potential economic re-acceleration looms now the initial trade/tariff uncertainty has (largely) been navigated.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Is the Fed’s upcoming rate cut a ‘huge mistake’?

Traders place the odds of a rate cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting at over 90%, but not everyone is happy about the prospect of easy money. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. If you’re following the markets, you’ll know the Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates next week to stimulate a lagging economy. While most crypto traders are jumping for joy at the thought of fresh liquidity entering the system, not everybody’s happy. The upcoming rate cut, according to some, could have a catastrophic effect on the global economy. Economist, investor, and everybody’s favorite goldbug Peter Schiff did not mince his words, calling a rate cut a “huge mistake” in a post shared on X. As crypto traders gear up for a potentially bullish period, Schiff warns of serious consequences that will gravely impact the economy. His commentary is blunt. He points to recent price moves in gold and silver as clear evidence that the rate cut is being telegraphed by the markets. Schiff wrote: “Silver just traded above $42. Gold is poised to break to a new record high. I think the precious metals are getting ready to melt up. This is an unmistakable market signal that the Fed’s upcoming rate cut is a huge mistake.” He argues that the decision will set off a string of cuts and a return to aggressive quantitative easing, potentially with “definitive yield curve control.” Schiff claims the U.S. dollar could lose its reserve currency status as confidence in the Fed’s judgment wavers. Peter Schiff has long pushed the view that overly easy policy will stoke inflation and put the dollar at risk. He believes that today’s environment represents the Fed’s most damaging error yet. “Ever since Alan Greenspan rescued the stock market after the 1987 crash, the Fed has made a series of increasingly bad monetary policy mistakes.” Risk-on asset traders welcome rate cuts with open arms. Lower interest rates flood markets with cheap capital and loosen financial conditions, which typically results in higher prices for volatile assets like crypto. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins tend to rally as liquidity improves, triggering a wave of buying and bullish sentiment. The CME’s FedWatch tool shows market participants almost unanimously expect a cut (93.4%), with bets on both Bitcoin and altcoins accelerating into the meeting. Lower rates mean money can move out of safe havens and into riskier bets, which is another reason Schiff is opposed to the cut. In plain language: Traders want easy money. Recent cycles show crypto runs higher whenever the Fed loosens policy, and traders are already calling for a new bull market as expectations for rate cuts hit fever pitch. While Schiff sounds the alarm, many respected analysts, including teams at Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and a 107-economist Reuters survey, see the rate cut as a necessary step to support the weakening labor market and prevent recession. Goldman’s chief economist expects a series of small cuts, noting softer employment data and muted inflation as justification for easing. Others warn that cutting rates too fast could actually push inflation higher or weaken the dollar, backing some of Schiff’s concerns. Jefferies strategist David Zervos suggested the Fed might need a deep 75 basis point cut, though he also cautioned that easy money could ultimately hurt by driving up prices and weakening currency fundamentals. The upcoming Fed rate cut is a flashpoint. Schiff says it risks disaster, spiraling cuts, runaway inflation, and a weaker dollar. Crypto traders, though, are celebrating the prospect of more easy money and the next phase in the bull run. The broader economist community remains split, weighing soft employment against inflation risk.

Title: 3 Reasons The Growth Of DeFi Is Lagging Among Institutions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/09/13/3-reasons-the-growth-of-defi-is-lagging-among-institutions/
Time Published: 2025-09-13T16:47:17Z

BySean Stein Smith, Contributor. Even as the cryptoasset ecosystem grows, market capitalizations remain near all-time-highs, and TradFi institutions continue to deploy an array of products and services one subset of the crypto ecosystem is still looking to recover 2021 and 2022 excitement: decentralized finance. This may come as a surprise to some crypto-native investors, as the total value locked has risen to a new record of $130 billion according to research by DeFiLlama. These deposits, placed and managed in a blockchain or DeFi protocol have more than doubled since April, and reflect the overall shift in both policy directives and investor sentiment. Ironically enough the growth and deposits in the DeFi sector continue to trend toward centralization, with three (3) players dominating the space. Aave possess a TVL of more than $68 billion, which is the largest of any DeFi lending protocol, leverages a pool-based lending protocol, and in August launched an institutional platform allowing larger investors to participate. Morpho and JustLend round out the top players in the DeFi landscape, but both have substantially lower TVL’s and – in some cases – more limited offerings. In spite of these record levels of deposits, and positive tailwinds, institutional adoption and utilization of DeFi continues to lag. JPMorgan, itself one of the most innovative TradFi banks via its Kinexys (formerly Onyx) suite of on-chain products and services, has recently noted the disappointing progress for both DeFi and tokenized assets by institutions in the TradFi space. Notably, the bulk of the activity and growth in DeFi has come from retail and/or crypto-native institutions. Let’s take a look at a few reasons why DeFi, despite its growth and record deposits, still needs better regulation. A common issue that continues to stall wider utilization of DeFi across broader areas of the economy – both crypto-native and TradFi – are issues related to interoperability and liquidity across multiple chains. While the most common manifestation of this takes the form of differing valuations for some tokens when analyzed across chains, and this includes valuations for stablecoins, there are other issues that DeFi needs to address. Firstly, the traceability and transparency of transactions, tokens, and tokenized assets as they move across chains is something that will need to be standardized and improved upon to obtain more institutional adoption. Additionally, although consumers have been the primary drivers of this recent uptick in DeFi TVL, institutions of all kinds need to have absolute confidence that transactions, payments, and confirmations can occur as seamlessly as occur using current payment rails and options. Much like how bitcoin has achieved and maintained higher price levels, obtained policy victories, and generated increased interest once firms like Blackrock entered the space via spot ETF products, DeFi will need TradFi firms to embrace DeFi-first options to generate similar growth. An ongoing issue in the wider cryptoasset ecosystem, not limited to the DeFi space, is the still-evolving standards and best practices related to auditing and assurance connected to blockchain, cryptoassets, and the smart contracts that power many of the Layer 2, Web 3, and more innovative use cases that have deployed in the 2024-2025 timespan. With cybercriminals already having stolen over $2 billion in 2025, according to DeFiLlama, a 77% increase from 2024, the weaknesses of the DeFi ecosystem continue to prove lucrative for hackers and other criminal elements. While the smart contract space has certainly evolved substantially since initially introduced, with many organizations leveraging these applications, the fact remains that the standards, transparency, and auditability of smart contracts is a work in progress. This status provides several obstacles to institutional adoption of DeFi. First, if organizations cannot trust smart contracts – or at least trust that issues can be remediated in a timely manner – customers and regulators will not be on board either. Secondly, especially for publicly traded organizations, if auditability, record-keeping, and traceability remain questions, bodies such as the SEC (even under the new pro-crypto regime) will be hesitant to approve related projects. In short, the very smart contracts that power DeFi at the most important level continue to prove a point of weakness. Last but not least the DeFi sector – even with nearly $200 billion in total value locked – remains a miniscule fraction of the overall lending market and financial ecosystem. For contextual purposes, JP Morgan Chase reported daily payment processing volume of $10 trillion in a recent earnings release. Crypto and crypto-adjacent products and services have experienced significant growth, adoption, and acceptance since the last bear market kicked off by the collapse of FTX, but still are – for all intents and purposes – a fringe component of the financial world. To address this, in addition to the points raised above, are directly related to the ability of DeFi protocols to scale to meet customer demand as well as addressing the reliability, reversibility, and potential hackability of smart contracts underpinning the protocols. A critical component of this process will entail both working the TradFi financial sector as well as improving regulatory-mandated mechanisms such as KYC and AML safeguards. As policy continues to pivot and produce tailwinds versus headwinds it is reasonable to assume this will occur, but investors and policymakers should remain cautious before pushing for widespread utilization is the DeFi infrastructure is not yet prepared. DeFi continues to grow, but work remains to attract institutional buy-in.

Title: Stocks Reach Highs On Oracle And Fed Expectations
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/09/13/stocks-reach-highs-on-oracle-and-fed-expectations/
Time Published: 2025-09-13T15:38:14Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high last Thursday but declined fractionally on Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed with Oracle’s (ORCL) earnings further reinforcing the artificial intelligence (AI) growth narrative. Notably, banks performed well, which hints that the market is expecting a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut next week and a resilient economy. All signs point to artificial intelligence as being a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Indications suggest that the adoption of artificial intelligence is continuing at a rapid pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. This spending has created a virtuous cycle of spending and earnings for several mega-cap technology companies, including many of the Magnificent 7, which have seen their earnings and valuations flourish. While not included in the Magnificent 7, Oracle (ORCL) has quietly become a beneficiary of the seemingly insatiable current demand for AI training and the emerging demand for AI inferencing. Oracle’s management believes that its architecture enables better AI training at a lower cost for clients, providing a competitive edge. Additionally, their legacy database business enables Oracle’s clients to utilize their own data to offer AI inferencing, producing actionable insights, decisions, and predictions. AI inferencing is the crucial next step to AI demand and growth, since it is the use case for AI and expands the potential demand base to all corporations. Last week, Oracle announced a remaining performance obligation (RPO) of $455.3 billion, which can be thought of as an order backlog or contracted revenue that hasn’t yet been fulfilled. Oracle’s RPO grew by $317.5 billion quarter-over-quarter from AI-related contracts. This growth in RPO stems from multi-year contracts, so this revenue will likely be realized over a roughly seven-year period. In any case, analysts’ estimates now expect Oracle’s revenue growth to accelerate from 8.4% year-over-year for fiscal 2025 to 21.9% in 2027. While the exact margins and thus profits on this new business remain unknown, the apparent demand for their services sent the stock soaring by 25.5% last week. The supportive news from Oracle fueled the continued rally in many AI-related technology companies, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA) outperforming the S&P 500 handily last week. The August employment report saw payrolls grow by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Additionally, Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. Since then, on September 9, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released preliminary revisions to payroll data, showing that 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the twelve months through March 2025 than were initially reported. This record-breaking downward revision roughly halved the job growth estimate from previous projections. According to recent data, the four-week average of initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to near a year-to-date high. While the absolute level of initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits looks benign, the trend is moving higher. Continuing claims for benefits are also above the lows, indicating a slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. While the four-week average of initial claims for benefits is typically used to remove the volatility, the weekly claims were the highest in over three years. Consensus estimates suggest that the weekly claims will revert to roughly the four-week average level this week, as the spike last week was primarily due to filings in Texas. Following the weaker jobs data, a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting is a virtual certainty. Fed fund futures are pricing in a 100% chance of a rate cut this week. Beyond the cut this week, markets expect an additional two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts for the remainder of 2025. Bottom line: The September rate cut is widely expected, so that the focus will shift to expectations for future cuts. The Fed’s release of its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), along with Chair Powell’s comments, will be closely scrutinized for clues as to the expected pace of lower short-term rates. There are only five companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with FedEx (FDX) as the most notable for economic insights. August retail sales are scheduled for Wednesday. The US consumer has remained resilient, which is crucial for economic growth expectations, as consumer spending is the primary driver. Expectations are for some moderation from last month’s pace, but the data will be watched for signs that tariffs or the softening job market might be weighing on spending. Stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of banks and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. Further, the implied expectation is that the Fed will cut interest rates aggressively enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. While there are signs of deterioration in the labor market, there remains little evidence of an impending recession, and tech spending around AI is supporting rapid earnings growth in that sector. While the Fed will almost certainly cut rates this week, the implied future pace of easing might be slower than markets would like, which could result in increased stock volatility.

When business is surging, companies often expand their workforces to handle demand. That's not what's happening lately at some of America's biggest tech companies. Oracle's (ORCL) booming AI-driven backlog sent its stock to a record high this week—just weeks after reports the computing giant laid off hundreds of workers as part of an effort curb costs. Several other tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have shed jobs recently even as their revenues rose. (Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on the layoffs in time for publication.) The tech sector has been one of the heaviest hit by layoffs so far this year, second only to government jobs, according to a report from Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. And many of the industry's biggest companies are cutting from a large base: Data from online job board Indeed shows that listings for tech jobs peaked in 2022, outpacing the growth of available jobs in the economy at large, but that trend has reversed. Leading tech firms are trimming their ranks as demand for their services grows. Their swelling spending on AI data centers and hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) is one contributing factor, according to Wall Street analysts. AI expenditures are pushing tech leaders to cut costs elsewhere, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria has previously told Investopedia, driving many to cut staff or slow hiring to relieve pressure on profit margins. Some, he said, also expect to need fewer workers because of the technology. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June that he expects AI will likely lead Amazon to eventually operate with a smaller total headcount. He encouraged them to become more familiar with AI tools, suggesting that those who do could be better-positioned "to have high impact and help us reinvent the company." Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated that about 6% to 7% of U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI. However, they're still optimistic about its effects on the job market, suggesting that losses could be "fleeting" and observing that job displacement due to labor-saving technological advances in the past have tended to fade after about two years. "We remain skeptical that AI will lead to large employment reductions over the next decade," they wrote. "Predictions that technology will reduce the need for human labor have a long history but a poor track record."

WisdomTree has launched a new tokenized fund focusing on private credit. The new fund, called the WisdomTree Private Credit and Alternative Income Digital Fund (CRDT), tracks a basket of 35 publicly traded closed-end funds, business development companies, and real estate investment trusts, Bloomberg reports. It’s available with a minimum investment of just $25 and offers two-day redemption. WisdomTree, it’s worth adding, launched an ETF tracking the same benchmark in 2021, the WisdomTree Private Credit and Alternative Income Fund. Private credit, lending done outside traditional banks, has ballooned in recent years as investors chase yield-focused investment options. “It’s really just about bringing the asset class to a whole universe of different investors,” said Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree. The firm has launched a number of tokenized investment vehicles so far, including ones offering exposure to money market funds, fixed income securities, and equities. The new fund joins a growing trend among Wall Street’s largest asset managers. BlackRock, for example, manages a $2 billion money market fund, while Fidelity’s tokenized money market fund recently rolled out on Ethereum. WisdomTree joins a broader trend. BlackRock’s tokenized $2 billion money market fund and experiments from Fidelity and VanEck suggest traditional finance is taking real-world asset tokenization seriously, even if it’s still small compared to the trillions in ETFs and mutual funds.

By Darren Loucaides T here’s a 3D hand on a black screen. J. Galen Buckwalter concentrates on the image, trying to move one of the virtual hand’s fingers — with his mind. For more than 50 years, Buckwalter hasn’t felt his fingers after breaking his neck in an accident as a teenager. But today, thanks to a research lab at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) that implanted him with a brain computer interface (BCI), Buckwalter is a pioneer exploring the frontiers of brain science. Buckwalter only needed a couple of sessions to master the control of a computer cursor — some participants needed much longer. Now he attempts to move two fingers and a thumb. A large blue dot slides back and forth over the virtual index finger as he tries to coax it to life. Eventually he can move all three digits — and can actually feel the virtual fingers he’s trying to move. “That was the ‘holy shit’ moment, that this really feels like my hand,” Buckwalter says with a grin in a video call. It may seem like a small step, but this was a giant leap for Buckwalter, 69, the self-proclaimed “neuronaut.” The Caltech lab where Buckwalter is a participant is run by Richard Andersen, 74, one of the world’s foremost neuroscientists who has been working on implants for decades. His lab is currently studying five humans with long-term brain implants. These participants have moved objects with robotic arms, operated semi-autonomous cars as part of an experiment in collaboration with Ford, and even felt natural touch again. Brain implants are very much part of the popular imagination right now — the hit show Severance fictionalizes a worst-case scenario for the technology — and Elon Musk’s BCI company Neuralink has swallowed most of the news attention, like the videos of Neuralink’s participants playing video games and moving robotic arms. But Neuralink’s headline-grabbing work builds on the painstaking achievements of research labs like Caltech’s. “The BCI companies of today are standing on the shoulders of academic giants who have been developing BCIs for decades,” says Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century Musk’s goal for his company also diverges from his academic forbearers. The world’s richest man is explicitly focused on “enhancement” — his sci-fi dream is to turn BCIs into mass products for able-bodied people, merging our brains with computers. While academic labs like Caltech are focused on better understanding the brain so they can help people with conditions like Buckwalter’s, Musk wants to give people superhuman vision and total recall: “If it’s extremely safe, and you can have superhuman abilities, and let’s say you can upload your memories, so you wouldn’t lose memories, then I think probably a lot of people would choose to have it,” he told podcaster Lex Fridman last year. “It would supersede the cellphone, for example.” Neuralink’s staff has basically said that they don’t need to understand how the brain works to roll out this cyborg future. To those in the know, this seems short-sighted. “New knowledge of how the brain works leads to more advanced neural prosthetics,” as Andersen says. Musk’s pushy approach also risks setting back this work at a crucial moment, according to others in the field.

But they point to “crazy pressure from the top,” while raising some of the same concerns highlighted in a 2020 STAT News investigation that reported a “chaotic internal culture” and a Reuters 2023 report on “tensions inside Neuralink over development pace.” Neuralink and Musk did not respond to a detailed list of questions from Rolling Stone. Current individual employees also did not respond to requests for comment for this piece. With Musk’s recent cost-cutting role in government — already linked to the firing of those in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including some staff overseeing Neuralink’s clinical trial applications — there’s more attention on the company than ever, with some wondering if the guardrails have come off. IN JULY 2019, MUSK strode onstage in San Francisco wearing a suit with a white shirt, no tie, to make his first presentation about Neuralink. While the first human volunteers would be paralyzed patients, the ultimate goal was to avoid mankind being “left behind” by advancing tech, namely AI. “This is going to sound pretty weird,” he said, shoulders hunched, but the objective was to achieve “symbiosis with artificial intelligence.” He added: “This is extremely important.” The following year, in an interview with Joe Rogan, Musk made an even bigger claim: Implantees would be able to “save state” like in a video game, enabling someone to “restore that state into a biological being if you wanted to in the future.” Despite Musk’s interventions bringing the field an unprecedented level of prominence in the media, brain implants have been around for decades. In the 1960s, neurophysiologist José Delgado implanted bulls with wireless devices to stop them in their tracks as they charged toward him. In 1973, University of California in Los Angeles’ Jacques Vidal, who coined the term “brain-computer interface,” used noninvasive electroencephalograms (EEGs) — small sensors applied to the scalp — to allow participants to control a cursor-like object on a computer screen. There followed considerable public blowback over fears of mind control, particularly as the Soviet Union conducted its own research. Only in the 1990s did the pace pick up again, including the development of the microelectrode platform called the Utah Array. In 2004, Matt Nagle became the first paralyzed person to be implanted with the Utah Array, enabling him to move a cursor, check email, operate a TV, and open and close a prosthetic hand. The Utah Array would become the gold standard for BCIs, used in many academic research labs. Musk wanted to popularize a different kind of brain implant — one that was wireless. In 2016, Musk founded Neuralink with eight engineers and neuroscientists, including Philip Sabes, a professor emeritus at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF); Sabes had been working at UCSF on thin-film electrodes that could be robotically implanted at the micron-scale using a “sewing machine.” Although Neuralink was registered as a “medical research” company, a key goal was human-AI integration, as later specified by Musk in a conversation with Wait But Why blogger and author Tim Urban. At times in the years since Neuralink’s founding, Musk was reportedly frustrated by the company’s progress. Before Neuralink could work with humans, it had to conduct extensive trials with animals. To begin with, this mostly involved rats. In his 2019 presentation, Musk revealed Neuralink had started testing primates, too. “A monkey has been able to control the computer with his brain. Just FYI,” he claimed. Accusations of animal cruelty led to a federal probe in 2022 for violations of the Animal Welfare Act. According to Reuters, which cited documents and interviews with 20 current and former employees, excessive pressure and rushed timelines resulted in botched experiments causing the deaths of at least 1,500 animals — including monkeys, sheep, and pigs — over a four-year period. Neuralink denied the animal cruelty claims at the time. (In July 2023, the federal probe found no breaches of animal welfare rules apart from a 2019 incident the company had already reported.) In 2023, Neuralink got permission from the FDA to begin testing with humans. That year, Neuralink raised around $325 million from investors who valued the company in excess of $3 billion. In 2024, Neuralink announced its first human participant: Noland Arbaugh, a thirtysomething quadriplegic, was implanted with a wireless chip smaller and supposedly more powerful than the Utah Array. Although far less invasive than procedures at labs like Caltech’s, Neuralink’s implant still involved a small part of the skull being permanently removed; the implant sits in this space with a flap of skin on top. A neurosurgeon oversaw the robot’s surgery, but the company’s ultimate goal is to fully automate the procedure. With practice, Arbaugh was able to use the BCI to control a computer cursor and play video games. But there were problems. Only a month after his surgery, around 85 percent of the threads implanted in his brain had come loose. In August 2024, it announced a second participant, implanted with a more advanced chip that enabled him to design 3D objects using computer-aided design software. In late January, Neuralink posted a clip of a robotic arm writing on a whiteboard, supposedly under the control of a third participant, and on April 27, Musk shared a video of this participant, who has ALS and is unable to speak, describing how his implant had enabled him to communicate again via a computer. More recently, the number of patients has accelerated, with Neuralink claiming it now has nine human participants. Like studies at academic labs, all of Neuralink’s participants are paralyzed. While Musk has more recently hailed the potential for Neuralink to restore a person’s ability to walk or even cure their dementia, he has more often alluded to a different objective. During an hourlong presentation in July 2024, Musk claimed that anyone with his implants would soon be able to communicate faster than a person with a fully functional body. “We want to give people superpowers,” he said. SO FAR, NEURALINK HAS LARGELY built on achievements already demonstrated in the field — cursor control, click control, and robotic arm control. “How I would see it is they’re basically checking off these milestones,” the expert in touch with Neuralink staff tells Rolling Stone. “Everything Musk does attracts an outsized level of attention…. I think most scientists prefer other people to measure the significance of their work, whereas Musk is doing the opposite, and labeling everything he’s done as brand new and significant.” There are unique elements to Neuralink’s BCI, such as the robotic surgery used to implant it, as well as the wireless technology. But other companies use even less-invasive methods. Precision Neuroscience, founded by a former Neuralink co-founder, has developed a flexible electrode array thinner than a human hair, which the company describes as “minimally invasive.” Synchron is testing a device that’s inserted into the brain through a blood vessel; the company also uses a generative chat feature powered by OpenAI to assist relevant participants with communication (it was recently reported that OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman is raising funds for a BCI startup that would compete with Neuralink). And the method of implanting electrode threads into the cortex was first developed by Philip Sabes while he worked at UCSF, before he left and co-founded Neuralink. There are also downsides to going wireless. Caltech postdoc David Bjånes notes that, while Neuralink’s device records neurons from more channels than, for example, the 384 channels provided by six Utah Arrays as in Buckwalter’s case, it currently only records from one brain area — by contrast, Caltech’s devices record from five brain areas concurrently. With different participants having implants in different parts of the brain, the researchers have a more holistic view of how the brain performs various functions. Neuralink’s device also transmits a compressed version of its brain signal due to bandwidth limitations from being wireless, whereas Caltech can record uncompressed, high bandwidth broadband signals on all their channels. “As a scientist, I am not willing to sacrifice signal if I don’t have to,” Bjånes says. “A wired solution that gives me as much signal as possible — I’m going to choose that every time over another technology.” For patients, there’s a huge advantage to a wireless BCI, but that comes at the expense of gaining new knowledge about the brain that can help future patients. “I think the wireless technology will get there,” Bjånes says. “It just is not quite mature enough.” Previously, Neuralink has been pilloried for its lack of transparency. After Musk announced on X in January 2024 that the first human had been implanted with Neuralink’s device, experts in the field and former regulatory staff expressed concerns at the piecemeal doling out of information, with specific criticism for not registering its trial at the National Institute of Health’s website ClinicalTrials.gov — a common practice even for so-called “early feasibility” devices like Neuralink’s. Medical ethicists described Neuralink’s and Musk’s approach as “science by press release.” In May, Neuralink did register on ClinicalTrials.gov and has since shared more details of its studies. But it’s still unclear, for example, how its robotic surgery exactly works, at least to anyone outside Neuralink. And as Musk continues to make bold claims in an increasingly competitive field, experts note that, given past concerns raised by Neuralink employees, something could go wrong and set the field back years both in terms of willing participants and private investors due to the long shadow Musk casts. “The ‘move fast, break things, and fix it later’ philosophy of Big Tech is going to be disastrous if applied to BCIs,” says Rajesh Rao, the University of Washington professor, who argues that commercial companies like Neuralink should embed ethicists in their teams. A former Neuralink engineer tells Rolling Stone it is “hard for anything to advance super fast for a class 3 medical device,” noting that every advance takes “immense effort,” testing and preclinical/clinical trials. And they claim the company moves fast “without compromising safety.” Even so, concerns about Neuralink’s impact on the field only grew in the wake of Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) instigating mass layoffs of federal staff, some directly impacting Neuralink. This sparked concern that guardrails around approval for Neuralink trials had been removed. Phyllis Fong, the USDA’s longtime inspector general who launched the ongoing probe into Neuralink for alleged animal cruelty, was forced out of her job in January. In mid-February, 20 staff members in the FDA office of neurological and physical medicine devices, including several who oversaw Neuralink, were also fired. (Shortly after layoffs in the FDA, hundreds were reportedly asked to rejoin, though it is unclear if any staff specifically reviewing Neuralink were rehired.) The cuts included reviewers overseeing clinical-trial applications by Neuralink and other companies creating BCI devices. (In April, Neuralink also falsely self-certified as a “small disadvantaged business” on a federal filing, qualifying Musk’s company for funding aimed at promoting racial and ethnic diversity. As of this summer, there wasn’t evidence that they’d received the funding.) In response to criticism that Musk was removing officials responsible for regulating his companies, the White House insisted at the time that he had pledged to avoid conflicts of interest. BUCKWALTER WAS ONLY 17 when he leapt from high rocks into the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, breaking his neck and doing irreparable damage to his spinal cord. He spent a year in a state hospital for what were then called “crippled” children. While some of the other injured kids were in and out within a month, Buckwalter’s convalescence was slow. “I kind of had to stumble my way along,” he says. “It was the dark ages of rehabilitation medicine.” But Buckwalter did find his way, and he has gone on to live a full life by any measure. He ended up being a researcher for 15 years, writing a paper on estrogen replacement therapy for women diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease that is still cited often, as is his groundbreaking research into so-called “mommy brain” cognition during pregnancy, which landed him on morning news shows in the 1990s. Buckwalter conducted initial research and wrote the matching algorithm for the dating website eHarmony, founded in 2000. For a quarter century, Buckwalter has also been the frontman of a David Bowie-inspired rock band called Siggy, which still performs live. Many quadriplegics don’t make it to Buckwalter’s age. “Fifty years post-spinal cord injury is a pretty small population of folks,” he says. In 2023, a friend and colleague who had a neuroscience Ph.D. from Caltech told him about a lab at the private university in Pasadena researching brain implants. The surgery itself involved cutting into Buckwalter’s skull to install six Utah arrays. The implants are designed to both “read” and “write”: The electrodes record neurons firing as well as stimulating activity. Buckwalter’s pioneering case also involves the world’s first chronic implant inside the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, where high-level reasoning and possible participation in language takes place. Even in the inherently more cautious academic sphere of BCIs, there are challenges for participants like Buckwalter. After falling earlier this year, he fractured his femur and damaged one of the pedestals protruding from his head, and it has taken Caltech’s neurosurgeons some time to bring the affected arrays online. He has also belatedly realized he doesn’t technically have ownership of his data — the information gathered from his brain by the arrays during lab work with Caltech — which complicates a proposed collaboration over the creation of a virtual clone of Buckwalter with a former student of his, Thomas Parsons, working in AI at Arizona State University. Parsons has been scraping anything Buckwalter has ever written or said on record to integrate into a large language model. This plan is to have Buckwalter’s BCI interact directly with his virtual clone, offering unprecedented insights into the holy grail of neuroscience — the mechanics of consciousness itself. But if Buckwalter can’t access his Caltech data, the ambitious project may be imperilled. Buckwalter and other brain implantees are now trying to collectively organize behind a so-called BCI Pioneers manifesto, and are working with an attorney on a consent form addendum for all brain implant procedures. Buckwalter has proposed the catchy slogan: “My brain, my data.” THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENCES between academic researchers and commercial companies — and yet the fates of both are bound together. “The failure and success of any one of us is all of ours,” Bjånes says. One way of warding off this danger could be by greater collaboration between companies and academic research labs. One company, Onward Medical, collaborates with Rao’s center at the University of Washington, and another called Blackrock Neurotech, which produces the Utah Array, collaborates with multiple research labs. Neuralink has made no such collaboration public. Experts speaking to Rolling Stone say Neuralink clearly has an important role to play in the field’s future, both in raising public awareness and the transformative potential of the company achieving its goal of implanting thousands of humans. “Neuralink’s strength is in its ability to commercialize such an intricate piece of tech,” says the ex-Neuralink engineer. “Sure, this has existed in labs, but no one can feasibly bring it to market at scale.” Currently only a handful of participants are signed up to each academic research lab. If Neuralink’s work means there are many more participants with BCIs, and Musk releases the API to enable other researchers to access the data, it could be a game changer. Given Neuralink’s relative opacity, that seems unlikely. At the same time, Musk continues to make fantastical-sounding claims. Last year he predicted that within two decades, hundreds of millions of people would be using Neuralink’s implants. He envisions a future in which his company inaugurates superhuman cyborgs — a techno-dystopian “symbiosis” with machines and artificial intelligence. AI has an important role to play with BCIs, particularly via the use of large language models (LLM) to assist the decoding of speech, learning an individual’s repeated patterns of speech and generating a voice that sounds like their own. AI has also helped patients communicate as with rival company Synchron’s OpenAI-powered generative chat feature. Musk’s leading contribution to the AI field so far has been Grok. But his X-native chatbot has repeatedly caused controversy, whether ranting about “white genocide” in South Africa or praising Hitler, and replying to users with antisemitic comments. There may be reason to fear what Musk could do with experimental brain tech after seeing how Grok has turned out. Meanwhile, Musk’s big claims about brain implants’ potential could end up triggering a public backlash as was seen in the 1970s. They even highlight a rift in President Trump’s coalition between the tech right and those wary of Big Tech. Former top Trump strategist Steve Bannon, a staunch critic of Musk’s transhumanist philosophy, warned in January that within 10 years, brain chips would threaten humanity as we know it, as people could face a dilemma over whether to enhance themselves or fall behind peers.

Then He Smuggled $500 Million Worth of Cocaine in One Night UCSF’s Edward Chang sees his lab’s place in the field as distinct from many commercial companies. “My goal, ultimately, is quite different,” he says. Instead of Musk’s sci-fi enhancement dream, Chang’s research seeks new knowledge that can relieve the suffering of his patients, and even more importantly, “trying to understand who we are as humans,” he says. “I think ultimately, that’s a much more ambitious goal than enhancement.” Using BCIs to advance our understanding of the brain comes at a moment when artificial intelligence also poses existential questions for humanity. As Chang says, “I personally think that it’s more important than ever, actually, to understand what makes us human.” photographs in illustration by JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images; Adobe Stock, 2 We want to hear it.

Solana (SOL) has solidified its position among the world’s largest cryptocurrencies, surpassing Binance Coin (BNB) to secure the fifth spot by market capitalization. As of September 12, 2025, SOL trades at $ 237.90, giving it a market capitalization of $126.4 billion. The rally marks a 6.8% gain in the past 24 hours and over 15% weekly growth, driven by surging institutional interest and strong on-chain activity. Analysts stress three key catalysts behind Solana’s momentum: Nasdaq’s approval of a Solana-focused listing, growing speculation over spot ETFs, and continuous network upgrades that strengthen its position as Ethereum’s closest competitor. A major driver of the rally was Galaxy Digital’s reported purchase of 2.31 million SOL tokens worth nearly $536 million within 24 hours. Blockchain data confirms transfers from Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit to Galaxy-controlled wallets, fueling speculation that the firm is aggressively backing Solana’s growth. This move follows Galaxy’s leadership in a $1.65 billion private placement for Forward Industries (NASDAQ: FORD), which is transitioning into a Solana-focused digital asset treasury. Forward’s stock soared 135% in five days, proving investor excitement. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz declared the start of a “Solana Season,” citing regulatory progress, ETF optimism, and Solana’s unmatched scalability as reasons for the aggressive accumulation. ETF speculation continues to boost Solana’s appeal. Reports suggest a 90% chance of a Solana ETF approval by late 2025, with applications from VanEck and Fidelity already in review. With staking yields around 7%, analysts believe Solana is well-positioned to attract yield-focused ETF structures. Meanwhile, Solana’s network fundamentals remain robust. August data shows 58 million monthly active users and $15.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), fueled by activity across DeFi, NFTs, and memecoins. Recent upgrades, including the Alpenglow upgrade and the upcoming Firedancer client, promise greater scalability and reduced congestion. With institutional capital flooding in, ETF approvals on the horizon, and technical upgrades boosting performance, Solana’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. Analysts now eye potential price targets between $300 and $400 in the coming months if bullish conditions persist. Cover image from ChatGPT, SOLUSD For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Should You Invest in the TIAA Real Estate Account (QREARX)?
URL: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/qrearx-tiaa-real-estate/
Time Published: 2025-09-13T06:30:20Z
Full Content:
I get asked lots of questions about specific investments. Mostly, the question is asking me to look into my crystal ball and tell them what will provide the best return over their investment period. Aside from the fact that I'm not licensed to recommend specific investments (or paid to do so; even for our real estate sponsors, we only introduce, not recommend), the main issue here is that my crystal ball is usually about as cloudy as that of the person asking the question. However, I get this particular version of the question often enough that it seemed worth a blog post. “I practice in an academic setting and, like many of us at academic institutions, I have access to TIAA’s Real Estate Account. I have not been able to find any high-quality reviews of this account to help decide if it is worth investing in, and I was wondering if your team would be up for writing an article about it to provide us with your insight. Some questions that come to mind are whether it is a good investment compared to other direct real estate investing opportunities, if TIAA is considered competitive as an investing institution in the real estate world, and if the benefits of being able to invest in it in a 403(b) outweigh the tax benefits real estate investments offer investors in taxable accounts.” I have known about the TIAA Real Estate Account (fund) for decades, although I admit I don't follow it particularly closely, as it has never been accessible to me as an investment. TIAA-CREF provides a lot of 403(b)s across the country to academics, teachers, and others, and it is generally considered one of the better retirement account providers—or at least it was a decade or two ago before investing became pretty much free with the advent of sub-10 basis point index funds from providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, Blackrock, and more. The draw of the TIAA fund is that it provides DIRECT investments into real estate, rather than just buying shares of publicly traded REITs. That means there is one less layer between you and the actual investment. Presumably, that would reduce costs and reduce volatility and correlation with the overall stock market, like other direct real estate investments. Of course, one can very reasonably argue that the volatility of private real estate isn't reduced; it's just hidden due to assets not being marked to market regularly. Presumably, QREARX does have to mark to market more regularly than most direct investments, given its high liquidity. When I first learned about this fund two decades ago, I heard people speak positively about it and assumed it was pretty good, but then I forgot about it because I never had a 403(b) with access to it. Imagine my surprise when I looked it up and learned that maybe it wasn't all that awesome. Take a look at this chart from Morningstar accessed in May 2025. The top line is fund performance, and the third line is the performance of its category. See what I mean? Ten-year returns of 3% and even 15-year returns of 6% are pretty hard to get excited about. Real estate hasn't done as well as US large cap tech stocks over the last 15 years, but it hasn't been a bad asset class in which to invest. Let's compare it to my preferred publicly traded real estate investment, the Vanguard Real Estate Index fund (VNQ). This fund/ETF owns all the equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) traded on US markets. That 1.5% lower per year (15-year returns of 7.73% vs. 6.20%) isn't as bad as I expected, but it's still a substantial underperformance. It looks even worse over the last five years with an underperformance of 6.5% a year. It really makes you wonder what has been happening at QREARX in the last five years. Like private real estate investments, QREARX isn't marked to market as quickly as VNQ. I'm not surprised to see the delay in the poor returns, just as we saw with MANY private real estate investments that had rough years in 2023 and 2024, especially when compared to the overall stock market. QREARX VNQ If you read its documents, you can learn a lot about how an account/fund/annuity/whatever actually operates. Let me quote from it: “The Real Estate Account is designed as an option for retirement and tax-deferred savings plans for employees of non-profit and governmental institutions. Investment Objective: The Real Estate Account seeks to generate favorable total returns primarily through the rental income and appreciation of a diversified portfolio of directly held, private real estate investments and real estate-related investments, while offering investors guaranteed, daily liquidity. Investment Strategy: Real Estate-Related Investments. The Account intends to have between 75% and 85% of its net assets invested directly in real estate or real estate-related investments with the goal of producing favorable long-term returns primarily through rental income and appreciation. These investments may consist of: The Account’s principal strategy is to purchase direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate, including the four primary sectors of office, industrial, retail, and multi-family, and alternative real estate sectors (defined as real estate outside of the four primary sectors noted above). In addition, the Account is authorized to hold up to 25% of its net assets in liquid real estate-related securities, including publicly traded REITs and CMBS. Management intends that the Account will not hold more than 10% of net assets in such securities on a long-term basis. As of December 31, 2024, the Account did not hold any publicly traded REITs or CMBS.” The document also notes that 15%-25% of the fund's money can be invested in liquid securities like Treasury bonds and money market funds. More information here: How to Start Investing in Real Estate The Tax-Advantaged Income from Our Passive Real Estate Investments I'm sure plenty of people love investing in QREARX. It has $22.6 billion in it. Let's consider what they probably like. The first pro of QREARX is that it provides you with a way to invest in real estate in your TIAA-CREF 403(b). You'll enjoy some tax efficiency from having your real estate investment in a retirement account. And if a huge chunk of your money is in this account, it may be the only way to have a substantial real estate investment in your portfolio. The second pro of QREARX is that it allows you to invest more directly in real estate than via a REIT mutual fund, such as VNQ. That likely results in less volatility. Of course, that works both ways. In 2021, VNQ was up 41%, but QREARX was only up 18%. On the downside, VNQ dropped 26% in 2022, and QREARX only dropped 17% across 2023-2024. All else equal, lower volatility is good. QREARX provides daily liquidity, like a typical mutual fund. That's very different from most direct real estate investments, which are generally private and offer much less liquidity. However, it does limit you to transacting once a quarter (presumably to prevent market timing) on the day of your choice. This account has only been around since 1995, but frankly, that's an eternity in the private real estate space. Few syndicators and private fund managers have been in business anywhere near that long (blog sponsor MLG is a notable exception). And TIAA itself has been around for more than a century (1918). Like investing in VNQ, you don't have to spend a lot of time worrying about being the victim of a scam here or TIAA going bankrupt. That's often not the case in the private real estate world. This investment is in your 403(b), so there is zero tax preparation required for it. That's definitely NOT the case for a portfolio of syndications or funds sending you multi-state K-1s or having to file multiple Schedule Es each year for your direct real estate investments. VNQ is just as passive as QREARX, and many private funds are similarly passive, at least after the initial due diligence. But lots of real estate takes a whole lot more work than that. Like any investment, there are pros AND cons. QREARX is no different. But the cons depend on your comparison. You have to invest in SOMETHING. Although all real estate is optional, it seemed most reasonable to compare it to the other real estate investments typically used by white coat investors rather than stocks, bonds, or some other asset class. These include public REITs via something like VNQ, passive private syndications and funds similar to those on our real estate sponsor list, and truly direct ownership of income-producing rental property (aka landlording) like we teach in our No Hype Real Estate Investment online course. Investing in VNQ, like most Vanguard index funds, is awfully close to free. The expense ratio is 0.13%. That's not the 0-5 basis points you see on a total stock market fund these days, but it's still a whole lot closer to free than most funds charge. On the other hand, QREARX charges more or less the classic “1% a year.” In fact, it's slightly more at 1.015% a year. Those fees/expenses have to come from your returns. There is no other place to take them from. Fee comparison with private passive investments is a lot more challenging. At first glance, they seem a lot higher—often something like 1% plus 20% of returns above 8% or so. But you have to keep in mind that some of those fees are often going to the expenses of running the investment itself. Those expenses aren't included in the ER of VNQ. It's not entirely clear how operating expenses show up with QREARX. Some private investments (like the DLP funds) don't charge you any fees until you've received your preferred return. QREARX isn't offering anything like that. I'm not sure how else to describe the last decade or two of returns for the TIAA Real Estate Account. They're obviously lower than those provided by the even more liquid and significantly cheaper VNQ. They also seem to be quite a bit lower than the returns offered by most passive private real estate investments. Let's compare a somewhat similar investment, the DLP Housing Fund. This fund isn't as liquid, although it does offer more liquidity (annual redemptions) than most private real estate investments. It is, like QREARX, evergreen—also unlike most real estate investments. How has it been doing the last few years? Let's take a look. Unfortunately, Morningstar doesn't make a nice little graph every day for private real estate investments, but I carefully track my own returns in all of these investments. I invested $250,000 in this fund in June 2021 and have an annualized return from then until the end of April 2025 of 13% a year. By year, the returns look like this: Needless to say, 13% is way better than whatever QREARX has done over that time period—perhaps by as much as 11%-12% a year. They're both actively managed real estate funds and past performance doesn't necessarily indicate future performance, but you do have to ask yourself how much you trust the QREARX manager to do better after an underperformance like that. Even if I had just gone with VNQ, I'd be significantly ahead of QREARX. I could have taken less risk, too, and done better. Real estate debt funds have performed just fine over the last five years. We own three of them (including the DLP Lending Fund), and our returns for that asset class are a very stable 9.56% per year since we started investing in it in 2017. Now, not every private real estate turned in better performance than QREARX, but most of mine did. While it's not necessarily an indicator of future performance, low returns may be my biggest con about the TIAA Real Estate Account. QREARX may be available to you. But it's not available to me or most white coat investors—at least not without changing jobs or at least opening an IRA with TIAA-CREF. You can probably only put as much money in it as you have in your TIAA 403(b). Unlike a private equity real estate investment, you can't put it in a taxable account and enjoy passive income sheltered by depreciation. And if you use your 403(b) space for real estate, that means you can't put something else (bonds?) in there. More information here: How the IRS Treats You as a Real Estate Investor The 60+ Worst Mistakes You Can Make in Real Estate Investing While I find the concept of a liquid direct real estate investment available to non-accredited investors in their employer-provided retirement accounts very interesting, it's hard for me to get over the additional expenses and lower returns seen with QREARX. And if you're really interested in putting in some time and effort into real estate investing, you're probably not going to end up in this fund. What do you think? Do you invest in the TIAA Real Estate Account? Why or why not? What do you like/dislike about it? I was curious why QREARX has such middling returns even compared to VNQ and did a little digging. I think it might be because it is relatively conservative in its loan-to-value ratio. From the fund’s 8-K: “As of March 31, 2025, the Account’s loan-to-value ratio was approximately 18.0%.” https://www.tiaa.org/public/pdf/performance/REA_FAQ.pdf For comparison, the three largest REITS in VNQ are WELL (debt to equity of 0.45), PLD (debt to equity of around 0.6) and AMT (leverage ratio of 5.1). All have much higher internal leverage. 18% LTV is extremely conservative in the real estate investing world. My university notified employees that TIAA is facing a class action suit for rigging their retirement calculator to nearly always recommend their annuities and their real estate fund. I had tried out the calculator using several risk strategies and was surprised that it recommended those investments even when this made no sense. I, for example, have plenty of savings to replace my income at retirement and also have a real estate partnership and age 70 SS funding—the calculator still recommended both funds. Interesting.

The world’s largest asset manager will announce a data centre partnership with Digital Gravity Partners, one of a string of deals to be announced during President Trump’s state visit, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 13 September 2025 06:32, UK The world’s largest money manager will use President Trump’s state visit to the UK next week to unveil a £500m plan to invest in UK data centres, one of the fastest-growing areas of global infrastructure spending. Sky News has learnt that BlackRock plans to announce a joint venture with Digital Gravity Partners, a digital infrastructure investment manager, that will focus on acquiring and modernising existing data centres to improve their capacity. The project will be among dozens hailed by the government as evidence of the strength of the economic partnership between Britain and the US, as President Trump arrives in the UK against the politically tumultuous backdrop of Lord Mandelson's sacking as the US ambassador. BlackRock, which has more than $12.5 trillion in assets under management, has a significant presence in Britain, and will next week open a new Edinburgh office employing about 1,300 people. Earlier this week, Sky News revealed that Larry Fink, BlackRock's chairman and chief executive, would be part of the business delegation accompanying President Trump on the state visit. Other bosses in attendance will include Jensen Huang of Nvidia, the world's most valuable public company, and Sam Altman of ChatGPT architect OpenAI. Bloomberg News reported on Friday that the two companies would launch a multibillion-pound investment in the UK next week that will form part of the vast $500bn Stargate data centre project. Trump sues New York Times Face-to-face with Zelenskyy, his frustration with the West is clear Zelenskyy demands 'clear position' from Trump on ending war The vast quantities being spent on artificial intelligence-related data centre infrastructure around the world represents one of the most important trends in the global economy, with the attendant strains on power resources also being throw into sharp focus. The government hopes to announce early next week aggregate figures for investment and job creation that will rival the £63bn it claimed to have secured as a result of last October's International Investment Summit, according to insiders. Critically, at a difficult time for an economy which official data shows is flat lining, the string of major corporate announcements will be hailed by Sir Keir Starmer's administration as evidence that Britain remains a top global destination for foreign investment. The Office for Investment, which was recently given a beefed-up role in Whitehall, has been involved in coordinating many of the deals to be announced next week, which will encompass energy, financial services, nuclear power and technology, according to insiders. Corporate and Whitehall sources said that BlackRock's £500m data centre deal would reflect the efforts of the prime minister, his business adviser Varun Chandra and chancellor Rachel Reeves to strengthen the government's relationship with the asset management behemoth during the last year.

President Trump's visit will, however, come amid tensions over his tariff regime, with continuing uncertainty about the impact on British manufacturing sectors, including steel. There are also continuing tensions between the UK government and major drugmakers over pricing, with the US administration pressuring pharmaceutical companies to slash the price of prescription medicines in the US. BlackRock declined to comment.

Title: Return of ‘world class’ Aoife Wafer just what the doctor ordered ahead of France clash
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/09/13/return-of-world-class-aoife-wafer-just-what-the-doctor-ordered-ahead-of-france-clash/
Time Published: 2025-09-13T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
She’s only 22 and she has only played 15 Tests, but Aoife Wafer’s name stands out above all others in the Ireland team to play France in Sunday’s World Cup quarter-final (Sandy Park, Exeter, kick-off 1pm). Of course, this is largely because of her long-awaited return from knee surgery in July. But it’s not just that. When the former Irish player Jenny Murphy underlined the importance of Wafer’s return by simply describing her as “world class” on Second Captains this week, it wasn’t remotely wide of the mark. After all, Wafer has been named on the World Dream Team and was also the RPI’s Players’ Player of the Year and Young Player of the year in 2024. That all came before her coronation as the 2025 Six Nations Player of the Championship. She earned the latter honour despite missing the last-day loss to Scotland. In four games, Wafer scored four tries, which was the joint highest for a forward. She made 70 carries – the most of any player in the tournament – for a staggering 424.7 metres and beat 17 defenders, the second highest of any forward. Her two tries inspired the 36-10 statement win over Australia in Belfast at the start of last season, as did her two early tries in the ensuing win over New Zealand at WXV1 in Vancouver – powering over first from a tap penalty and then off a five-metre scrum. While this team has strong carriers in Brittany Hogan and Grace Moore, it’s doubtful any other Irish player would have scored them. Similarly, Wafer’s two tries inspired the comeback which came up just short against France in Belfast last March but which fuels belief ahead of this quarter-final, as well as another brace in the win over Wales. It’s not just the tries. Wafer can bend games to her sheer will with her carrying beyond contact, turnovers and tackling, It’s a huge ask, no doubt, for Wafer to magically rediscover her best rugby in a first outing since April, but it’s a gamble worth taking. Better to get 50 or 60 minutes out of her from the start than 20 or 30 at the end, and maybe wonder what might have been. Besides, as former Ireland international Alan Quinlan suggested during the week, the Irish management may well have opted to increase Wafer’s training load last week in preference to giving her a cameo off the bench against New Zealand last Sunday. As with this World Cup and her career, it’s clear that Wafer’s athleticism, strength and footballing ability has been fuelled by a fierce competitive nature and passion for the game, as well as her rugby roots. From Ballygarrett in Wexford, Wafer and her younger sister Orla used to watch their two older brothers play rugby in Gorey RFC. One of the boys, Sean, played for a Leinster Under-18s club side. She eventually nagged their mother Samantha into letting her play as well. Wafer also recalls passing time in the car one day with her brothers by naming as many Irish players as they could. “They were there naming Johnny Sexton, Brian O’Driscoll and all these big names in the men’s team and I named the whole women’s panel. It was a 38-player squad and I named every single one of them. They just sat there and said ‘no, you can’t do it that like’.” In the days before replica women’s jerseys could be bought, the former Ireland women’s coach Philip ‘Goose’ Doyle sent an autographed Irish jersey to Wafer for her tenth birthday. It has been hanging on her bedroom wall ever since and has since been joined by one of her own. At 12, she stopped playing with the boys team in Gorey and transferred to the girls’ Under-15 team before moving to Enniscorthy RFC at 18. It was an important staging post where she switched from a bossy little scrumhalf to a backrower, before moving on to Blackrock and Leinster. On foot of captaining the Ireland Under-18 side, her mother received a call from the IRFU offering Wafer a full-time contract with the Ireland sevens. She relayed that news to her daughter after collecting her from school. It came with a proviso that she first complete her Leaving Cert. That was fine by her. Wafer always wanted to go into healthcare in either medicine or physiotherapy and duly studied the latter in UCD. Alas, days after her Ireland XVs debut in the 2022 Six Nations against Italy in Musgrave Park, the then 19-year-old tore her hamstring in sevens training. Between that and other things, Wafer didn’t win her second cap for another 560 days. That came as a replacement in the WXV 15-13 win against Spain in Dubai in 2023. In the 2024 Six Nations, she was twice player of the round before her 2024-25 breakout campaign. She is not shy about stating her desire to become the best player in the world and, to that end, is joining Harlequins this season. They’re in for a treat, not least as she can play the uilleann pipes, tin whistle, classical flute and the traditional flute. She brings her flute or tin whistle on rugby trips. As her Irish debut song, Wafer famously belted out Miley Cyrus’s Party In The USA on the pitch with her teammates. But after a pre-match meal of pancakes and some chill-out music, she’ll listen to a track or two of traditional Irish music. She’s been missed, but she’s back and will revive her familiar matchday routine ahead of this quarter-final. It’s not stretching things to suggest that, with Wafer in the team, Ireland have a better chance of winning it.

Title: Ondo Finance Surges 20% Weekly Amid Hype and Growing DeFi Demand

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ondo Finance (ONDO) has risen as one of the top performers in the market this week, surging 20% to trade around $1.10. The rally comes as demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization accelerates, pushing Ondo’s TVL to record highs. The recently launched Ondo Global Markets platform has been a major growth driver, attracting over $160 million in assets within days. The service enables investors to access tokenized versions of more than 100 stocks and ETFs, including Tesla, Nvidia, and Google. By bringing Wall Street assets onto the blockchain, Ondo is positioning itself as a leader in the $26 billion RWA tokenization market. Analysts argue that this move could transform global investing, particularly for users outside the U.S., who have traditionally faced barriers to stock market participation. Beyond its equities platform, Ondo Finance has seen explosive growth across its ecosystem. TVL on its DeFi protocols has surged from $563 million earlier this year to more than $1.57 billion today. This spike is primarily fueled by Ondo’s yield-bearing products, such as: The firm’s lending arm, Flux, has also expanded rapidly, now managing $42 million in assets compared to just $4 million last November. Like Aave’s Horizon, Flux lets users borrow stablecoins against tokenized U.S. Treasuries, creating new liquidity avenues. Ondo has also launched its own blockchain, tailored for tokenization, which strengthens its moat in a sector projected to reach trillions of dollars in value. Technically, Ondo has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a bullish reversal signal. The token recently broke past the $1.05 resistance and is now eyeing a breakout above $1.145, last seen in July. A successful move could open the door toward $1.18 and even $1.26 in the short term. However, traders are watching closely for profit-taking risks, as ONDO’s relative strength index (RSI) signals overbought conditions. Regardless, with BlackRock signaling blockchain-based ETFs and Fed rate cuts expected to fuel a broader risk rally, momentum could remain in Ondo’s favor. If sustained, Ondo Finance’s surge not only grows its role as a DeFi leader but also builds the fast-growing demand for tokenized real-world assets.

Title: Why ONDO faces bearish risk despite double-digit price gains

ONDO swing traders should be on the lookout for a bearish trend reversal at the key supply zones just above the current market price of $1.08. The launch of Fidelity’s FDIT on-chain money market fund highlighted ONDO’s growing list of top-tier asset manager partnerships, but the price movement in the coming days might not reflect intense bullishness. Major asset managers continued to tokenize traditional financial products. Fidelity launched the Fidelity Digital Interest Token (FDIT) on the 10th of September. It is an on-chain money market fund backed by U.S. Treasuries, mostly from Ondo Finance’s [ONDO] Short-Term U.S. Treasuries Fund (OUSG) as the only anchor and largest investor. In doing so, Fidelity joined BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton in offering tokenized money market or Treasury funds. Since the OUSG launch in June 2023, Ondo Finance was one of the first tokens with on-chain access to U.S. Treasuries. Over the past two days, ONDO has gained 14.1%, rallying from $0.95 to $1.08. Bitcoin [BTC] was up 3.3% and Ethereum [ETH] climbed 5.4% during the same period, helping explain ONDO’s bullish sentiment. However, technical analysis showed that the token was headed toward a supply zone, and traders and investors should be wary of a trend reversal. Source: ONDO/USDT on TradingView The 1-day market structure was bullish, and the key swing high and low were marked in orange. They were at $1.17 and $0.85, respectively, while a range formation (white) was also identified. ONDO has traded within this range since July. At the time of writing, the price was at a key supply zone from mid-August at $1.08. Another 7% move higher would take ONDO to the range highs. However, it was unclear if the current move could reach the range highs. The CMF on the daily timeframe was below -0.05, showing strong capital outflow from the market. Even though the MACD showcased bullish momentum, the seller dominance was not overthrown. Therefore, ONDO swing traders should be on the lookout for a bearish trend reversal at $1.08 and $1.17. Sustained buying pressure and high trading volume alongside a breakout past $1.17 would be a strong bullish signal in the coming weeks, but until then, the range formation would likely be respected.

Title: Estimating MicroStrategy’s Timeline to 1 Million Bitcoin
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2025/09/12/estimating-microstrategys-timeline-to-1-million-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T20:53:34Z

Current Bitcoin Holdings of MicroStrategy MicroStrategy (now rebranded as Strategy Inc. as of early 2025) is the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. As of September 2025, the company holds approximately 638,460 BTC in its treasury . This massive stash – roughly 3% of all bitcoins that will ever exist – reflects an aggressive accumulation strategy that began in 2020 and has accelerated in recent years. MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, has made it clear the company views Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset and has no intention of selling. As Saylor famously stated: “Never. No. We’re not sellers. We’re only acquiring and holding bitcoin… that’s our strategy.” This long-term “HODL” stance underpins MicroStrategy’s goal of continually increasing its bitcoin holdings regardless of market fluctuations. Historical Bitcoin Acquisition Timeline MicroStrategy’s path to 1 million BTC can be understood by looking at how rapidly its holdings have grown: Summary of Holdings by Year: MicroStrategy’s BTC stack grew from ~70k in 2020 to ~447k by end of 2024, and ~638k by late 2025. This exponential trajectory underscores the company’s increasing conviction (and available capital) for Bitcoin acquisitions. Public Statements on Future Bitcoin Plans MicroStrategy’s leadership has been very transparent about their long-term commitment to Bitcoin. Key insights from executives include: In summary, all public communications from MicroStrategy’s team convey unwavering bullishness on Bitcoin and an intention to keep buying for years to come. The company positions itself as a pioneer of the “Bitcoin standard” for corporations, frequently evangelizing Bitcoin’s virtues to other CEOs (e.g. via its annual Bitcoin for Corporations conferences). MicroStrategy’s message: they’re all-in on Bitcoin and still just getting started. Financial Capacity for Future Purchases How can MicroStrategy actually fund a march to 1 million BTC? The company’s financial strategy provides the answer: raise capital aggressively and plow it into Bitcoin. Key elements of their financing capacity include: Bottom Line: MicroStrategy has built an extensive capital arsenal for future Bitcoin purchases – including authorized but unused capacity in the tens of billions of dollars across common and preferred stock programs. In total, by mid-2025 the company had already raised about $47 billion in equity capital over five years for its Bitcoin strategy, and it signaled plans to raise yet more. With these financing mechanisms, MicroStrategy theoretically has the firepower to acquire the remaining Bitcoin needed to reach 1 million BTC (though practical and market constraints, discussed next, will influence the timing). Market Conditions Influencing the Acquisition Rate Several market and macroeconomic factors will affect how quickly MicroStrategy can continue buying Bitcoin and reach 1,000,000 BTC: In summary, favorable market conditions – a rising Bitcoin price, strong investor appetite for MicroStrategy’s stock/preferreds, and accessible capital – would enable MicroStrategy to keep an aggressive pace. Unfavorable conditions – a stagnant or falling BTC price, shareholder fatigue, or tight credit/low equity premiums – could slow the pace. The company’s recent behavior (continuing to buy despite some criticism) suggests that as long as they can secure funding, they will push forward, even if it means weathering short-term stock volatility. Investors should thus expect MicroStrategy to remain a bold buyer, adjusting speed as needed but not fundamentally altering course. Timeline Projections to 1,000,000 BTC Taking into account MicroStrategy’s current holdings (~638k BTC) and its historical and potential acquisition rates, we can outline scenarios for how long it might take to reach 1,000,000 bitcoins. Below we consider a Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive case, based on different annual purchase rates. These scenarios are illustrative – the actual outcome will depend on the factors discussed (market conditions, financing success, etc.): The table below summarizes these scenarios with a simple year-by-year estimate of total BTC holdings, assuming a starting point of ~640k BTC (around late 2025 levels) and constant annual purchase rates in each case: Table: Projected Bitcoin holdings under different annual accumulation scenarios. Bold entries indicate crossing 1,000,000 BTC. Under the Conservative path, MicroStrategy would not hit 1 million BTC within this 5-year window (reaching ~840k by 2029, and only in the early 2030s would it cross seven figures). The Moderate path achieves the milestone by about 2029. The Aggressive path has MicroStrategy breezing past 1 million as early as 2027, and potentially holding 1.3+ million BTC by 2029 if that pace were sustained. It’s important to stress that these are simplified projections. In reality, MicroStrategy’s annual BTC accumulation has varied wildly – from just +8k in 2022 to +234k in 2024 – depending on market opportunities. The company tends to be opportunistic, as seen in late 2024 when it accelerated buys during a Bitcoin price surge and favorable stock conditions. Future purchases will likely come in spurts rather than a steady linear rate. For example, MicroStrategy might conduct another big raise during the next crypto bull run (if Bitcoin, say, pushes well beyond $100k) and add a large block of coins in a short time. Alternatively, if the market is lukewarm, it might accumulate more slowly quarter by quarter. Conclusion How long might it take MicroStrategy to acquire 1,000,000 bitcoins? Based on current holdings (~638k BTC) and past trends, it could be as soon as 2–3 years in a bullish, capital-rich scenario, or closer to 7–10 years under more cautious conditions. MicroStrategy’s own actions suggest a strong desire to reach this milestone sooner rather than later. The company has explicitly built the capacity to raise tens of billions more dollars and has demonstrated willingness to deploy huge sums into Bitcoin at every opportunity. As of early 2025, management said they had already executed $20 billion of a planned $42 billion capital deployment for Bitcoin – well ahead of schedule – indicating an accelerated timeline. Crucially, MicroStrategy’s ability to continue at an aggressive pace will hinge on external factors: the trajectory of Bitcoin’s price, investor tolerance for its high-risk strategy, and macroeconomic liquidity. The firm’s stock performance and status (e.g., inclusion in major indices, or competition from a Bitcoin ETF) will also influence how much fuel it can add to the fire. So far, Saylor and his team have been adept at navigating these factors, keeping MicroStrategy at the forefront of Bitcoin accumulation. If Bitcoin’s market remains strong and MicroStrategy retains investor confidence, reaching 1,000,000 BTC by the latter half of this decade is plausible under an aggressive strategy. In any case, MicroStrategy has cemented itself as a unique corporate entity – essentially a Bitcoin holding company – and its quest for 1 million BTC exemplifies the boldest expression of the “Bitcoin standard” in the corporate world. Every quarter brings them closer to that historic figure. Given the company’s track record and statements, it wouldn’t be surprising if MicroStrategy ultimately becomes the first corporation to hold one million bitcoins, whenever that day comes.

Crypto exchange Gemini hit a $4.4 billion valuation on its Nasdaq debut Friday. At the time of writing, the company’s shares—which trade under the GEMI ticker symbol—are hovering around $34. That’s a 22.6% gain from when the stock began trading. Gemini was founded in 2014 and granted a BitLicense by the New York State Department of Financial Services the following year. The company raised $425 million through its IPO, according to Decrypt calculations based on regulatory filings. Reuters was first to report yesterday that the firm’s IPO was significantly oversubscribed. But there’s been drama brewing between the company’s founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chair nominee Brian Quintenz. The CFTC nominee shared screenshots of a July text thread with Tyler on X. The messages show that Quintenz was contacted about a complaint Gemini filed regarding alleged misconduct at the regulator. Gemini paid $5 million to settle its CFTC lawsuit in January, just a few weeks before the trial was set to begin. But in June, the company’s lawyers filed a complaint alleging the CFTC was wrong to have gone after the exchange in the first place. “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise,” he wrote. “It’s my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the President and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” There were a few people in the thread calling foul on his timing, especially given that his current firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has a large stake in Gemini’s direct competitor, Coinbase. Gemini is the most recent, but not the only crypto company to make its big public debut this week. Crypto lender Figure began trading on the Nasdaq under the FIGR ticker Thursday, seeing shares jump 24%. The firm stepped into public trading with an even bigger, $5.3 billion valuation. Its share price ahead of the closing bell on Friday sits around $33.46, about 33% above its $25 IPO price. “Our IPO showed what’s possible when blockchain meets capital markets: speed, transparency, efficiency,” the company said Friday on X. “IPO day was a celebration of our people, partners, and the vision driving us forward, and we’re even more excited for what’s next.” Figure CEO Michael Tannenbaum told Decrypt that the company is showing Wall Street how blockchains can be used to create more efficient markets for real-world assets, while also helping investors better grasp concepts like tokenization. Tokenization—that is, taking real-world assets such as stocks and creating blockchain-based equivalents—has been getting a lot of buzz lately. According to a recent report in Bloomberg, Blackrock is considering tokenizing its ETFs. No, not just BUIDL, its flagship tokenized fund launched with Securitize in 2024. The scope for this move would be much broader—and bring trillions worth of dollars with it. Even Nasdaq has expressed interest to the SEC in allowing tokenized stocks to trade on its exchanges. The company proposed that issuers would get to opt in to having tokenized versions of their securities trade. Crypto exchange Coinbase has claimed that the SEC has done “irreparable harm” by destroying documents from its Gary Gensler era. "The Gensler SEC destroyed documents they were required to preserve and produce,” Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote on X Thursday, alongside a link to the court filing. “We now have proof from the SEC's own Inspector General." A report last week by the SEC’s Office of the Inspector General found that nearly a year of then-Chairman Gary Gensler's text messages were permanently deleted between October 2022 and September 2023. Coinbase has been pursuing internal SEC documents for a long time through the Freedom of Information Act and sued when the regulator denied its requests.

But maybe the markets shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle’s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure. On the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup’s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup’s appetite — even if it’s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it. Chirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it’s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company’s infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors. “OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.” Some industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company’s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn’t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before and provides the infrastructure for TikTok’s sizable U.S. business. “Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said. But even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain. OpenAI has made a string of infrastructure investment announcements over the past year, each one with an eye-popping price tag. OpenAI has committed to spend around $60 billion a year for compute from Oracle and $10 billion to develop custom AI chips with Broadcom. Meanwhile, OpenAI said in June it hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year. That figure includes revenue from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year. Power is another question, or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute. Industry observers have been predicting a near-term boost for natural gas, though solar and batteries are arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets. Tech companies are also betting big on nuclear. Despite market moving headlines, the energy impact of OpenAI’s anticipated growth isn’t entirely unexpected. Data centers are anticipated to consume 14% of all electricity in the U.S. by 2040, according to a report the Rhodium Group published yesterday. Compute has always been a constraint for AI companies, so much so that investors have bought thousands of Nvidia chips to ensure their startups have access to the power they need. Andreessen Horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20,000 GPUs, while Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross rented access to a 4,000 GPU cluster (though maybe Meta owns that now). But compute is worthless without power. To ensure their data centers remain juiced, large tech companies have been snapping up solar farms, buying nuclear power plants, and inking deals with geothermal startups. So far, OpenAI has been relatively quiet on that front. CEO Sam Altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector, including Oklo, Helion, and Exowatt, but the company itself hasn’t thrown money into the space like Google, Meta, or Amazon. With a 4.5 gigawatt compute deal, that may soon change. The company may play an indirect role, paying Oracle to handle the physical infrastructure — something it has extensive experience with — just as Altman invested in startups aligned with OpenAI’s future power needs. That will leave the company “asset light,” something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software-centric AI startups and not with legacy tech firms, which are burdened with pricey infrastructure.

Photos by Billie Winter For nearly two years, every sunrise in Gaza has brought more death, destruction, and dislocation. To be Palestinian today is to live under unrelenting bombardment, displacement, and starvation, your community rendered a target by an Israeli regime that openly declares its intent of eradication. It is to watch American leaders respond not with outrage but with plans envisioning luxury “Gaza Riviera” resorts and surveillance states on the same land where children’s bones are visible from hunger and their bodies are charred by US-funded bombs. This is not a natural disaster. It is a human-made horror. And yet, to be Palestinian is also to persist. To insist on life in the bowels of doom. To keep organizing, cooking, singing, teaching, and loving because to surrender your humanity is to surrender what can never be taken by force. There is no greater defiance than the will to live, to dance, to gather, even when the world seems indifferent to your existence. That is what makes this year’s second annual Palestine Will Live Forever Festival all the more urgent. It arrives not only as Gaza continues to endure mass death and forced displacement, but as Black, Brown, immigrant, trans, and poor communities across the US face escalating state violence, while reproductive freedom, environmental justice, and democracy itself hang in the balance. Yes, the day will feature an all-star lineup: Macklemore, Prometheus Brown, Fem du lit, Bambu, Jamila Woods, Noura Erakat, Nikkita Oliver, and more, but it is not just a concert. It is a gathering that reminds us that our fates are braided together, that either liberation is collective or it is not at all. Saturday will further testify that our will is not passive. It is the marrow of our survival and the pulse that refuses silence. To love one another in the face of annihilation is a political act. The festival is not merely a celebration; it is a forging. A place where joy becomes a weapon against despair, where solidarity is sharpened into strategy, and where we remember that endurance is not simply to survive, but to triumph. The Stranger spoke with four of this year’s organizers—Maher Joudi, Gabriel Teodros, Nikkita Oliver, and Lexi Peterson-Burge—about what it means to hold space for Palestinian liberation, to model cross-movement solidarity, and to create a festival that feeds the long struggle rather than just marking a single day. The Palestine Will Live Forever Festival takes place Saturday, September 13, from noon to 9 p.m. at Volunteer Park. Tickets are available here. This is the second year of this festival. Every day we’re seeing new horrors in the headlines and on social media. For you all, what was the onus to make sure this happened again? Why was it important to participate—whether organizing, performing, or bringing performers? What was the impetus for doing year two? Maher Joudi: That’s a layered question, man. Personally, even leaving last year, the calls started coming in within a week—people asking if it would happen again. I assumed we’d try to run it back at the start of this year. Then a lot changed with the election of President Trump. We had real conversations about whether it should happen, especially from a safety perspective—this was around when Mahmoud Khalil had just gotten taken. There was a lot to weigh. Ultimately, as a team, we decided it was necessary. Then we talked about intentionality—what this year should look like—because the horrors in Palestine had only gotten worse. And here in the US, our people—Palestinian, Black, Latino, immigrant—were getting taken too. The need for a day like last year’s had grown so much that it felt necessary. Gabriel Teodros: The need to gather—and to normalize resistance—became really clear, especially around the election. Rights were getting stripped at an exponential rate: undocumented people getting snatched, transgender people getting arrested for trying to use the bathroom. The list goes on. If we were going to do the festival—and we should—we wanted it to be about collective liberation, to model how our struggles are connected and our pathways to liberation are bound together. That’s the direction we took. Lexi Peterson-Burge: To be transparent, we as organizers have varied identities, backgrounds, and lived experiences. That informed tough discussions about whether to move forward with a second year. We had hours of conversations about protecting communities and ourselves; about what kind of organizing meets the moment; [about] whether centering joy and a celebration of culture and resistance was appropriate and safe. We asked if it would fill the organizer cup for everyone involved—because our communities were experiencing different kinds of harm at the same time. We landed on this: The source of our communities’ struggles—oppression, genocide, etc.—comes from the same place. The festival could say this isn’t one community’s fight; it’s a collective fight against imperialism and capitalism and all the forces fueling the many ways our communities are being oppressed, historically and now. It gave us a chance to model cross-racial, cross-cultural, cross-movement solidarity—and to center joy as resistance while keeping our people as safe as possible. It took a month or two of serious, hard conversations. I wouldn’t have had it any other way. Nikkita Oliver: I actually stepped back from organizing for a couple months to be sure I was in alignment about why I was participating. “All of us or none of us” is key for me. What’s happening to our communities is due to empire, colonialism, capitalism—rooted in anti-Blackness. Our organizing has to target those structures so we don’t end up with a world where some of us get free at the expense of others. Art and culture are resistance—doing them out loud is resistance. But we have to go further: have present organizing bodies people can plug into. We need not just mobilized communities, but organized communities. So the festival centers intersectionality, resistance, and joy while bringing in those doing hyper-local, national, and global organizing—so when people leave, they have places to plug in. It’s more than a day; it’s a galvanizing moment that feeds the uncelebrated work between the big moments. Having organizers, vendors, and movement workers present helps make that real. There’s so much heaviness, locally, nationally, internationally. How do you balance that while planning an event that centers joy, uplifts, and mobilizes? What has that process been like? Teodros: Helping organize has been a constant reminder of what’s possible—and that we don’t get through this time alone. I’m looking at a screen full of graphics, with Zahyr [Lauren]’s beautiful art staring back at me—what they captured is a reminder of what it’s like when our movements come together. Working on the festival has helped me get through this year emotionally. It’s that daily reminder: it’s collective liberation or not at all. “All of us or none of us”—it’s right there in the name. Peterson-Burge: This year’s been harder for me—energy-wise, emotionally. A lot of organizers burn out, especially those with layered identities who are directly impacted by what’s unfolding. There’s a push-pull: The push is knowing you have to do something to stay whole and authentic, to show up for resistance, joy, and cultural preservation. The pull is that doing this month after month while witnessing harm drains you. Then there’s capitalism—families, bills, survival. Still, I feel obligated to show up for my people. And a big reason I can is this group. We’re honest when something hits hard—“I need a day or two”—and we show up for each other. Without this group, I don’t know that I could keep doing something at this scale right now. Oliver: Last year, the energy to do it came easier—even though it was exhausting. Now it’s a daily barrage: executive orders, neighbors snatched by Gestapo, worsening prison conditions, targeting of gender-expansive trans and queer people, the invisibilizing of Sudan and Congo—so much to hold as an organizer and conscious person. It’s overwhelming. What’s kept me in it is that we’re having the hard conversations—crying with each other, sometimes at each other—and practicing principled struggle. Some won’t see the value because arts and culture are central. I’d argue without arts and culture, we don’t exist—that’s where our stories, histories, poems, relationships live. We engage culture every day—from clothes to music to what we read. Doing principled struggle in a space of art-as-resistance makes me want to keep going, even when it’s exhausting. Also, hearing folks’ energy for it is a reminder of how important gathering is. It’s not always a 3,000-person festival—sometimes it’s dinner, a Zoom, a walk. The constant gathering matters. I’m looking forward to being in community with people who share our values and take this as a call to make our movements as intersectional as possible. Joudi: I agree—this year is harder. I’ve probably had one-on-ones with everyone here saying that. It makes me emotional to hear it out loud. Last year, I was excited—everything was new and fast, and I didn’t have time to grasp the magnitude. This year, with more time and intentionality, I feel pressure: to show up right for our organizing team, my community, and the global community, and to represent ourselves well. I’m the oldest or second oldest on this call, but the youngest in organizing. Every day, I’m learning how to show up with intention and authenticity. I hoped Palestine would be at least a little better by now. It’s 10 times worse. And once you peel back layers, you can’t unsee them. Days are tougher—and organizing becomes a second job. But to Nikkita’s point, the energy from artists, vendors, and community—people asking to be involved—has been real. Only recently did I feel the full magnitude of what this means to the community. That gives you your second, third, 10th wind when a small team is wearing a ton of hats. Knowing what this day will mean to everyone is what keeps me making calls, finishing docs, hopping on Zoom—grounded in why we’re doing it. This is the only group I could do this with—the one that teaches, gives grace and support, and helps us grow together. We’re seeing mobilizations globally and nationally—marches, strikes, flotillas, and more. How do you see this festival in conversation with those acts of solidarity? Oliver: Shout out to Gabriel and Maher for the lineup ideas—that’s where intentional solidarity shows up. Who we invited and why had everything to do with the messaging artists already live in their art and movement work. The lineup alone speaks to how we aim to operate in solidarity. Palestine is at the center of why we came together, but we’re also clear that we’re resisting larger structures. We want folks to leave with a deeper analysis of what we’re fighting and how. As an artist and cultural worker, I think about music, poetry, visual art—even the food we choose—as ways to bring us back to each other. Actions like the flotilla aim to break a siege, meet basic needs, and galvanize organized response to empire’s violence. The festival does parallel work: supporting HEAL [Palestine]’s care for children who’ve lost limbs; the Transgender Law Center’s protection of our trans siblings; La Resistencia’s frontline organizing at the Northwest Detention Center. These are tangible, often hyper-local ways to show up. Choosing beneficiaries like Water Protectors, the Black Panther Party, and BLM Washington reflects that our struggles are interconnected. Palestinians benefit from La Resistencia’s work; Black queer folks benefit from the Transgender Law Center and the Panthers. We’re showing up in multifaceted ways—care, organizing, resistance—and that starts on stage. No matter who you hear, you’ll get that message. Deepening our analysis deepens our resistance and commitment. I hope people leave with their cup filled and a fire to act. Peterson-Burge: I remind myself: Showing up in the streets is as important as showing up for cultural preservation, togetherness, breaking bread, teaching dances, eating the foods we’ve missed. All of it matters so we don’t lose ourselves while we fight for everyone. Creating space to preserve ourselves and our cultures is powerful, transformative, revolutionary—and necessary. Joudi: At the core, these movements are the same: people from all walks of life standing against oppression. Forty-plus countries supporting a flotilla is all of us understanding we must stand for all of us. That’s what we embody—through many avenues. Cultural preservation is huge. Speaking as a Palestinian, erasure includes stealing our culture—claiming hummus, rewriting our history. Supporting Palestinians isn’t only about Gaza and the West Bank—there’s immediate need, yes, but Palestine lives forever by preserving our culture. That’s true for every community represented here. Preserving who we are is how we win. For folks new to this movement or who didn’t attend last year, what do you want them to take away after attending? Joudi: For my community: the need for collectiveness. I’ve shouted for Palestine my whole life, and I “got” interconnectedness—Ferguson in 2016—but I hadn’t truly connected the dots on intersectionality and riding for each other. Our heroes have been telling us: Leila Khaled said 50 years ago there is only one oppression. The Panthers visited Philistine and stood with Palestine. Kids in Gaza held “I stand with Ferguson” signs. Our movements fall apart when we’re convinced to battle each other for attention. I want folks to understand it all needs to be discussed and fought for at the same time—it’s the same fucking move. The music, speakers, vendors are dope—we’ll feel good—but I need everyone to leave knowing we’re all connected against them. If you’re with them, you’re not with us. If you’re with us, you’re with all of us. Teodros: As a musician, I want artists to walk away less afraid and less alone in speaking up for Palestine. Somehow calling a genocide a genocide is still controversial. We intentionally booked people already making bold stands for humanity. I want that—and collective liberation—to become the norm. Culture helps by modeling it and building our own stages when others won’t book this—we have to do it ourselves. Also, let’s name it: Live Nation’s second-largest shareholder is BlackRock; Ticketmaster is part of that ecosystem—there are corporate interests in silencing artists. We can’t let them dictate culture. We do that—community, people, artists. Oliver: It would be easy to assume we had every resource from day one. We didn’t. We showed up finding resources as we went. You can have a big vision and then call your homies and make it happen—that’s how this happened. If we want more control, we have to build it. Our communities have long built institutions outside government—mutual aid networks, survival structures—out of brilliance and necessity. I hope folks leave thinking: We have the capacity to build our own structures for self-governance. Many hands make light work. And I hope the Black community sees our trans siblings as central to Black struggle; that we see immigrants’ fights against ICE and Indigenous fights for resources as ours too. There is no single-issue struggle. We can build what we need, together. Peterson-Burge: I want everyone to leave feeling, “I really needed that—and I got it.” To have been in space with our people and felt joy. And then I want folks to plug into an organizing home—consistently. If you don’t have one, find one: a book list, political education classes, places to learn our intertwined histories. I want cross-pollination—Palestinian homies connecting with the Black Panther Party; Black queer siblings pulling up with La Resistencia. Also, as a fundraising person, sustaining our movements means mobilizing the masses to support them. The festival is a vessel to move resources to under-resourced movements so our people can keep doing the work. If we can give a small grassroots org two more months of budget to keep stopping detentions, that matters. If five more people give $10 so they can buy water for volunteers, that matters. Our beneficiaries span different movement spheres to reach widely, rooted in intersectionality and collective struggle. I hope folks take action. Is there a moment from the past year of putting this together that represents the hope of what this festival means? Teodros: From an artist’s perspective: seeing artists meet through the festival and then collaborate. Even before the first one, watching Desirée Dawson—a Black woman in Canada—covering Samer, a young Palestinian artist’s, song, and sharing it online. Seeing Bambu and the Neighborhood Kids meet at the festival and then collaborate on music and a series of events. Maher was involved in events around the country with lineups that mirrored ours. Bringing folks together and watching them keep working—that’s meaningful. A post shared by Bambu DePistola (@bambudepistola) Joudi: Those moments were heartwarming. Where it really clicked for me—this isn’t just an event, it’s moving a movement forward—was in the last week or so. Vendors reaching out: “I missed the deadline, but I need to be there.” Artists asking to get on the lineup. Those are hard conversations—we want to keep it fresh and platform new voices—but the community’s feedback at every level has been powerful. Even on logistics calls—like with the video wall folks—people who weren’t involved last year were hyped because of the cause. Last year, stage staff told us how grateful they were to work the festival—we’re feeling that again. Stepping outside myself, I feel grateful and blessed to help make this happen, no matter how hard the work is, knowing what it means to people and what it will do for the community. Oliver: Two moments. First: Last year, a homie brought his elementary-aged son. I was stage-managing and saw them dancing together during Native Guns’ set. Afterward, he told me it was a transformative moment—passing down the cultural work of artists who politicized him, and watching his son be politicized by the same art, in joy. That’s joy as resistance—creating space to pass down resistance through art. Second: During Whodinii’s set, the Palestinian community—and comrades—broke into a big circle dance. Organizers and volunteers literally lost themselves in that moment, because they knew we built a space where we care for each other. You didn’t need your head on a swivel like at a protest. It was unbridled, embodied resistance. That’s what the festival is about—and the world I hope we get. Peterson-Burge: I was going to name that dance moment too—seeing Palestinians and other Arab folks teaching others how to do it was beautiful. Two other (selfish) moments for me: walking into the grounds that morning and seeing the banner and stage set with last year’s image—realizing, “We did that.” I had to walk off and cry. It represented weeks of late nights, fundraising, calls, crying, arguing—the whole thing—becoming real. Then at the end, bringing all the organizers onstage, arms around each other, taking a deep breath: “Dang, we did that.” Most of us didn’t know each other closely before last year—we put that first festival together in six to eight weeks. Now these people are my family. They’re coming to my wedding. That kind of relational, transformational organizing—where I can have hard conversations and be heard—was what I needed. It’s a huge reason I’m doing this again. If my people are doing something, I’m showing up—tired or not—because I know they’ll show up for me.

Title: Klarna CEOs $1 Billion Stock Pledge Pays Off With Surge In Wealth
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/klarna-ceos-1-billion-stock-pledge-pays-off-with-surge-in-wealth-11757705625684.html

Full Content:
Klarna Group Plc Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski didn’t sell any shares in his company’s blockbuster IPO this week — but he still managed to use the listing to consolidate his control over the company. Ahead of the offering, the 43-year-old founder pledged Klarna shares as collateral to secure a $112 million loan, according to a person familiar with the matter. The lender SEB AB provided the funding last month, with Siemiatkowski pledging a roughly $980 million stake in exchange as collateral, based on Klarna’s IPO price and regulatory filings. After securing the financing at a low loan-to-value ratio of 10%, he used the proceeds from the loan to buy out another investor in a special purpose vehicle that owns shares of Klarna, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing non-public information. While Siemiatkowski already controlled the special purpose vehicle, the deal allowed him to further increase his economic interest in the company, the person said. That bet is already paying off. Siemiatkowski’s Klarna stake has risen more than $65 million in value since the company began trading Wednesday, adding to the equity buffering his share pledge, according to Bloomberg calculations. He now holds a stake worth more than $1 billion even after Klarna’s shares fell 6.7% on Thursday, reversing part of an almost 15% surge the previous day. “I’m a big believer in the company,” Siemiatkowski said in an interview. “I’ve signed up for this long term.” A spokesperson for Klarna declined to comment on Siemiatkowski’s borrowing. Simmering Tension The size of Siemiatkowski’s stake in Klarna has long been a source of simmering tension inside the company. In the lead up to the IPO, he repeatedly clashed with his estranged co-founder Victor Jacobsson. Throughout 2024, the two argued over governance, including how the company would list and how much control Siemiatkowski would ultimately have in a publicly-traded Klarna. Just three weeks before Klarna first filed to go public in 2024, the firm’s shareholders voted to oust one of the company’s board members, Mikael Walther, after he challenged some governance decisions. Walther had long represented the interests of Jacobsson on the board. The SEB transaction offers a glimpse at how the rich can leverage their assets and the perks banks offer ultra-wealthy clients. While Siemiatkowski is doubling down on Klarna, pledging stock typically helps executives diversify their wealth and boost liquidity without selling part of their major assets. Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison has put up company shares to fund a lavish lifestyle that includes trophy properties, America’s Cup sailing teams and the Indian Wells tennis facility in California. Mat Ishbia, owner of the Phoenix Suns, pledged more than half of mortgage giant UWM Holdings Corp.’s outstanding stock in 2023 to secure loans before buying the NBA team for a then-record $4 billion. Lending against individual stocks or a portfolio of listed holdings is often easier and quicker for banks to process as the value of the collateral is more readily verifiable than less liquid assets such as real estate, art or superyachts. But it can also result in faster demands for extra collateral to cover borrowing costs if the pledge asset’s valuation declines. “Many years back, I sold some” Klarna stock, Siemiatkowski said. “So I can afford a nice house with my wife and we can go on some nice vacations.” Staying the Same After this week’s offering, Sequoia Capital is expected to have about 22% of the voting power, regulatory filings show. Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen’s Heartland A/S is set to have around 8.9%, Jacobsson would have around 8.8% of the votes and Siemiatkowski would have 7.4%. Klarna and its backers ultimately raised $1.37 billion in the listing this week, which saw surging investor demand. Povlsen, CEO of Danish clothing retailer Bestseller, was among the biggest winners from the IPO with his family office notching gains of more than 600% from its investment in Klarna almost a decade ago. He has a net worth of $6.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Siemiatkowski isn’t expecting much to change for Klarna as it begins life as a public company. The firm was already providing investors with quarterly updates on its results and it’s faced heavy regulatory scrutiny as its business has grown around the world. Founded in Stockholm, Klarna rose to prominence as a provider of so-called buy-now, pay-later financing, which grew in popularity during a pandemic-era boom in online shopping. More recently, though, the fintech has been making a push into offering other banking products like savings, checking accounts and credit cards. Speaking from his company’s offices in New York on Tuesday, Siemiatkowski was relaxed about the events ahead. While the IPO looked to be going well, the executive was more excited about a recent trip to Bentonville, Arkansas that he’d taken to visit the grave of Sam Walton, the founder of retail giant Walmart Inc. Klarna has been cozying up to Walmart this year after the retailer made the company’s fast-credit options available to its shoppers and a fintech backed by Walmart took a stake in Klarna. “Visiting the grave of Sam Walton and just reflecting on the fact that this kid from Sweden was just about to sign a deal with the largest retailer in the world,” Siemiatkowski recalled. “On an emotional level, unfortunately have to say that beats the IPO.” On Wednesday, Siemiatkowski live streamed his morning from the New York Stock Exchange using his Meta Platforms Inc. smart glasses, giving viewers a birds eye view as he rang the bell on the trading floor flanked by his top deputies and Michael Moritz, Klarna’s chairman. He was also donning a baseball cap with the words “The Last Blockbuster.” Blockbuster was once the largest video rental chain in the country. But as more consumers turned to streaming services in recent years, the company collapsed. There’s now just one Blockbuster left, located in Bend, Oregon. Siemiatkowski’s cap retails for $26 on that store’s website, which doesn’t take Klarna. With assistance from Pei Yi Mak. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: BlackRock’s Rick Rieder Climbs Ranks of Fed Chair Contenders

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Rieder is rising up the list of contenders to serve as the next chair of the Federal Reserve after Jerome Powell’s term expires in May, according to an administration official. In a wide-ranging interview that lasted for two hours on Friday in New York, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Rieder discussed monetary policy, the Fed’s organizational structure and regulatory policy, the person said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting. Bessent has so far interviewed four of the 11 candidates publicly named as under consideration for the top central bank job, the official said, emphasizing that the process is ongoing. One or two more names will likely be added to that list, according to the person. Rieder is one of the most senior executives at BlackRock, overseeing the firm’s fixed income business. He joined the company in 2009, following nearly two decades at Lehman Brothers Inc. A representative for BlackRock had no immediate comment. Bessent was impressed with Rieder’s long career in markets running large groups and his deep understanding of micro- and macro-contributors to the economy, according to someone familiar with the Treasury secretary’s thinking. Rieder would bring a calm demeanor and in-depth knowledge of financial firms outside the banking system if he becomes Fed chair, the person said. Bessent appreciates Rieder’s ability to use forward-looking frameworks to assess the economy, rather than relying on backward-looking data, the person said. The Treasury chief was impressed by a similar intuitiveness after a conversation with Fed Governor Christopher Waller over the summer. President Donald Trump has been frustrated with Powell’s dependence on data to guide the Fed’s next moves, giving him the nickname “Too Late.” Two senior staffers, one who is a macro-economist and another with regulatory and markets expertise, were in the room for Bessent’s meeting with Rieder. Trump last week said that his top candidates for Fed chair include Waller, former Fed official Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council. However, he has deputized Bessent to run a comprehensive search process. The Treasury chief has said that he will interview all the contenders and offer Trump a shortlist of three to four to consider later this fall. --With assistance from Silla Brush.

Title: NBCU's one-size-fits-all severance package for RTO workers shows just how much power employers have right now
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/workplace-severance-offer-rto-mandate-worker-loyalty-nbcu-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-12T17:56:56Z
Full Content:
The standard, tenure-based severance package is being put to the test. NBCUniversal is offering separation pay that isn't tied to employees' number of years on the job, an atypical move that some leadership experts say risks denting worker loyalty in the long term. The media giant told employees this week that if they don't want to comply with a new return-to-office mandate, they can leave and take a severance package comprising eight weeks of base salary, Business Insider first reported. The financial part of the arrangement is unusual, experts say, because severance packages are normally aligned with employees' length of service. An NBCU spokesperson previously declined to comment on internal communications and policies and didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. If other companies follow NBCU's example, workers may become less inclined to stay with any one employer for more than a few years, cautioned Raj Namboothiry, head of staffing firm Manpower's US division. That's because a potential future severance package would exclude the kind of safety net they could count on with a traditional package, he said. Since standard packages are tied to tenure, the longer an employee stays with a company, the bigger the payout they would receive. To be sure, NBCU is providing its eight-week pay-for-all packages on a voluntary basis. Companies including Amazon issued RTO mandates without granting any severance pay to workers who choose not to comply. Extending fixed payouts after more general layoffs would be dicier as far as loyalty goes, said Namboothiry, since workers would have no choice in the matter. These days, fixed severance packages after either layoffs or RTO mandates may not pose a problem for most leaders since job opportunities are scarce, said Nicole Kyle, cofounder of CMP Research, a research and advisory firm focused on the future of work. More people are currently unemployed and actively looking for work than there are job opportunities, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Employers have the leverage right now," Kyle said. But should the tables turn down the line, fixed packages may discourage people from seeking jobs at firms with a reputation for offering them in lieu of the standard tenure-based kind, Kyle added. "The labor market is going to remember," she said. There is some precedent to companies offering fixed payouts as part of voluntary separation agreements, but it is rare. In late 2021, online mortgage startup Better abruptly laid off about 900 employees and provided them with 60 days of severance pay, regardless of tenure. A more high-profile example occurred about five months after Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022. The billionaire sent the social-media company's employees an email instructing them to fill out a form asking if they wanted to remain at the company and be part of an "extremely hardcore" culture, Business Insider reported at the time. Employees who didn't opt to stay would be given three months of severance, Musk said in the email. Many Twitter employees took the deal. NBCU's package is available to US and UK staffers at the vice-president level and below. They must accept it by October 3 and stay through the end of 2025. By giving nearly four months' notice, NBCU is letting its work-from-home aficionados get a big jump-start on their job search in a tough market, said Anna Tavis, New York University's department chair of human capital management. While eight weeks of pay isn't a large sum for those at the VP level, Tavis said it could be an enticing offer for lower-level employees, which she believes may be NBCU's intention. It also might be more enticing for newer employees, said Kyle. Offering the same number of weeks' worth of severance pay for all departing staffers would likely appeal less to longterm employees who'd be eligible to receive far more money with a tenure-based package, she said. Employers looking to trim their workforces may be using return-to-office orders as an alternative to layoffs, expecting some employees to quit rather than comply, as Business Insider has reported. Tavis said that the approach is "less painful and more humane" than mass cuts. Still, the move poses risks, she added, as companies could see top talent walk out the door and land a job at a competitor that allows remote or more hybrid work. "You often first lose the people who have other options," Tavis said. Jump to

Title: BlackRock Weighs Tokenized ETFs Following Bitcoin Fund Surge

BlackRock is moving deeper into tokenized funds, and the moves are starting to look like a bid to bring traditional ETFs onto blockchains. Reports have disclosed that the firm’s tokenized money market product, known as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund or BUIDL, is already live on the Ethereum network and works with firms such as Securitize and BNY Mellon for transfer agent and custody roles. According to filings and industry reports, the BUIDL fund is backed by cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Transfer agent duties are being handled by Securitize while custody services are provided by BNY Mellon. Other infrastructure providers named in reports include Fireblocks, BitGo, Coinbase and Anchorage Digital. The fund pays yields to token holders on a daily basis using blockchain rails, and it is being positioned as a bridge between classic cash-like instruments and programmable token holdings. JUST IN: BlackRock plans to tokenize ETFs following success with $BTC fund. pic.twitter.com/yQD0E4VjpX — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) September 11, 2025 Executives have been quoted as saying tokenization could scale far beyond a single fund. Reports have put a potential addressable market figure as high as $10 trillion if a broad array of assets and ETFs are moved on-chain over time. Industry trackers also show that the total value locked in tokenized real-world assets passed $10 billion in recent months, a sign that the market is no longer purely experimental. BlackRock’s activity has prompted comparisons with other large asset managers, such as Franklin Templeton, which have also launched tokenized offerings. Proponents say tokenized ETFs could allow fractional ownership and round-the-clock transferability, and they could speed settlement in some cases. Reports say tokenization may also boost transparency since ownership records can be viewed directly on the chain. At the same time, uncertainty remains over how tokenized ETF shares will interact with existing market structures such as APs and market makers, and whether on-chain trading will be treated the same as exchange trading under US securities rules. Regulators, custodians and auditors face hard choices about legal rights, disclosure and investor protections for tokenized securities. On the basis of sector coverage, firms continue to sort out custody architectures and legal wrappers that provide enforceable claims on the underlying assets to token holders. Various jurisdictions might draw different conclusions, which would impede cross-border adoption or confine rollouts to individual markets. BlackRock’s investigation into tokenized ETFs is a follow-up on the success of its Bitcoin fund, already attracting robust inflows and market interest. The firm’s success in that department is now generating speculation that its next move will be to take pieces of its multi-trillion-dollar ETF business on-chain. Should the transition occur, it would represent one of the biggest steps so far by a global asset manager towards investment products based on blockchain.

Title: When You May Want To Add Guaranteed Income To Your Financial Picture
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cicelyjones/2025/09/12/when-you-may-want-to-add-guaranteed-income-to-your-financial-picture/

ByCicely Jones , Contributor. Due to many investors’ uncertainty about today’s market, I’ve seen many people opt to move entirely to cash and take investing off the table, but I’ve also had many investors approach me with questions about how to protect their investments and guarantee income. At the end of the day, the right investment for you entirely depends on your financial goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and alternative options you are considering. Here is information on how guaranteed income may fit into your financial picture. When investors are fearful, I often see them do one of a few things: If your asset allocation is well-diversified and consistent with your risk tolerance and you can remain disciplined, most of the best advice indicates that if you can stand it, to go with the first option. Moving toward cash and cash alternatives in the moment can feel satisfying in the moment but will ultimately diminish your purchasing power and reduce your lifetime income potential. Making speculative bets can easily result in losing your entire portfolio. I recently asked an investor how he landed on his investment portfolio because it did not appear to be following a cohesive strategy, and it was losing badly to every benchmark. He responded, “Youtubers and vibes.” While that has some entertainment value, I don’t recommend that sort of strategy for anyone who wants to reach a financial goal like retirement. There are several types of annuities and structured products, but I’d like to focus on indexed annuities and variable annuities because they can solve for longevity risk, inflation risk, volatility risk, interest rate risk, and taxation risk for the right investor. A variable annuity is a long-term financial product designed for retirement purposes. In essence, an annuity is a contractual agreement in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agree to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. Typically, variable annuities have mortality and expense charges, account fees, investment management fees and administration fees. In addition, annuity policies have exclusions and limitations, early withdrawals may be subject to surrender charges and, if taken prior to age 59 1/2, a 10% federal income tax penalty. Variable annuities are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of principal. An indexed annuity is a type of insurance contract that pays an interest rate based on the performance of a market index. It differs from a fixed annuity, which pays a fixed rate of interest, and a variable annuity, which bases its interest rate on a portfolio of investment options chosen by the annuity owner. Indexed annuities are sometimes referred to as equity-indexed or fixed-indexed annuities. One of the biggest questions when determining your retirement income need is how long you might live. According to Flowing Data, using information from the Social Security Administration, a female 40-year-old has: Essentially, the odds are highly in your favor of making it past age 80. This can present a problem when you try to make your money stretch potentially over 40 years. Because annuities are designed to pay out for someone’s entire life, regardless of what happens in the market, this can be particularly attractive to those with a family history of longevity. According to a 2024 BlackRock study, 97% of annuity owners say their annuities cause them decreased stress about running out of money. Over the last 100 years, inflation has averaged about 3% per year. That means that every year, to live the same lifestyle, your cost will go up. Let’s say your fixed expenses are $2,000 per month today. In 10 years, assuming 3% inflation, that monthly expense would be almost $2,700 per month. If you are considering sitting in cash, you will be losing purchasing power each year. While some annuities just pay a fixed amount every year, others can grow your payment amount each year through some combination of market returns or a guaranteed roll-up. When you are still in your accumulation phase without a thought of near-term withdrawals, you may be able to easily handle portfolio volatility. However, when you end up needing distributions, volatility can be a serious problem. Let’s go through two examples: Investor A has a portfolio value of $1,000,000 and an income need of $50,000 per year: Investor B has a portfolio value of $1,000,000 and an income need of $50,000 per year: Even though they started with the exact same amount, needed the exact same income, and had the exact same average return in two years, Investor B is in a significantly worse position because they started with a negative year instead of a positive one. If you take extend these small differences out 40 years, Investor B is more likely to run out of money than Investor A if they start in a worse market but ultimately achieve the same average return. Guaranteed income products attempt to eliminate that risk of timing issues leading to depletion of retirement savings. In retirement, I often see investors turning to money market funds, CDs, and fixed income investments. All of these are subject to interest rate risk. In the not-too-distant past, investors were getting between 0-2% on these types of investments, not even keeping up with inflation. Annuities are designed to provide some stability and predictability with guaranteed rates, making retirees less susceptible to interest rate risk. In nonretirement accounts, guaranteed income products offer tax-deferral during the accumulation phase. This means that unlike in brokerage accounts where you pay taxes every year on interest, dividends, and rebalancing, you will only pay taxes on the growth when you distribute funds. There is a good reason that annuities of the past have had negative associations. Not all guaranteed income products are created equal and it’s essential to speak with a qualified financial professional, about your goals and if a guaranteed income product is the right fit for a piece of your financial picture. In today's uncertain market, adding guaranteed income product offerings like annuities can address risks such as longevity, inflation, volatility, interest rates, and taxes. However, it's crucial to consult with a financial professional to ensure these products align with your unique goals and circumstances, enhancing your financial security and future planning.

Title: Nineteen Years of Shifting Goals

Time Published: 2025-09-12T16:15:51Z

It is time for 19! Number 19 – Corvette No, not that 19. The blog turns 19 today. Ever WP.com admits I have been around that long. The annual WP.com greeting And 19 years is kind of a long time, with nearly a third of my life involving me tapping out typo filled first drafts and pressing the publish button more than 7,500 times. But we’ll get to the silly stats a bit further down the page. And yet it feels a bit like a lesser turning of the years, just one shy of 20, a nice big round number that is so much more impressive than 19. 19 feels like it is almost there, while 20 has arrived. Or so it goes with those of us who count in base 10 I suppose. As part of Blaugust I reflected a bit on the writing process, as I am wont to do, but also considered the goals of the blog, what my writing assignment here is, was, and might end up being. I say that because I certainly didn’t start out the way things are now. It took a while to establish whatever we call what I am doing now. If we go back to that very first post back in September of 2006, I seemed to want to write about games I had already played, to go over my history. And I certainly did some of that. I wrote about early online games like Stellar Emperor and Air Warrior and TorilMUD. I tried to tease out memories of things like Starsiege: Tribes and the early days of EverQuest. You can find more than a few posts about games I played before I started blogging. But things quickly turned to talking about MMOs and what might come next. We were in both the age of blogging and of MMORPG popularity. We were going to have all sorts of MMOs, and they were going to be about anything and everything. Even Micheal Jackson. Planet Michael… only to be imaged, never to be seen And then the WoW killer… because surely somebody would come along and dethrone the mighty king of MMORPGs… never appeared. It captured and dominated the market and its peak was never eclipsed in the west and developers game up on that and started trying to cash in on the next trend, which was Facebook games or free to play MMOs or MOBAs or Kickstarted nostalgia farming name driven projects… all of which I covered some here and there. Almost all of them failed to live up to their promise and most failed to survive for very long. As part of that I started posting about events and launches and expansions and updates, if only just to establish a timeline so that I could remember what changed when. Along the way I wrote about what I was playing. At first those posts were haphazard, lacking in detail and mostly just “I did a thing” without much around it. That developed as a style, focused around the instance group and our adventures in Azeroth, but also around EVE Online and the ongoing struggle to find the game in the sandbox. That expanded to other games we played and got more detailed. Likewise, once I found my niche in null sec, posts about the ups and downs of space empires in New Eden began to figure much more. For no real reason beyond “it seemed like a good idea at the time” I wrote a Month in Review post at the end of that first September and have continued to do so every since. While those posts feature quite a bit of fluff, the revisiting of what I wrote about a year ago, five years ago, ten years ago, and so on… that became a cornerstone of my own experience with the blog, reminding me of the past and where I have been and what I have done online. In the end, it turned out the blog turned out to be about games I had played, my gaming history and such. I was just writing it as it went and it slowly became nearly two decades of history, and not all of it a complete waste. There is a whole page or so in Empires of EVE: Vol II that reprints my observations on the battle at 6VDT-H. My account, written the next day while the events of the battle were still fresh in my mind ended up being, ended up being able to provide some flavor of the battle in a book about the conflict of empires in which I was just one guy in a ship. And I still get a nod now and then for having written up something that didn’t make the news or other outlets. Recently I even got a nice message from Asher Elias, head of the Imperium, who is working on his own history of the game and null sec who said: your site has been so helpful it’s hard to overstate the value I feel pretty good about that. The blog, in the end, became something of what I intended, if not in exactly how I envisioned getting there. Though, again, that might apply more to EVE Online that other titles due to the nature of the game. The player driven nature of New Eden means that major events, battles and such, are one time unique events. Meanwhile, in WoW for example, every Deadmines run faces the exact same set of challenges, so the tale of our group is hardly unique save for the fact that we were there for that particular moment. What do I take from that? Don’t hesitate to write down some event? Maybe. Different from where I started for sure. And even these anniversary posts have evolved over time. As I always say, look at all the work I put into some of those early posts. They had themes! Now… well, go back and look at some of the old ones if you want fancy. Here they are: That is the preliminaries. Actually, I even gave you most of the reflections up front this time. Not sure what I’ll have at the back end. We shall see. The Basic Stats Days since launch: 6,940 (+376, because I had to calculate early last year) Posts total: 7,572 (+400) Total Words: 6,783,396 Average words per post: 895 (+58) Post Likes: 25,294 Average posts per day: 1.091 (-0.001… I am slowing… so very slowly) Comments: 40068 (+1,089) Average comments per post: 5.29 (-0.12) Average comments per day: 5.77 (-0.25) Comments written by me: 8,264 or 20.6% Space used by images: 4.7 GB used, 9.1 GB (70.2%) upload space remaining. Blog Subscribers: 3,523 (+975, mostly spammers) US Presidents since launch: 4 British Monarchs since launch: 2 Prime Ministers of Italy since launch: 9 Summary: I write a lot of words still and we have a retread president. Also, last year in my rush to get on a plane for our 25th wedding anniversary trip I totally didn’t update some of those numbers and I am too lazy to go re-figure the increment. But nobody commented on my, for example, saying I had surpassed the word count for the Wheel of Time series of books when the number I was showing was clearly less than that. But I am well past that now. Data Unfiltered So what is going on here at the blog? People still come to visit. Not as many as used to, but many more than I figured ever would. So let’s see what the numbers are, starting with page views. Year 19 – Page views by month If you add up the numbers along the right hand side it comes out to something like 6,863,443 page views over the life of the blog. That is more than I ever expected, though probably less than somebody like Amazon gets over the course of a minute on any given day. You can see the peaks and valleys of the site over the years. The high point was 2012, as I have oft indicated. Things really fell off after Covid, with 2021 and 2022 seeing the lowest numbers since the first year of the blog. Then things have revived a bit. Summed up by full year… so leaving out 2006 and 2025 so far… the trend looks like this. TAGN Page View Traffic by Full Years – 2007 through 2024 2007 remains the full year with the lowest count, but 2022 wasn’t that far behind. And then there is one more chart I usual toss in here. I usually just paste in an image of it, but I prefer actual numbers rather than pictures of numbers, so I am once again going to let WP format some data from Excel. So that is either a nicely formatted chart with numbers or a bunch of mushed up garbage, likely the latter if you’re reading this on your phone. Sorry about that. As you can see, until this year the number of words per post had been mostly rising. I don’t know what got into me in 2024, where I got close to 1,500 words per post, but this year I am down somewhat. Part of the rise in words has to be my month in review posts, which get a chunk longer every five years. But most of it is likely me taking care to fill in more details about things in posts as you never know what is going to end up being a critical or interesting tidbit of information years down the road. Who Sends People Here? Search engines. Seriously, that is most of the traffic. And Google is 98% of the search engine traffic. He is how search engines shake out. Google is on there three times… though Google Image Search isn’t the mighty referral engine it once was… because Google decided to just download all your images… excuse me, it cached them. On the bright side, Bing recognizes me again. It had de-indexed me for a stretch. On the flip side of that, does it matter? Also, hello my two AOL users, because I doubt the same AOL user landed here twice. Then there is social media and social media like sites… who no longer send me that much traffic anymore. At one time social media was a lot better at sending traffic out. But now sites like X go out of their way to keep people from leaving. Not that I post anything to X in any case, I deleted my account there more than a year back. New on the list, the AI sites are coming for us! Not really a force to be reckoned with at this point, but some of those sites only recently started trying to show their work. Then there are my fellow bloggers. They do send me a bit of traffic, more than some social media sites I post to daily. Here are the top ten blogs that send me traffic. Eight of those ten are Blogger based blogs that use the dynamic blogroll sidebar widget. Two of those eight aren’t even updated regularly, but still send me traffic due to that blogroll option. The Greybill is a fellow WP.com blog and just linked to me about a couple of EVE Online things, which I appreciate. And then there is I Has PC… or there isn’t I Has PC, as the site no longer responds. But is sent me a bit of traffic right up until the very end. More Frivolous Data We’ll start once again with the top ten categories of posts here, and the change since last year. Out of 104 total categories, a number unchanged since last year, these are, were, and remain, the most used. Null Sec, which is a sub-category, made it on to the list this year. Meanwhile, Sony Online Entertainment, a category that hasn’t been valid or used for the last decade, that finally fell off the top ten. Then there are tags, which represent the land of chaos. Tags I slap on a post at a whim, as a joke, as a futile attempt to signal tone or intention. And sometimes I use tags for games I am not sure quite deserve a category yet. No Man’s Sky is only a tag so far. So there are 5,065 tags used on the blog, up 287 from last year. For tags I feel like I have to do a top 20 just to get some scope. As always, the category often drives the tags used. If I write more EVE Online posts than anything else, then there are more EVE Online related tags. And, as I have done in the past, here are the tags I have used exactly 19 times over the last 19 years. It turns out there are ten of them. I actually know what all of those are related to. Last year I had a couple of “uh?” items on the list. What Do People Read Here? Here are the Top 20 most viewed posts over the last 12 months here on the site: That tells you what is popular, or at least what Google sends me. I seem to be answering some Pokemon Go questions for people, with five posts on the list. I am also interested to see how much No Man’s Sky traction I have gotten. As a game I haven’t elevated it to its own category yet because I have only written 16 posts with the associated tag, and a couple of those are month in review summaries. Maybe I should fix that. I gave Elite Dangerous a category slot and only used it four times. Certainly NMS has gotten more play time out of me. Also, I seem to have hit a nerve with my iTunes post. That was… last week, and it made the top 20 for the last 12 months? Then there is the ALL TIME TOP 20 posts list. First of all, I doubt I will ever have another post pass the 50K page view mark. The three that are up there are cemented by having been popular during the peak era of the blog. The average number of page views for the top 500 posts, which is all WP.com will let me see, is 1,457. The average for all 7,572 posts is probably double digits, even with Alamo and the Play On Guild Name Generator sitting above 60K. There are a lot of posts with 5 page views. There are also some classics in there. The EVE Online tutorial post, which was the fourth post on the site, and the first one addressing a game I was actively playing… well, it was a different time. No screen shots, just ire. I have suggested that it was my desire to rant about that tutorial that finally drove me to start a blog. Otherwise, that is a load of stuff that Google liked at one point or another. The Inevitable Summing Up Sometimes I arrive at this point in these annual posts and wonder aloud if I should take a break, not write so much, or change up what I write about. But if you’ve read down this far you’re not falling for that. I can’t even fool myself on that front anymore. Hell, last year I said I might not bother to do an annual review post, but here I am, Mister Unreliable Narrator. No matter how tired I am at the end of the day, I somehow always have something I want to post about. And it is even about video games most days! My goal, which I ended up setting a year or two in when I decided to reign in chaos and maybe have a plan, was to have a post on every week day, leaving aside weekends for overflow or non-gaming topics of whatever. I have somehow exceeded that plan… to the point that I have posted every day for the last 1,993 days in a row, or every day since March 29, 2020. Maybe I could give up on that streak… though, again, just seven more days for a round number. Really, though, I am wondering what I should do for the 20th next year. Open to ideas. Just 12 months to work that out. I started reading during the Casino War. The blog epitomized that Eve is a game I love reading about but never want to play. I stayed for the WoW and “history of Silicon Valley” content. Now you’re now a daily read for me. Congrats on 19 years! LikeLike Congratulations for the milestone. When it comes to the referral stats I’ve always wondered what it counts old school accessing via a favourite/ manually typing in the address – which is what I still mostly doing But yes, I can quite see your blog now being a resource for EVE history (and MMOs in general) quite similar to reviewing old newspapers. A contemporaneous record which reminds me, in a strange way, of some of the mediaeval annals I used to study at university. Which also used to have digressions onto this and that, just like your blog does. Anyways, hope you have a good twentieth year, and that these virtual worlds allow you to escape at least now and then from the “real” world, whatever the hell that is anymore. LikeLike Grats on another year. I do rememner when you were wondering out loud how much longer you’d go on. Glad to hear that’s stopped! Shame to hear I Has PC has folded. I thought I’d seen a couple of comments by Isey here and there, this year. I tried to look something up on Herding Cats the other day and Liore’s gone too. Confusingly, there is an unrelated blog called I Like Herding Cats… Still, I keep them all in that so-useful Blogger blogroll because if any of the dead ones ever sputter back into life, they pop up right back at the top and everyne knows about it. It’s like a public service now… LikeLike Well done. If in Australia your blog would be starting its second year of legally being able to drink alcohol. While I might go research something you have said – I don’t recall ever fact checking you, so I missed the wheel of time test. LikeLike Congrats! Has your blog signed up for Selective Service yet? LikeLike I had to look that up… and I guess it is still a thing. I did that 42 years ago. LikeLiked by 1 person My son had to do that when he turned 18, but my daughters are still exempt. I’m counting down the days until he turns 26 so he’s no longer eligible, but that also means he’ll no longer be on my insurance. LikeLike Proud to link to you from both my blogs! And I just wanted to say I also find your “posting to mark various events/milestones” useful, even as someone who doesn’t play EVE. There has been more than one occasion when I’d wonder about something like “didn’t I read about Everquest doing something like that once” and your blog is often a great place to verify random MMO trivia like that. I’ve also found your whole attitude towards blogging inspiring and am definitely emulating it a bit in the sense that I also post about many things with an eye to wanting to be able to have a reference point in the future.

Title: Tempus AI: Is TEM Stock A 10x Growth Story?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/tempus-ai-is-tem-stock-a-10x-growth-story/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T13:59:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Great news for Tempus AI stock! The company has just received FDA approval for an upgraded version of its Tempus Pixel platform — a cardiac imaging system that uses advanced AI to deliver highly accurate images of a patient’s heart. Remember when we talked about TEM last month and how it might double to $130? Well, it’s already climbed more than 33% in just a month. But here’s the surprising part: the opportunity for Tempus AI may not stop at a 2x return. It can potentially be a 10x story or more. Sounds too good to be true? It’s not—once you understand what Tempus AI actually does. Think of Tempus as the “Google of healthcare data.” The company has built the world’s largest library of clinical and molecular data and uses AI to turn this information into insights for precision medicine. While it started in oncology, it has since expanded into cardiology, radiology, and even mental health. Tempus doesn’t just gather data—it transforms it into real-time insights that help doctors make better treatment decisions. It’s like giving physicians a supercomputer that analyzes millions of patient cases to recommend the best care for each individual. Let’s talk numbers. Tempus has grown its revenue at an average rate of 50% over the past three years. In Q2 2025 alone, revenue grew 90% year-over-year, and the company raised its full-year outlook to $1.26 billion—over 80% growth from last year. Looking for more – revenue is expected to double over the next three years. The company is also nearing EBITDA profitability. This isn’t just growth—it’s accelerating growth with improving margins. Of course, these strong numbers come with the volatility typical of high-growth stocks. If you’re looking for upside with less risk than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with over 91% returns since inception. Also see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Tempus AI’s potential for explosive growth isn’t wishful thinking—it’s supported by solid fundamentals. Beyond profits, there’s a bigger reason Tempus AI must grow: healthcare justice. AI can help correct systemic disparities in care that affect underserved communities. Some populations face higher mortality from certain diseases due to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, creating major burdens. By using AI to tailor treatments and improve accuracy, Tempus can help close these gaps—making precision medicine accessible to everyone, not just patients at top hospitals. This mission will likely fuel broad social support. Let’s crunch the numbers. Tempus is projected to make about $1.26 billion this year. Imagine it scales revenue 15x. Of course, not overnight, think long term. With the AI healthcare market forecast to top $800 billion, can Tempus claim just 2.5% of that? It’s possible, especially if it captures more R&D spending from big pharma. For context, just five companies—Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Roche, AbbVie, and Eli Lilly—spent over $75 billion on R&D last year alone. If Tempus grows to $20 billion in revenue, it will likely become highly profitable. With medtech firms typically earning net margins of 22–25%, that implies about $5 billion in profit. At a median multiple of 35 times earnings, Tempus’s valuation would hit $175 billion—up from $15 billion today. This level of growth isn’t unprecedented. Look at Intuitive Surgical, which jumped 8x in value over the past decade—from $20 billion to $165 billion. The best part? We don’t think ISRG stock is done yet. Tempus AI may follow a similar trajectory. Despite its promise, Tempus faces major risks. Regulatory approvals for each AI tool are slow, and new data privacy laws may bring hefty fines. The company is also still unprofitable with high R&D spending, meaning it may need to raise more capital, diluting shareholders. Competition is intense—from giants like Roche and tech titans like Google with deep pockets. And its valuation is steep: a $15 billion market cap on $1.3 billion in 2025 revenue. Any stumble has the potential to send its stock plunging, making that 10x dream a long shot. Remember, single-stock investing always carries meaningful risk. Consider the Trefis High-Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which holds 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4 years. Why? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered stronger returns with lower volatility than the index, offering a smoother ride as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Overall, Tempus AI is a bold bet on the future of healthcare AI. The key question isn’t if it will succeed—it likely will. The real challenge is whether that success can deliver outsized returns from today’s lofty valuation. The next three to four years will be pivotal as it races to scale while the healthcare AI market matures and competition intensifies.

Title: Why Does David Ellison Want Paramount to Swallow Warner Bros. Discovery Whole? To Beat Rival Suitors to the Punch
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/paramount-warner-bros-discovery-acquisition-consolidation-analysis-1236515947/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T13:41:45Z
Full Content:
By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor David Ellison’s Skydance Media just completed the $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global five weeks ago. Now, before Ellison and his team have even finished the work of laying off upwards of 2,000 employees at the newly merged Paramount Skydance to slash costs, the son of tech multibillionaire Larry Ellison is mulling what would currently be a $70 billion-plus deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. The question is: Why now? Popular on Variety Related Stories TikTok to Launch In-App Movie Ticket Purchasing With Fandango, Starting With ‘Tron: Ares’ Jess Glynne, Jeezy, Black Eyed Peas Lead TikTok's Songs of the Summer 2025 Wouldn’t it make more sense to wait until WBD splits in half — to form Warner Bros. (HBO Max and studios) and Discovery Global (TV networks) — a transaction CEO David Zaslav says is on track to be done in April 2026? The WBD separation is designed to boost the value of its streaming and studios businesses by carving off the declining TV arm. Paramount Skydance could make a play for the standalone Warner Bros. without assuming the baggage (including the lion’s share of WBD debt) of the entity that will house CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery and other nets. And through a deal for standalone Warner Bros., Paramount Skydance would still get its hands on the key growth driver going forward: HBO Max. (The mind reels at what a fused HBO Max-Paramount+ might be rebranded.) One possibility is that a Larry Ellison-backed M&A play for WBD has been part of the Skydance strategy all along. The idea would be “to consolidate media assets during a period of industry-wide instability and build a conglomerate with a streaming-first focus wrapped with TV and film studios and potentially a larger linear television portfolio,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a research note Thursday. And the advantage of moving now is that it could “preempt a potential bidding war for only the Warner Bros. Streaming & Studios assets post-split,” Fishman noted. “By acting now, [Paramount Skydance] positions itself to secure the entire company before rivals can cherry-pick the most attractive assets.” Indeed, prior to news of Paramount Skydance’s prepping a bid for WBD, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, Wells Fargo media analyst Steven Cahall issued a note that pegged the future standalone Warner Bros. as “an attractive M&A candidate” — with Netflix “the most compelling buyer,” and other potential suitors including Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Sony and Paramount Skydance. Regarding the separated Warner Bros. streaming and studios biz, Cahall wrote, “This will be the only large IP asset for sale at a time when most studios/streamers have big aspirations.” The analyst acknowledged that Netflix has not historically made any big M&A deals. But he opined a Netflix takeover of Warner Bros. had a number of benefits, including being able to “kickstart” a theatrical strategy for the streamer, help it scale video games and “most importantly [provide] premium content to members.” Cahall calculated the value of standalone Warner Bros. at around $65 billion. To be sure, any Paramount Skydance offer for Warner Bros. Discovery would face big financial and regulatory obstacles — arguably much greater than those that arose with the Skydance-Paramount merger. After Warner Bros. Discovery shares zoomed up 29% on the potential Paramount bid, WBD now has a market value of $40 billion. When adding in debt (minus cash and equivalents), the enterprise value of Warner Bros. Discovery is now about $71 billion. And that is a far bigger price than the Ellisons paid to swing Skydance-Paramount. “We think the high debt leverage of WBD is an impediment to a high bid for WBD’s shares,” Kenneth Leon, director of industry and equity research at CFRA Research, said in a Sept. 11 note. He suggested that, even if Paramount Skydance wins a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole, it may “be only interested in the businesses that will become Warner Bros. and not see meaningful value creation from the Discovery Global media portfolio.” But MoffettNathanson’s Fishman speculated that Paramount Skydance could see big benefits by pooling its TV business with WBD’s. “Overall, we would expect material cost synergies from the overlapping cable networks,” he wrote — i.e., layoffs. Fishman added that there are “presumably a high level of synergies from combining CBS News with CNN plus the long-term existing partnership between CBS and Turner with the NCAA’s March Madness Final Four.” Then there’s the question of whether a Paramount-WBD tie-up could get regulatory approval, as it represents a more horizontal combination of two media giants than Skydance-Paramount. Skydance was largely a production company, with limited overlap with Paramount Global. Already coming out against the notion of a combined Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who wrote in a post on X Thursday that such a media merger “must be blocked as a dangerous concentration of power.” The Trump administration OK’d the Skydance-Paramount merger, after Skydance made key concessions to the FCC including hiring a CBS News ombudsman to vet complaints of “bias” and promising to never bring back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at the company. But Warren and others have alleged Paramount Global’s $16 million payment to Trump to settle his lawsuit (alleging CBS News’ “60 Minutes” deceptively edited an interview with then-VP Kamala Harris) was a “bribe” to get Trump’s blessing on their deal while Warren also called out Trump’s claim that the new owners of Paramount promised $20 million worth of free advertising. “Remember when Trump announced a multimillion-dollar secret deal with CEO David Ellison? And then — shocker — Trump approved Ellison buying CBS/Paramount,” Warren wrote in the post. “Now, Ellison wants to take over CNN/Warner Bros.” (Skydance and Paramount said they complied with all U.S. laws throughout the merger process, including antibribery laws.) Whatever scenario ultimately unfolds, Zaslav for one seemingly will see his wish for media biz consolidation realized. After Trump was elected to a second term in November 2024, Zaslav expressed optimism the new administration would facilitate industry M&A. Trump 2.0, Zaslav said, “may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different” and that it may “provide a real positive and accelerated impact on this industry that’s needed.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Why a Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery Merger Makes Sense | Analysis

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The ink is barely dry on the $8 billion Skydance merger and the Ellisons may already be eyeing their next target Fresh off its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount appears ready to pounce on Warner Bros. Discovery in a bid to merge its way to becoming a next-generation media giant. Paramount’s new CEO David Ellison is reportedly preparing a majority cash bid for all of WBD’s assets, including its cable networks and movie studio. According to the Wall Street Journal, it would be backed by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison — David’s father and newly-crowned as the world’s richest man. Warner stock closed up nearly 30% at the end of Thursday’s trading session, while Paramount was up more than 5%, with both companies hitting new 52-week highs of $17.24 and $87.89 per share, respectively. Representatives for Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment. A potential deal would give the diminished Paramount and Warner Discovery much-needed scale and an increased arsenal of content at a time where they’ve lagged behind Netflix and Disney in the streaming wars. Combined the new company would have a total of 203.4 million streaming subscribers as of the latest figures from the second quarter of 2025 — putting it just shy of Disney’s 207.4 million across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ in its latest quarter. Reaching numbers to be competitive with Disney and Netflix has been a long-stated aim of Warner Discovery CEO David Zaslav. Paramount would also be able to tap Warner’s massive portfolio of assets, including Warner Bros. Television and Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max, Discovery+, a slew of cable networks and other media businesses, including production studios in Burbank, California, and Leavesden, England. They would be paired with Paramount assets including the CBS network, Paramount Pictures and its studio, along with streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto TV and cable networks like Comedy Central, MTV, BET and Nickelodeon. Additionally, the companies would have stronger bargaining power with advertisers, distributors and talent and the opportunity to generate massive cost savings. Paramount has already identified more than $2 billion in merger-related cuts that will be carried out through layoffs, a review of its real estate portfolio and a transformation of its technological infrastructure. Wolfe Research’s Peter Supino estimates that a combined Paramount-WBD could generate $3 billion in cost synergies, including roughly $1.5 billion from streaming & studios, $1.2 billion from Warner Bros. corporate costs and roughly $250 million from linear networks. “It’s a brilliant move,” Lloyd Greif, president and CEO of the Los Angeles-based investment firm Greif & Co., told TheWrap. “Everybody knows Larry Ellison has the ability to pull it off. So let there be no doubt, this is a doable deal, even though Paramount is a minnow and Warner is a whale. I don’t think anybody on the street has any doubts that they can complete this transaction.” Merging the two media companies together would catapult David Ellison further into the upper strata of power players in the entertainment world, one he had just entered through Skydance’s merger with Paramount. It would also expand the influence of the Ellison family in the media and tech space. In addition to WBD, the younger Ellison has been circling Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. President Donald Trump has also previously expressed support for the elder Ellison’s Oracle to buy TikTok. “For the Ellisons, pulling this off would crown their effort to build a next-gen Hollywood major,” Qualia Legacy Advisors managing director Aaron Meyerson said. “For David Zaslav, it could provide a strategic exit after years of cost-cutting and debt management.” That said, Hollywood insiders bemoaned the prospect of losing yet another major studio. “You have 20 percent fewer people to sell to. Finding the next Jordan Peele, the next Daniels [Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert] — the threshold gets harder and harder,” said one top executive from a rival studio. “And does it become a free for all? Does Apple try to buy Universal?” the executive continued, suggesting that the sparse details from Thursday’s leak suggests a trial balloon rather than a serious bid. “If I were looking to do R&D and test the market, today was very successful,” this person said. Even if a deal goes through, Howard Homonoff, a strategic advisor to media and tech companies and managing director of Homonoff Media Group, told TheWrap that many important strategic questions remain unanswered. For one, the combined company could be exposed to too many cable networks at a time when that business is in decline. It’s also unclear if combining Paramount+ and HBO Max would be enough to close the gap with streaming heavy-hitter Netflix. “It’s a bigger player, but it still leaves a lot of questions for future investors about what the growth strategy is,” Homonoff said. Still, the chance to increase the reach and scale of the companies may be worth the risk. Ellison’s move comes as the Zaslav-led media giant has been working towards a split of its linear network (Discovery Global) and studios and streaming businesses (Warner Bros.) by mid-2026. MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman said that getting a bid early could preempt a potential bidding war for WBD’s streaming and studio assets post-split. “By acting now, Paramount positions itself to secure the entire company before rivals can cherry-pick the most attractive assets,” Fishman wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. “Perhaps just as important, the odds of the deal clearing regulatory review may be higher for the Skydance team given its recent success in closing the Paramount transaction.” Among the potential rival bidders that Fishman floated include Comcast, which is currently in the process of its own spin off of network assets with Versant, and Apollo Global Management and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which previously kicked the tires on Paramount prior to Ellison’s acquisition. Representatives for Comcast, Apollo and Sony did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Greif also didn’t rule out the possibility of a big tech player like Apple, Amazon, Google or other private equity firms entering the ring. “Warner Brothers is an extremely attractive asset. I think everybody pays attention to this one and doesn’t let it go,” Greif said. “Splitting would have definitely attracted a feeding frenzy. This move is trying to catch everybody flat footed, but you can’t really catch anybody flat footed for long. They’re all going to think long and hard about getting into a bidding war with Larry Ellison.” While a deal is doable, there will obviously be key challenges for Ellison to overcome if he ultimately makes a bid. Among the challenges are WBD’s massive $35.6 billion in gross debt to pay down on top of Paramount’s own $15.5 billion. Experts also aren’t ruling out potential antitrust, regulatory or political scrutiny from the Trump administration and other lawmakers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already knocked a potential tie-up as a “dangerous concentration of power” and warned it “must be blocked.” “Regulators would scrutinize overlaps in broadcast (CBS), cable news (CNN), sports rights and streaming under the (Department of Justice)’s tougher merger guidelines and to a lesser extent the FCC,” Meyerson said. “It’s a bold swing with real industrial logic, but the political and financial execution risks are equally large.” Any deal, however, would likely be supported by the deep-pockets of the elder Ellison, whose net worth sits at $367.2 billion. And given Paramount’s $7.7 billion bid to acquire the rights to UFC, the Ellisons have shown they’re willing to spare no expense if it gives them a competitive advantage. On the regulatory front, the Ellisons have already done a lot of work to gain favor with Trump, who could ease any regulatory concerns. There’s also the question of whether Zaslav is ready to hand over the reins or not, though this isn’t the first time a merger with Paramount has been mulled. Ultimately, if the offer is rich enough, it may not be up to him. “There will be pressure on him to act in the interest of the shareholders,” Greif said. “If the deal is deemed to be an attractive price, it’s a deal that gets done whether Zaslav has a position post-closing, or whether he just smiles all the way into happy temporary retirement. And it would be temporary retirement. Guys like that don’t stay on the sidelines for long.” Sharon Waxman contributed reporting to this story.

Title: OpenAI's Nonprofit Parent to Own More Than $100B Stake in ChatGPT Maker

OpenAI said its nonprofit parent will have an equity stake exceeding $100 billion in the ChatGPT maker, making it "one of the most well-resourced philanthropic organizations in the world." OpenAI, which said the "recapitalization would also enable us to raise the capital required to accomplish our mission," also said it and backer Microsoft (MSFT) had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to extend their partnership, and were "actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement." OpenAI had initially announced plans last year to transform into a for-profit company, a condition for money it raised in funding rounds, including one where it raised $6.6 billion from investors including Microsoft and AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA). Becoming a for-profit company would allow OpenAI to make financial returns for its shareholders and also go public, marking a departure from its original mission of building open-source technology that wouldn't be subject to commercial priorities. Separately, Microsoft avoided a potentially massive antitrust fine from the European Union by striking a deal to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its popular office apps. The European Commission, the EU's enforcement arm, said it has accepted the moves by Microsoft to untie Teams from its productivity applications Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, included in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites for business customers. Microsft will now make these apps available to consumers without Teams at a lower price, allow customers tied to longer licenses to switch and let customers move their data out of Teams to use competitors. Microsoft shares, which entered Friday up by almost a fifth this year, are rising 1.4% in premarket trading.

Title: What’s Happening With Adobe Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/whats-happening-with-adobe-stock/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe stock (NASDAQ: ADBE) is seeing some gains after it recently reported strong quarterly results and provided an optimistic outlook, which was a bit of a surprise. Why do we say it's surprising? Well, in the past, Adobe's stock has actually dropped the day after its earnings reports 75% of the time. So, the big question is, should you buy ADBE stock right now at around $360? We believe the answer is yes. Adobe has been a bit of an underperformer this year, down about 20% while the S&P 500 is up 12%. Part of this is due to its slower-than-expected growth in the AI space. This past quarter, the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) from AI-influenced products reached over $5 billion, which is an increase from the $3.5 billion at the end of fiscal year 2024. To be frank, a $5 billion figure might seem small for a company of Adobe's size, especially when other tech giants like Google and OpenAI are generating much more from the AI boom. However, the market is smart and has likely already taken this slower AI growth into account. At its current price of $360, ADBE stock is trading at 18 times its trailing adjusted earnings. That's half of its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36. This means that from a valuation standpoint, ADBE looks very attractive. Beyond the valuation, our analysis of Adobe’s performance across key areas like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operational and financial foundation. We'll delve into these factors in the sections below. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, ADBE stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market. Adobe's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. Adobe's profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Adobe's balance sheet looks very strong. ADBE stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on ADBE stock? Our dashboard Will You Be Comfortable Buying Adobe Stock? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. In summary, Adobe's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Despite being more expensive than the benchmark index, Adobe's valuation has become much more attractive recently. Given the company's strong performance in the above parameters and attractive valuation, we believe ADBE stock is a good buy right now. Of course, we could be wrong, and investors may not be willing to pay a premium for the stock due to its slower-than-expected AI growth. However, if you have a 3-5 year investment horizon, our conclusion is that ADBE is a good stock to own at current levels. While ADBE stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Posted on September 12, 2025 by Nick Roach 1 Comment The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available for use on new websites. If you use Divi 5, you’ll notice an update notification for Public Alpha Version 23. We release new Divi 5 versions every two weeks, and it gets better each time. If you haven’t tested Divi 5 yet, try it and let us know what you think. I didn’t post an update for Public Alpha 22, so this post will cover everything new in Public Alpha 22 and Public Alpha 23. Since Public Alpha 21, we implemented 247 bug fixes and improvements and released two new features, including the new Responsive Editor and Custom Attributes. You’ll notice the bug fixing has ramped up significantly as we near the beta launch, and the team has transitioned away from feature development. Even though the development team is focused on fixing bugs and prepping for the beta launch, I found time to squeeze in a couple of surprise features. Custom Attributes were released in Divi 5 Public Alpha 23. 🎉 This new feature allows you to add any attribute, such as alt, title, rel, and aria-label, to elements and most sub-elements. Divi has had support for specific attributes, such as class and ID, but now you can add any attribute to any element. This is especially important for accessibility, allowing you to, for example, add alt text to images, and roles and labels to non-semantic elements like an icon-based button. The new Responsive Editor was released in Divi 5 Public Alpha 22. 🎉 This editor lets you quickly view, modify, and reset the responsive, hover, and sticky states for any setting while in any view mode. In Divi 5, you get the best of both worlds: natural, intuitive editing, where all changes made while in a particular view mode apply automatically, and the new responsive editor, which allows you to make swift changes to all states at any time. Here is a list of all the changes implemented since Public Alpha 21. It’s important to note that Divi 5 is production-ready for use on new websites today! Due to the scope of the Divi 5 project, we took a non-traditional approach to its release schedule, releasing it in five phases. The ultimate goal is to make Divi 5 as helpful as possible, as soon as possible, to as many people as possible. We are in the Alpha phase, akin to “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features, but what’s done is ready to be used. It’s far superior to Divi 4 in almost every way. If you prefer Divi 5, you can use it to build new websites. We aim to enter beta in ~1 month. Almost the entire team is focused on cleaning up the remaining bugs, and we’ll launch the beta as soon as we are confident that we have cleaned up the worst of them. The date we launch the beat will depend on the volume of new bugs reported over the next few weeks. Divi 5 will reach its “final form” before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of leapfrogging the competition before the year ends. Part of that goal involves aggressively developing new features as part of the feature swap. But don’t forget! Between now and then, you can use Divi 5 whenever it becomes your preferred experience. Instead of rushing to a final release, we’re maintaining both Divi 4 and Divi 5, giving users a choice. Once we’re confident in removing that choice, we’ll make it official, and everyone will get the Divi 5 upgrade notification. The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available today. Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you find a bug, report it to our team, and we’ll fix it. We’ll continue to work aggressively to add new features and address feedback.

Title: The new frontier: Meet the power players cashing in on the AI gold rush

As hundreds of billions pour into data center development, these are the names making a killing from AI investments. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If there is one unifying theme across the entire AI industry over the past year, it has been staggering, unprecedented investment. Hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into companies the world over, promising enormous innovation and profit-making opportunities in equal measure. Governments and private enterprises have scrambled to keep pace with its rapid evolution, and even if the biggest companies haven't managed to make a profit just yet, that's not stopping the investor dollars from flowing in. That's largely to the benefit of the companies receiving that level of interest and backing, but most of those companies are headed by individuals with large stakes in them. As those investments were announced and company stock prices ballooned in response, so did the personal fortunes of CEOs, founders, and investors, to truly eye-watering levels. Oracle's Larry Ellison "made" over $100 billion in a single day when it was announced his company had struck a $300 billion infrastructure deal with OpenAI over five years, catapulting him into position as the world's richest person overnight. He's far from an isolated example. We've collated a list of notable names who have been the biggest benefactors in the ongoing AI boom. Jensen Huang founded Nvidia in a Denny's in 1993 and, until the mid-2010s, was primarily known within the relatively niche world of PC gaming enthusiasts. However, in the latter years of the decade, he was tipped by Fortune to power the AI revolution, and from the back of that, his personal wealth exploded. By 2019, he was worth $3 billion, ballooning to $100 billion by mid-2024, and reaching a peak of $243 billion in August 2025, before falling to around $157 billion at the time of writing. This tracks almost exclusively with the Nvidia share price. Huang maintains around 3.8% of the company and remains its largest shareholder. Huang is one of the many AI CEOs spearheading the enormous global investment in AI, promising to help build as much as $500 billion in "AI factory" data centers in the U.S. alone by 2029. Even if he doesn't quite hit that milestone, though, Nvidia GPUs are the fastest and most capable for AI training and inference, and that sees no sign of slowing. As the head of the world's most valuable company at the forefront of the hottest investment industry in the world, it would be no surprise to see Huang's personal wealth continue to grow in the years to come. Huang has maneuvered Nvidia into a keystone position in this burgeoning industry. While the likes of Meta used to train its AI on internally developed hardware, today, they use Nvidia GPUs. As does xAI, and OpenAI. Even though Chinese developers can't get the best Nvidia GPUs, they've still bought up H20s in the hundreds of thousands. The plan moving forward is to continue the upsell. Nvidia recently announced its Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU platform, which is multiple times faster for AI inference workloads than older Hopper-based designs, and allegedly up to 45% faster running DeepSeek than even existing Blackwell GPUs, like the GB200. Huang is taking the yearly upgrade model that turned Nvidia into a leading gaming business, and applying it to AI and data centers. He's encouraging the building of "AI factories," which are described like money printers: GPUs and electricity go in one end, and money comes out the other. Nvidia wants to sell the world on the "economics of inference," and it wants to sell them the hardware to help them benefit. The new richest man in the world, Larry Ellison is worth $383 billion at the time of writing. He founded the company that would become Oracle in 1977, and remained its CEO until mid-2014, though he retains roles as the CTO and executive chairman. He has a range of business investments that make up his expansive portfolio, including 10s of millions of Tesla shares, and a commanding stake in Paramount Skydance. But it's his 40% stake in Oracle that has seen his net worth expand so rapidly in recent years. In 2020, he was worth around $67 billion, but by 2025, when Oracle was announced as a partner in the massive Stargate project, his net worth began to skyrocket. By mid-2025, it was over $200 billion, and following the announcement of another $300 billion partnership with OpenAI, he became the world's richest man; at least, temporarily. Staying there may depend on the real-world feasibility of the deal. Although Oracle is a company worth in excess of $600 billion, it holds a lot of debt, and will reportedly need to take on a lot more of it to secure the hardware and build the infrastructure it will need to supply OpenAI in the first place. On top of that, OpenAI will have to figure out how to pay for it. With its revenue for 2025 predicted to be between $15 and $20 billion, and none of it profit, it doesn't even generate enough to pay for a portion of a single year of this deal. And still, it's been struck and confident plans made for its commencement in 2027. Oracle has announced its intention to build data center facilities in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Texas, Michigan, and New Mexico with partner firm Crusoe. With much of Oracle and Ellison's value now resting on the projected annual revenue from this OpenAI deal, both companies will need to follow through to keep Oracle riding high. The youngest member of this list, Alexandr Wang is the current chief AI officer at Meta, a role he received after Mark Zuckerberg invested over $14 billion in his company, Scale AI, pushing his personal net worth up to $3.2 billion. He founded Scale AI in 2016, aged just 19, as a data labeling and model evaluation service. Within five years, the company was worth over $7 billion, and Wang's personal net worth reached a billion for the first time. Wang is estimated to maintain a 5% stake in Scale AI, though the company is not publicly traded, so it's unknown how much any such stake would be worth. Wang is now a prominent figure within Meta and is effectively the head of its AI developments, though presumably with some deference to Mark Zuckerberg. He'll be looking to spearhead Meta's plans for AI superintelligence. Although it doesn't have a definitive definition, it's a lofty goal the company is targeting in an effort to leapfrog the immediate efforts of its contemporaries. Scale AI will run in his absence, but it seems likely to slowly pivot to more government and militaristic roles in the years to come. Wang has been a consistent presence within the tech circles of the Trump administration, and Scale AI has signed deals in 2025 with the United States Department of Defence to use AI to plan ship movements and with the Qatari government to use AI tools in predictive analytics. A fixture on billionaire lists of all kinds for the best part of 20 years, Mark Zuckerberg pivoted from hyping the metaverse to pushing the AI future after the success of ChatGPT in 2022/2023 - although Meta AI has been a branch of Meta since 2013 (then called Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research). Although Meta has largely garnered AI-related headlines for its spending habits more than its products, it's still a major player in the AI space, and Zuckerberg has pushed artificial intelligence development as one of the core products of his company moving forward. Much like the Metaverse was before it. Perhaps that's why Zuckerberg's personal wealth hasn't ballooned quite like some of the others on this list, but he still has one of the largest single-day value pops on his resumé. In July 2025, his net worth leapt over $28 billion in a single day after the Meta stock jumped following strong revenue reports. However, at the time, investors were seemingly excited by the potential of Meta's AI investments, which had been aggressive, especially with regard to bringing in talent like Alexandr Wang. Zuckerberg has set his AI sights higher than most, though. Where OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic are mostly focused on developing functional AI tools today, Meta isn't competing directly and is instead said to be focusing its research efforts on developing "super intelligence." This would be an AI model with greater than human-level intelligence. It would need to be more functional and capable than even general intelligence AI, or AGI, which is seen as the goal of many AI research and development projects. But since no one has clearly defined that, or shown any sign we're close to such a breakthrough, the idea of doing something much more capable than that in the near term is hard to imagine. Elon Musk is a divisive figure with fingers in many pies. While most of his wealth derives from shares in Tesla and SpaceX, he is also a majority shareholder in xAI, which produces the Grok artificial intelligence most commonly used on Twitter/X. When Musk used xAI to purchase X Corp (X's parent company) in March 2025, it valued the combined holdings of the two companies at $80 billion. He's since gone on to announce he's buying an entire power plant to run AI inference, and hopes to buy 50 million Nvidia GPUs. The xAI valuation contributes mightily to Musk's total net worth of around $400 billion, depending on market fluctuations (at the time of writing, Larry Ellison and he are bouncing back and forth for the top spot). This is close to double his net worth from 2022, but while his AI endeavours have contributed to that, it's the Tesla share price that has been the main driver of his wealth generation. What's next for Musk and his AI efforts is hard to pin down. He's always talked a big game about his companies and services, whether it's promising self-driving cars within two years over a decade ago, or reaching Mars before 2030. His latest claims are that AI will be smarter than a human by 2026 and smarter than the combined intelligence of all humans by 2030. He wasn't clear whether Grok would be the AI to make that achievement. More recently, Grok has been embroiled in scandals where it praised Hitler and allows users to create sexually-explicit deepfakes of celebrities. Even if superintelligence is possible with large language models, there's still a lot of work to do before we get there with the current crop of options. Many figures on this list, such as Musk, Alexandr Wang, Zuckerberg, and more, are all embroiled in a race to develop the most cutting-edge AI models possible. However, Jensen Huang's Nvidia is selling the most powerful chips to power it all. The outlook remains fierce, and with investors still clearly interested in the potential of AI, there could still be billions more to be made for the top names at all of these companies. As the AI race marches on and deals are being struck to democratize AI usage among people and populations, it's clear that the genie won't be going back in the bottle any time soon, even if OpenAI's Sam Altman admits that investors remain "overexcited" about AI.

Title: Target Stock To $45?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/target-stock-to-45/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T11:00:20Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Target (NYSE: TGT) has already decreased approximately 40% over the past year. This decline is painful, yet not entirely unexpected. Earnings growth has stagnated, competition is increasing, and the company is getting ready for a change in leadership. Q2 2025 brought a slight earnings beat, but the broader scenario remains one of sluggish sales and shrinking margins. Why is Another 50% Drop Possible? Target's performance during downturns should raise concerns for investors. The stock declined by 60.6% in the inflation shock from 2021 to 2023, while the S&P 500 experienced a 25.4% drop. It decreased 29% during Covid, slightly outperforming the market, but in the financial crisis, it fell 63.8% compared to 56.8% for the S&P. In summary, Target has a history of underperforming when consumer spending tightens. The stock has dropped over 10% in the past month. Could it decline further? Yes. From our perspective, three factors could converge to push shares down to $45—a decrease of about 50% from current levels: revenues, margins, and valuation. Target does have the potential for recovery, but its past performance, current fundamentals, and relative positioning indicate that the downside scenario should be taken seriously. However, investing in a single stock carries significant risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio is designed to mitigate stock-specific risks while providing exposure to upside potential. Additionally, see What’s Next For ANF Stock? Target's sales have been declining. Over the last three years, revenue has fallen at an average rate of 0.3%. FY 2024 reported $106 billion, a 0.7% decrease from the previous year. The latest quarter recorded another 0.8% decline. For further information, see: TGT Revenue Comparison Why? Discretionary demand remains low. Inflation has nudged shoppers towards value, benefiting Walmart (NYSE: WMT) for groceries and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) for bulk buys. Target's reliance on apparel, home goods, and electronics—categories currently under strain—has worsened the situation. Inventory misjudgments in 2022 led to heavy markdowns that hurt both sales momentum and profitability. Digital growth, which was once a strength, has decelerated since the pandemic. The upcoming CEO shift in FY2026 brings execution risk. The planned conclusion of the Ulta partnership removes a source of traffic in beauty. Meanwhile, Walmart and Costco continue to gain shares in groceries and traffic, leaving Target squeezed in the mid-market. Collectively, these pressures impact comparable store sales, brand relevance, and digital uptake—key factors for long-term growth expectations. Profitability is also declining. The operating margin averaged 5.4% over the last year, with free cash flow margin at 6.2% and net margin at 4.0%. These figures lag behind broader retail benchmarks. Why? A shift in sales mix towards lower-margin essentials, ongoing cost inflation, and continued shrinkage have all contributed. To maintain traffic, Target has relied on promotions, which have diminished pricing power. The gross margin was 29% in Q2, down from 30% the previous year. A retreat toward pandemic lows of 25–26% would reduce operating income by roughly 40%. At today’s price of $92 per share, Target is exposed to substantial downside risk if its fundamentals weaken. Suppose revenues contract by approximately 2% annually through 2026, discretionary spending continues to be subdued, and gross margins revert to 25–26% (from 29%) due to markdowns, wage inflation, and shrinkage. In that scenario, operating income could decline by roughly 40% compared to FY2024 levels. Net income may reduce from $4 billion ($8.86 per share) in 2024 to about $2.2 billion ($5 per share) in 2026—representing a 45% decrease. Markets seldom reward declining earnings. If sentiment deteriorates and investors reassess Target’s valuation closer to struggling department stores at 8x earnings—down from the current 11x multiple—the implied equity value would be around $45 per share. This reflects about a 50% downside from current levels. Timing remains uncertain. This scenario could develop over two years or four—but the risk is tangible if sales and margins continue to erode while competitors strengthen their positions. The forthcoming third-quarter results will serve as an early indicator: any stabilization in comparable store sales or gross margin might alleviate some pressure, but if weaknesses continue, investor skepticism is likely to rise. Progress may require time, but maintaining patience should yield results. Target’s advantage lies in its affordable, style-centric private labels. By enhancing these through improved merchandising and digital execution, the company has a clear pathway to success. Our analysis suggests that a favorable outcome is probable, although it may necessitate that both investors and customers adopt a long-term perspective. You might consider exploring the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate solid returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to maximize gains during favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), a quantum computing company, has taken a major leap by figuring out how to mass-produce high-quality synthetic diamond films. Think of it this way: they can now bond these specialized diamonds onto standard computer chips—a potential game-changer for building quantum computers. Developed with Element Six, this breakthrough enables the company to manufacture these components at scale. It’s a core element of IonQ’s plan to reach a 2-million-qubit quantum system by 2030. In fact, IonQ’s acquisition of the UK quantum computing startup Oxford Ionics a few months ago was a pivotal step to speed up this goal. With this advance, the big question is whether it can drive even more explosive gains in IonQ’s stock. The stock has already surged 500% in the last year, but could it climb another 10x from here, reaching $400 a share? It can. In the sections below, we outline what could enable that outcome. That said, if you want upside exposure with lower single-stock risk, consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which has delivered >91% returns since inception while outperforming the S&P 500 with lower volatility. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? IonQ is a high-risk, high-reward name with significant upside potential. Its trapped-ion technology and cloud-first strategy could provide an edge. To realize that potential, the company must sustain technical leadership, convert research into real-world applications, and monetize partnerships. For investors comfortable with risk, IonQ offers a way to invest directly in the future of quantum computing. However, meaningful risks remain in this early-stage space. Alternatively, explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to capitalize on strong markets while limiting downside when conditions deteriorate, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Highest-Paid TV Hosts Of 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2025/09/12/the-highest-paid-tv-hosts-of-2025/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T10:00:00Z

ByMatt Craig, Forbes Staff. Nowhere is the structural decline of linear television more on full display than in late night. For decades, the shows were reliable cash cows for the networks, but in recent years analysts estimate that none turn a profit. Then, in July, CBS made the abrupt decision to cancel The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing $40 million in losses per year. And both ABC and NBC trimmed budgets last fall by moving to four-nights-per-week, whether their hosts wanted to or not. “I was bummed,” Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon tells Forbes. “I want to do it five days a week. I love doing it.” Still, a late-night talk show gig comes with a salary that places Fallon ($16 million), Jimmy Kimmel ($16 million) and Stephen Colbert ($15 million) among the highest-paid hosts on television, according to Forbes estimates. Even in its diminished state, linear television still generates significant revenue for networks, and it’s the talent from categories like late-night, morning shows, primetime news, sports and lifestyle who remain TV’s biggest stars. Combined, the top 25 hosts earn an estimated $582 million. With few exceptions, they make far more money than the stars of TV’s hit scripted shows. But with late-night extinction seemingly on the horizon, many have begun questioning whether hosts like Fallon will be the last to lead their respective programs—even one as long-running and venerable as The Tonight Show, which NBC has aired since 1954. “Oh gosh,” Fallon says, while contemplating whether he will be Tonight’s last host. “No, there'll be someone else. And I don't think it'll be a robot. I think it has to be a human being that makes mistakes and has a real conversation with people.” At the very least, it’s almost certain that this generation of TV stars will be the last mega-earners the medium ever produces. Most in the top 25 hosts have been in the spotlight for decades, and across the board, agents and managers report a strong downward pressure on compensation during contract renewal negotiations. Often the best that top talent can hope for is to maintain their salary from past years, and in many cases networks require work on additional shows or projects to justify staying at the same level financially. For example, in addition to late-night, Fallon and Kimmel now host game shows for their respective networks. Elsewhere, celebrity chefs are still living extra-large. Guy Fieri ($33 million), Bobby Flay ($33 million) and Gordon Ramsay ($33 million) each oversee a small universe of shows, and have earned overall production deals similar to those given to top scripted TV showrunners, trading profit participation for guaranteed annual fees. The details of these deals are usually closely guarded secrets. When one leaks out, like Fieri’s three-year, $100 million deal with the Food Network in late 2023, it can cause a correction in the market as competitors demand the same compensation—as was the case for Flay and Ramsay. And large contracts make for bad optics when networks have layoffs. Disney, for example, cut nearly 200 jobs from its ABC News and Disney Entertainment Networks divisions in March, just a few months after renewing Good Morning America’s George Stephanopolous for an estimated $17 million annually. The exception to this trend is sports, where salaries have risen sharply in recent years and new talent has had the opportunity to break-in. Sports broadcasters and studio personalities account for eight of the top 25 this year, including seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, who, as a Fox football analyst, tops the list at $37.5 million annually. In the not-too-distant past, the idea that sports broadcasters could make more money than the athletes they talk about would have been ludicrous. But with media companies shelling out billions for league rights, and those games becoming by far the most-watched events on television, paying a few million more for premium talent is seen both as an insurance policy for content quality and also an incentive for leagues to steer their best games to the network. The 48-year-old Brady was hired, for example, to bring star power to Fox’s NFL broadcasts after Troy Aikman ($18 million) and Joe Buck ($16 million) were lured away to call ESPN’s biggest football games. “As sports becomes a differentiator, and as sports rights become more precious and expensive, given both the attention and the number of entities negotiating for them, that certainly causes other content formats and money to be pushed out,” says Neal Zuckerman, a managing director and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. “There's only so much you can spend on content in order to make a reasonably profitable business.” Another bright spot on the list is the number of women who are represented. Three hosts —Judy Sheindlen ($30 million), Rachel Maddow and Robin Roberts (both at $25 million)—are among the 10 highest-paid personalities on TV, while two more, Savannah Guthrie ($24 million) and Kelly Ripa ($22 million), rank among the top 15. But those outsize paydays will soon come to an end. Streaming platforms do not offer talent salaries comparable to the largest TV deals. Instead, platforms like YouTube share 55% of ad revenue with creators, incentivizing talent to bet on themselves. When the model works, it gives hosts bargaining power, as is the case with Pat McAfee ($20 million), who maintains ownership and editorial control of his daily talk show while licensing it to ESPN for a hefty fee (a portion of those earnings go toward paying his staff and production costs). Many in the industry believe there will be more deals like his in the future. In the meantime, here are the hosts commanding the most. Television insiders say the true value of Fox's Hail Mary deal to land the seven-time Super Bowl champion after his retirement from football in 2022 is impossible to calculate, since some of his compensation is in company stock (the price of which has risen significantly since Brady signed). In addition to his duties in the commentary booth, which began last fall to mixed reviews, Brady serves as a Fox ambassador in a number of company functions, which are used to justify the enormous compensation package. The mayor of Flavortown reset the market for lifestyle talent with his three-year, $100 million overall deal signed in late 2023, making him the highest-paid talent at the Food Network after it merged with Warner Bros. Discovery a year earlier. The 57-year-old restauranteur has made nearly 600 episodes of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives since it debuted in 2007, and he produces or appears in numerous programs across the WBD portfolio. Overall deals like Flay’s, which was renewed in November to match Fieri's annual total, charges every talent, producing and personal appearance fee, and in some cases even cuts of ancillary businesses like physical products and restaurants, against a set annual total. To make the deal worth it, the 60-year-old chef will have to stay busy, with Bobby’s Triple Threat debuting earlier this month and two other shows, Beat Bobby Flay and BBQ Brawl, currently in production. Much like the other top chefs on TV, Ramsay has set up a mini-universe of culinary shows for Fox, including Hell’s Kitchen, MasterChef, and Next Level Chef, enough to land the same top-of-market overall deal value in March. Yet unlike Bobby Flay and Guy Fieri, the 58-year-old Ramsay currently holds eight Michelin stars in his restaurant group and 40 million followers on TikTok, where he blew up during the pandemic roasting other users’ cooking videos. HBO's late-night offering Last Week Tonight is an Emmys juggernaut—winning 30 statues in the past 10 years—and drives an impressive amount of sign-ups to the re-rechristened HBO Max, which is how its 48-year-old host has earned a deal nearly double the size of what his late-night colleagues make at the networks. Much to Oliver's dismay, last year Warner Bros. Discovery hoped to maximize streaming engagement by delaying the posting of the show's clips to YouTube for several days, but reversed course with the 12th season in February. $30 million In her heyday, Judge Judy commanded more than $45 million per year for her eponymous show and owned the rights to its catalog of episodes. Since selling the rights back to CBS and leaving the network in 2021 (she remains a producer on the network's Hot Bench), the 82-year-old Sheindlin has started up three new court shows on Amazon's streaming channels. In a 2024 deal renewal, Amazon began syndicating Judy Justice and Tribunal Justice out to hundreds of local TV stations, an important bargaining chip to maintain her lofty fees. Last September, Seacrest replaced the legendary Pat Sajak as the host of Wheel of Fortune, in addition to his regular hosting duties on American Idol and ABC’s New Years Eve program (which he also produces). Add in his radio show, which runs for four hours every weekday and pays him more than $10 million per year, and the 50-year-old host is almost never not on the air. Strahan is earning more money as a TV host than he ever did as a Hall of Fame defensive end for the New York Giants. He has lucrative deals with both Fox, as a studio analyst on the network's NFL coverage, and with ABC, to co-host Good Morning America and The $100,000 Pyramid. In addition to his TV work, Strahan also has revenue from personal appearances and his company, SMAC Entertainment, a talent management company that houses his personal brand. While meteoric talents have come and gone from Fox News, the 63-year-old Hannity has been at the network since its inception in 1996, making him the longest-running primetime host in cable history. And these days, TV isn't even his main gig—Hannity’s syndicated radio program reaches more than 600 stations nationwide, and his ownership stake in the show earns him more than $30 million each year. During an MSNBC contract renewal in late 2024, it's estimated that Maddow took a salary cut from $30 million annually to $25 million (a network spokesperson disputed the reported number), two years after switching from a five-nights-a-week schedule to appearing only on Mondays. Still, she remains the face of the recently rebranded MS NOW and has found other platforms to share her political commentary, including a weekly podcast and a handful of best-selling books. Morning shows are not only still highly profitable, in the case of Good Morning America, Forbes estimates the show accounts for the majority of ABC’s broadcast news revenue. That’s why the 64-year-old Roberts, who has co-anchored GMA for more than 20 years and has overseen the network’s No. 1 position in the ratings for the last 13 years consecutively, is the highest-paid talent at ABC. She also hosts primetime specials, such as a 20-year anniversary retrospective on Hurricane Katrina, which aired in late August. Going toe-to-toe with Donald Trump at a town hall in 2020 led to a massive pay raise for the 53-year-old Today host, who was the highest-paid member of the show even before the departure of co-host Hoda Kotb in January, because of her ability to handle important political interviews for NBC as well as holiday specials like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony. The 54-year-old morning show fixture has been through many co-hosts since taking the Live! job in early 2001, working with Regis Philbin, Michael Strahan and Ryan Seacrest before being paired with her husband, Mark Consuelos, in 2023. The duo also have a separate series on ESPN, Running With The Wolves, cataloging their journey owning Italian soccer club Campobasso FC. Just a few years into a 10-year, $210 million contract with Turner Sports, Barkley threatened to retire last fall after his network lost the rights to broadcast NBA games. Instead, a deal was struck allowing Inside The NBA to continue being produced by Turner—keeping in place Barkley’s long-time co-hosts Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O’Neal (who Forbes estimates makes $15 million for the role)— but air before and after games on ESPN and ABC. In March, the reigning champion of sports talk shows got a pay bump from $12 million to $20 million annually, believed to be the largest contract ever given to an ESPN talent. As part of the new deal, Stephen A. will actually appear on fewer ESPN programs, freeing up time for projects such as his podcast—and though he's denied it many times, perhaps a run at presidential politics. ESPN's deal with the former Indiana Colts punter includes talent fees for his work on College Gameday and a licensing fee to air The Pat McAfee Show on the network, which the 38-year-old host uses to pay his staff and production costs. The deal structure means less take-home pay, but he maintains ownership and editorial control of the program. McAfee also served as a longtime commentator for WWE matches until June, when he stepped back from the role, citing fatigue. ESPN’s desire to have a Super Bowl-ready broadcast team for the 2026 season came at a price, luring the Hall of Famer away from Fox with a contract that is just a wee bit larger than the one CBS gave to fellow former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Romo’s total includes money he pays to a traveling editorial assistant and spotter on game days. Romo’s 10-year, $180 million deal with CBS kicked off an earnings bonanza in early 2020, ushering in the era where NFL broadcast talent can earn more money than most of the players on the field. While the ex-Dallas Cowboys quarterback still sits in the No. 1 booth with Jim Nantz, he could soon be feeling the pressure around the corner from former defensive end JJ Watt, who was recently signed to CBS' No. 2 team. Though Cooper serves as an occasional correspondent to CBS’ 60 Minutes, the real money comes from his work on CNN, where he hosts a primetime show every weeknight and a weekly deep dive show on Sundays. The 58-year-old has been at the network since 2001. Since 2010, Harvey has hosted more than 1,100 episodes of Family Feud, not including international versions and spin-offs. One of those, Celebrity Family Feud, had its biggest season premiere in three years in July, attracting 4.2 million viewers. The 68-year-old earns also earns several million from a syndicated radio show on weekday mornings. A verbal slip-up from the Good Morning America co-host last fall led to Donald Trump’s libel lawsuit against ABC and the network’s subsequent $15 million settlement payout. But ABC immediately backed the 64-year-old political veteran, renewing his deal in December. In addition to GMA and This Week With George Stephanopolous, the pact includes a new politics show on Hulu and four hour-long primetime specials, though it’s ABC’s David Muir, not Stephanopolous, who will continue to host the network’s special news reports. In one of the more unique sports media moves in recent history, Fox let Joe Buck out of the last year of his contract in 2022 to join booth partner Troy Aikman at ESPN, in exchange for the broadcast rights to a Penn State-Purdue college football game. The 56-year-old Buck is now the highest-paid play-by-play announcer in sports history, and though he called a record 24 World Series at his previous network, he’s largely stuck to Monday Night Football at ESPN, outside of a few one-off MLB games like this year’s Opening Day Brewers-Yankees game. $16 million With a show ready-made for social media, Fallon’s The Tonight Show dominates late-night competitors in the digital space—but remains third in the ratings. And the 50-year-old host has found another use for his joyful enthusiasm, hosting game shows like Password and That’s My Jam as well as a new reality competition show On Brand that debuts on NBC on September 30. ABC’s late-night host since 2003, Kimmel has publicly mulled retirement for years and has a contract that will expire in mid-2026. Outside of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the 57-year-old comedian hosts the rebooted celebrity version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and voiced a character in this summer’s Smurfs movie. During this Emmy season, Kimmel has actively campaigned for his direct competitor, Stephen Colbert, calling CBS’s claims that Colbert’s show was losing $40 million per year “beyond nonsensical." Colbert is a favorite to win the Emmy for Outstanding Talk Series this weekend, which would be his first win as host of The Late Show—though he did previously win 10 for The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. The 61-year-old host will remain on CBS until next May, and news of his cancellation has only juiced his viewership ratings further over his competitors. Estimations were calculated through interviews with agents, lawyers, managers, executives and industry experts. The figures represent pretax earnings specifically for TV work, though many talents on the list earn significant additional income from radio, endorsements, entrepreneurial ventures, personal appearances, investments or other categories. Fees for representation (agent, manager, lawyer etc.) are not deducted. Hosts are compensated with variety of deal structures, including traditional salaries, overall production deals for a slate of projects, or licensing agreements from which a talent pays staff and production costs. The above rankings estimate the total earnings paid by media companies to talent.

Title: AT&T tracked employee attendance to find 'freeloaders.' Now, it admits the system is driving workers to the 'brink of frustration.'

AT&T is reducing its reliance on an employee-attendance tracking system, admitting to workers that it hasn't been fully accurate and is "driving people to the brink of frustration." The system, known internally as presence reporting, automatically tracks the hours workers spend at their assigned office. Most are required to log at least eight hours a day, five days a week, on-site. The telecom giant is one of several companies, including Amazon, JP Morgan, and Microsoft, tightening return-to-office mandates and using new tech to track employee compliance. Executives at these companies say the moves boost collaboration and productivity. In a meeting last month, chief marketing and growth officer Kellyn Kenny said her division is reducing its reliance on presence tracking in response to employee concerns about the system and its accuracy. The system was originally introduced to identify employees who weren't showing up in the office. "We recognize that there's things about the report that are not correct," she said, according to audio obtained by Business Insider. "It is not something that I expect anybody to be looking at on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis." AT&T is also deemphasizing use of the tracking system for salaried employees companywide, a person familiar with the matter said. CEO John Stankey indicated in a memo to staffers last month (reported exclusively by Business Insider) that AT&T was shifting its use of behavioral data, such as presence reports. "We analyze patterns of behaviors from broad cohorts," he wrote, "to determine if the behavior being evaluated is consistent with our stated priorities and employment expectations." Stankey said that an individual's data must differ "significantly" from their peers before their name is attached to the behavior. "Some may view this approach as a matter of trust, and that perspective is understandable. In several forums, I've expressed concerns that past data indicated more outliers than we'd like," he said. Kenny said during the August meeting that the employee survey (which prompted the blunt memo from Stankey) had "lots of feedback" about the presence reports. She said the survey included critiques from workers who said they were struggling to make it to doctors' appointments without running afoul of the system, for example. Read more about Stankey's memo. While the survey does not appear to have included a direct question about presence reporting, it did ask whether employees agreed that AT&T's "policies and systems support me in delivering my best work." Kenny said in the meeting that roughly half of the respondents in her organization said "no," and that many voiced their concerns about the RTO mandate and presence reports in the freeform response. "I now understand the level of anxiety that this report has created," Kenny said. "I also now understand how the fact that it is inaccurate is driving people to the brink of frustration, and it's creating distrust." Business Insider has spoken with roughly a dozen employees from multiple divisions of the company this year about the system and its impact on their workplace experience. A spokesperson for AT&T declined to comment for this story, instead citing Stankey's August memo. Multiple employees told Business Insider that the system doesn't just log badge swipes at the entrance or exit; the presence report uses laptop network connections and mobile device location data to infer the hours an employee was at their assigned office. The tool was rolled out in response to the RTO push that began two years ago, and its usage ramped up as the attendance policy grew increasingly strict. Other companies, like Amazon and JP Morgan in particular, have also closely monitored employee behavior at work. Amazon previously used categories like "inconsistent badger" or "zero badger" depending on an employee's compliance with a three-day in-office mandate. The company ended up nixing the labels in favor of providing raw badging data to managers to use at their discretion. A recent survey by commercial real-estate company CBRE found that more than two-thirds of employers track employee compliance with attendance policies, and more than a third have taken some level of enforcement action. Enforcement that is too strict or error-prone can cause other headaches within an organization — pushing out experienced employees, making it harder to hire new talent, or undermining motivation and trust within the organization. Amazon's internal documents from last year indicated that its RTO policy was hampering its ability to recruit top AI talent, and a Harvard leadership expert said Meta's abruptly shifting RTO effort in 2023 was likely to cause a "huge amount of distrust" in the company. At the AT&T marketing and growth team meeting, Kenny said that the system helped leadership identify "freeloaders" who showed up for 30 minutes or two hours per day. "There were people who badged in for 10 minutes, got themselves a cup of coffee, and then left," she said. "The report was good for identifying the people who were abusing the system. We do not need this report for that purpose anymore, because we took action on the people who were the free riders." AT&T did not specify how many workers have been disciplined or dismissed in connection with their presence report information. AT&T workers told Business Insider that apparent glitches in the system could also be a hassle for employees who were pulling their weight. They said that in the first few months of this year, while the five-day RTO mandate was phasing in, their reports could be wrong by as many as several hours. In addition, briefly badging into an AT&T facility on a day off could trigger a person's daily average hours to drop below the mandatory eight hours for the week. "It was at its worst in March and April," one worker in New Jersey told Business Insider. "Sometimes you'd step out for lunch, and then it would stop counting." Though there were no immediate consequences from an incorrect report, employees were concerned the erroneous data could make them targets for layoffs. Some other business leaders have said RTO mandates have "encouraged" workers to quit voluntarily, allowing companies to avoid more expensive layoffs. AT&T previously told Business Insider the goal of its in-office rules is to foster better collaboration. It has also undertaken a multiyear effort to shrink its workforce. The company started this year with around 140,000 employees, down from more than 160,000 at the start of 2023. Telecom competitors Verizon and T-Mobile started 2025 with 99,000 and 70,000, respectively. Stankey has said that the company is looking to cut some $6 billion in costs as it decommissions its legacy copper-based network in favor of new fiber and 5G technologies. One worker in Georgia said that the presence reports changed the workplace reality for many salaried managerial workers, who aren't used to such detailed tracking of their workday. "We're supposed to be able to work a more flexible thing as long as we get our work done," he said. Another effect of the crackdown on underperformers has been the erosion of motivation for some higher performers to put in extra time. "The attitude has shifted," the New Jersey employee said. "They only count eight hours, so I'm just going to work eight hours." The AT&T employees Business Insider spoke with said their presence reports have gotten more accurate over the past few months. One shared their report with annotations that showed such an improvement. The question of employees' trust could take more than a few months to resolve. Have a tip?

Title: How AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom Can Ride Oracle’s $455B Cloud Surge

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, during its earnings announcement, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) delivered a striking revelation that surprised even the most optimistic analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) for its cloud division surged 359% year-over-year, reaching $455 billion, compared to only $138 billion in the previous quarter. This astonishing increase caused Oracle’s stock to rise nearly 36% in Wednesday’s trading, marking its largest single-day gain in many years. Consider RPO as Oracle’s guaranteed revenue stream—contracts that have already been finalized and are just pending execution. This is not speculative thinking or hopeful forecasts; it represents money that customers have already committed. CEO Safra Catz stated that Oracle anticipates securing several additional multi-billion-dollar customers soon, pushing its RPO beyond the half-trillion-dollar threshold within months. Here’s a brief overview of how the major AI silicon players will reap benefits from Oracle’s significant initiative. How Oracle Stock Surges 3x To $900? For Oracle, turning these obligations into revenue hinges on the speed at which it can expand its infrastructure. This necessitates electricity, regulatory approvals, and high-performance GPUs, all of which are still in persistent global shortage. The corporation also increased its capital expenditure projection to $35 billion for fiscal 2026—a 65% rise that highlights the urgency of its AI infrastructure expansion. It’s no surprise that this exceptional guidance caused shares of Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD to climb between 2% and 10%, as these chip manufacturers form the foundation of nearly every AI implementation. Each additional Oracle contract should correspond to increased demand for their semiconductors. Furthermore, in contrast to cloud competitors like Google, AWS, or Microsoft, Oracle is not developing its own bespoke AI chips. Instead, it has relied on GPUs from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Oracle maintains a robust partnership with AI compute standard bearer Nvidia, which provides most of the GPUs currently utilized in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Oracle stands out among hyperscalers by offering so-called “bare metal” instances alongside Nvidia GPUs. This affords customers direct, exclusive access to high-end physical chips like A10, A100, H100, H200, and the flagship Blackwell chips, eliminating virtualization overhead. Such a setup enables businesses to optimize performance for model training and inference. Oracle’s AI supercomputers deploy these GPUs in densely packed, liquid-cooled data centers engineered for energy efficiency and throughput. This close collaboration allows Oracle to cater to some of the most sophisticated AI applications globally at scale. Nvidia GPUs have been the backbone of Oracle’s AI infrastructure, and this partnership may prove vital as Oracle carries out its extensive AI contracts in the upcoming years. Nvidia Stock To Fall 50% As AI Cycle Turns? Oracle has also been diversifying away from solely relying on Nvidia. In June, Oracle and AMD revealed that the AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs would be available on OCI, providing more than double the price-performance of the previous generation. Oracle plans to deploy as many as 131,072 MI355X GPUs, empowering enterprises to build, train, and perform inference on massive AI models with competitive economics. This collaboration guarantees that AMD will secure a significant portion of Oracle’s AI expenditures. The MI355X, based on AMD’s new CDNA 4 architecture and TSMC’s 3nm process, marks AMD’s most significant advancement yet in AI accelerators. For Oracle, this strategy broadens its hardware alternatives, diminishes reliance on a single supplier, and is expected to enhance negotiation leverage with Nvidia for GPUs, thereby controlling overall spending. Oracle’s revenue outlook is increasingly linked to AI inference, which involves executing trained models at scale for real-time user queries. Buy or Sell AVGO Stock at $360? As AI transitions from development to widespread use, inference workloads are likely to significantly exceed training requirements, resulting in a recurring, utility-like demand stream. This is precisely where Broadcom and its custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) could emerge as substantial beneficiaries. While GPUs are predominant in training, inference at scale is expected to increasingly favor custom chips that provide better cost and energy efficiency. While Oracle still primarily utilizes GPUs for AI tasks, it appears that ASICs will undoubtedly play a more substantial role moving forward. This trend helps clarify why Broadcom’s stock surged nearly 10% on Wednesday—surpassing the gains of Nvidia and AMD, which increased by 2% to 4%—as investors speculate that Broadcom’s custom chips will capture part of Oracle’s workload. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a demonstrated track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, including the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What drives this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have produced superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, delivering a smoother experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How a $1 billion TikTok challenger unraveled
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-tiktok-challenger-flip-unraveled-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-12T09:30:02Z
Full Content:
Flip employees were riding high in mid-January. The TikTok challenger had just cracked the Apple App Store's top-five ranking. Downloads soared 855% month over month, Sensor Tower data showed, fueled by TikTok's imminent ban in the US. It was a dream scenario for an app that — with over $230 million in funding and a roughly $1.1 billion valuation — promised to reinvent social shopping through a mix of product reviews and entertaining videos. Raging wildfires had forced Flip's CEO, Noor Agha, to evacuate his Los Angeles home before he had time to retrieve his car or pack an extra pair of underwear. But in a January 15 interview with Agha and COO Eduardo Vivas, the executives sounded upbeat, if not a little frenzied. "To be in the business that we're in, given all the changes that are happening, is obviously very exciting for us," Vivas said at the time. Seven months later, Flip was dead. This is the story of how Flip crashed, as told by nine former employees, along with investors, creator partners, talent managers, and brands. Agha, Vivas, and other company representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Days after Business Insider's interview with Flip's top executives, President Donald Trump halted the TikTok ban. Flip raced to sustain its momentum, pouring money into ads and launching a $100 million equity fund to woo creators. With TikTok back in play, the buzz fizzled. Things unraveled quickly from there. In April, Trump tariffs raised costs for some Flip vendors and brand partners. Then Flip slashed jobs and began clearing out its LA headquarters. In May, the company received an eviction notice for its LA warehouse. By June, the company had slipped out of Apple's US App Store top 100, and within weeks, it cut much of its remaining staff without severance, three ex-staffers said. Flip shut down its app in late August. The company's demise caught many off guard. Employees who had watched a spike in downloads and onboarding of new brands believed business was humming. "I was as shocked as I could have been when that last round of layoffs came and how quickly it dissolved from there," one former Flip worker said. "This year, there were very optimistic conversations about where we were going and the idea that this was going to become huge." Flip's fate showcases the uphill battle that consumer startups face when trying to compete with tech giants like TikTok, Meta, or Google. The company spent millions of dollars to recruit creators and onboard new users via ads and referral credits. But competing with Big Tech companies, which have billions of users and the ability to outspend you at every turn, is no easy task. "It's actually crazy to build a new complete social platform from scratch," Agha told Business Insider in January. "The amount of pieces to make a social platform work is so insanely hard." It also demonstrates how difficult it has been for US companies to blend social video and commerce. TikTok has struggled to live up to its leadership's expectations for its e-commerce platform, Shop. Meta pulled back on some of its e-commerce bets, and Amazon killed its TikTok-like feed, Inspire, earlier this year. "Changing shopping behaviors is a slow and gradual process," said Sky Canaves, a principal analyst on the retail and e-commerce desk at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. "It takes time." Agha, who was born in Iraq, launched Flip in 2019 alongside cofounder Jonathan Ellman. Like many other founders, Agha is brimming with big ideas. "This was his app, his dream, his world he wanted to create," one former staffer said. Flip's original business idea was a try-before-you-buy social network where customers would receive clothing in the mail, take photos of the fits, and ask other users to vote on which items they should purchase. Fashion tech was in vogue, with apps like Snapchat experimenting with virtual try-on technology. Some entrepreneurs were eyeing China's massive social-shopping industry and considering how they might bring the business to the US. Live-shopping platform Whatnot had just kicked off in the US, later raising hundreds of millions of dollars at a roughly $5 billion valuation. While TikTok hadn't yet launched Shop in the US, it had begun experimenting with e-commerce features like in-video shopping links. By August 2021, when Flip announced its $28 million Series A round, the company had pivoted from try-ons to user-generated product reviews and live shopping videos. Flip was "well-positioned to follow in the footsteps of China and revolutionize social commerce in the US," investor Ullas Naik of Streamlined Ventures said at the time. Flush with cash, the company moved to grow its audience, unveiling a creator program in December 2021 that would pay users commissions on sales generated through their videos. Big social-media stars like Patrick Starrr, Hyram Yarbro, and Addison "Rae" Easterling joined the app. The company was growing quickly, writing in a July 2022 press release that it had expanded its user base by 500% in the first half of that year. Flip fundraised on that growth, announcing in July a $60 million Series B round at a $500 million valuation. That same year, the company moved into a new three-floor office in the El Segundo neighborhood of LA. The office had many of the markers of a buzzy tech startup. Workers had access to free coffee and snacks like Uncrustables. There was even a trampoline, which no one used, three former employees said. Music blared over the speakers, with one electronic track on repeat that Agha particularly enjoyed, three ex-staffers said. "The vibes in the building were always high energy," a third ex-employee said. While the company said it planned to use its 2022 funding to expand its team, it generally kept its head count lean. Much of the company worked in its El Segundo headquarters, where it required staffers to be in person five days a week. Some workers in functions like data entry were asked to work six days a week, with overtime pay. "It was a very intense startup vibe," said the first ex-staffer. "The people that work here are fully bought in." To keep growing in 2023, the company splurged on referrals, offering in-app credits sometimes worth over $100 to get new users signed up and scrolling more, The Information and The Free Press reported. In April 2024, Flip raised a $144 million round with participation from the adtech firm AppLovin, doubling its valuation to around $1.1 billion. A couple of months earlier, it had formed a partnership with AppLovin to power ads for brands on Flip. Around the time of the investment, the company also acquired Curated, a platform that connected shoppers with experts for advice on big purchases, for $330 million in stock. Curated's CEO at the time, Vivas, became Flip's chief operating officer. Vivas, a serial entrepreneur and high school dropout who previously sold a startup to LinkedIn, was on AppLovin's board of directors. The company was racing to expand Flip's user base as it sought to take on the industry's goliath: TikTok Shop. Like social-shopping competitor LTK, the company believed it had to expand beyond pure shopping content. Flip launched a new set of non-shopping videos, called Clips, in July 2024. "We think of shopping as a form of entertainment," Vivas told Business Insider in January. "People do it to have fun and enjoy themselves, but a feed cannot just be shopping content." Riding off the tailwinds of the looming TikTok ban, Flip downloads spiked. The company also invested in a stream of ads on TikTok to lure creators. Inside the company, staffers saw the surge of new users as a breakthrough moment. "We all thought it was going to take off from there," the first former Flip employee said. There was a feeling that "we made it past all of the hard parts of being a startup," they said. To boost non-shopping content, Flip pledged $100 million to its "Founding Creators Fund." It promised creators "grants" of up to $100,000 that would scale with Flip's valuation — so long as the creators kept posting to the app. Contracts set a five-year timeline for payouts, unless an acquisition triggered them earlier. Overall, a mix of user acquisition costs and macroeconomic headwinds stunted Flip's push to take on TikTok Shop. "It was ultimately just unsustainable because they had these very high customer acquisition costs as well as customer retention costs," Canaves said. And as Trump delayed the TikTok ban multiple times, the desperate hunt for an alternative lost its urgency. "It is really challenging for new apps to break through," Canaves said. "I think they struggled to scale in the way that they wanted to." Flip wrote on its website last month that its mission of building a "social platform that gave everyone a voice" had come to a close. It said it had reached 16.5 million people, crossed 5 billion video views, paid $13.4 million to creators, and driven $375 million in sales for brands. The statement didn't provide a reason for the closure. The app's shuttering caught some brand partners off guard. Haak Wear, a hat seller, addressed the Flip shutdown in a blog post on its website. "This situation has reminded us of the importance of having multiple touchpoints with our community," the company wrote. Five former staffers said they felt out of the loop on the health of the business while working at Flip. Flip is not the only tech platform to make big promises to partners and then shut its doors. Buzzy shopping app Nate abruptly closed its creator program in December 2022, for example. "It wasn't surprising that the app was going to shut down at some point," said Tara Blair Ball, a creator in Flip's Founding Creator Fund. "I don't think it made sense how they were making money to warrant the pay that they were giving." Even as Flip's downloads were surging in January, Agha acknowledged that merging social media with commerce is challenging in the US market. "It's definitely crazy freaking hard," Agha said during the January interview. "Almost killed us a thousand times. No question." Have a tip?

US tech titans are spending huge sums to win the AI race — and the ones that lose could see their stock prices take a hit, "Bond King" Bill Gross has warned. The billionaire investor gave his thoughts to Business Insider after Oracle's market value surged by as much as 43%, or nearly $300 billion, on Wednesday, thanks to an AI-driven revenue projection. "My biggest concern is what economists refer to as 'malinvestment,' Gross said in an email. Gross — who cofounded the fixed-income titan PIMCO and grew its flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly three decades — said the tech giants are racing to dominate various AI sectors and "seem willing to risk over-investment in hopes of future monopolies." "Some will fail and current trends — and stock prices based on them — may experience significantly reduced growth," Gross said. He singled out AI data centers and the "hundreds of billions" being spent on them by companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. Electricity providers are also "gearing up to supply them," he added. AI companies are investing vast sums in microchips, servers, and other infrastructure they need to build and train increasingly advanced models and harness AI in other ways. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet are poised to invest more than $300 billion into AI this year. The immense buzz around AI has lit a fire under tech stocks. Shares of the nine most valuable tech companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Broadcom, Tesla, and Oracle — have all more than doubled since the start of 2023, with Nvidia surging about 12-fold and Meta leaping around six-fold. The group's combined market value now exceeds $22 trillion. Jump to

Title: Larry Ellison is back on top, 48 years after he co-founded Oracle

Business FILE PHOTO: Larry Ellison reacts, at the White House, in Washington, U.S. February 3, 2025. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File photo SAN FRANCISCO :Fortune magazine wondered on its cover whether Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison might become the world's richest person, while BusinessWeek declared Ellison is "cool again," noting that "Silicon Valley's bad boy is having his revenge." Both were published 25 years ago, but they could've run this week. The octogenarian Ellison is back in headlines after Oracle announced a clutch of cloud computing deals that rocked the tech world and sent its stock up 35.9 per cent, putting Ellison's fortune close to $400 billion, second globally only to Elon Musk. Then on Thursday, news broke that Paramount, the media conglomerate Ellison's family now controls, is preparing a bid to buy out the storied Warner Bros Discovery, threatening overnight to dominate Hollywood and culture. The swashbuckling billionaire may have been known more for his yacht collection, his ownership of a Hawaiian island or his longstanding support of Donald Trump.

At Paramount, his son David appears to be tilting CBS News toward the right, tapping Trump supporter and former CEO of conservative think tank Hudson Institute Kenneth Weinstein as ombudsman for CBS News. He also is reportedly considering The Free Press's Bari Weiss for a leadership role at the news organization.Ellison has also got his hands on TikTok. In 2022, Oracle began providing U.S. tech infrastructure to the short video-sharing platform after national security questions arose over the Chinese-owned service used by over 170 million Americans.Some probably have forgotten that Ellison's brash tactics and lavish lifestyles earned him the role of bad boy of Silicon Valley since he co-founded Oracle in 1977.In 2010, he played himself in "Iron Man 2." Remarkably, Ellison has honed a reputation as an uber tech titan and playboy while tackling decidedly unsexy, vexingly hard computing challenges. Recently, he helped figure out how to string together thousands of computers to run artificial intelligence systems.Massive, AI-level money was more elusive until the latest quarter, when the cloud deals juiced Oracle's stock price.Oracle vanquished database rivals in the 1990s, then missed nearly a decade of the sales and stock market gains from the wholesale shift of business applications to the cloud.While AI shows tremendous promise for Oracle, success is far from certain, given that the entire industry is still working on a profitable business model. Also, Oracle has tied itself particularly closely to a single company - OpenAI, which, according to a person familiar with the matter, is committed to paying Oracle $300 billion for computing resources over five years.DON'T COMPETE WITH NVIDIAOracle became an AI landlord, courting marquee customers including Meta and Elon Musk's xAI in addition to its new biggest client, OpenAI. That shift has helped booked revenue surge more than four-fold to $455 billion.“People have definitely questioned him over the years," said Matthew Durot, deputy editor for wealth at Forbes, which calculates his fortune. With Oracle's focus on AI, "He’s sort of got the last laugh - at least for now."One key decision helped: Oracle chose not to build custom AI chips like Microsoft, Amazon and Google. The decision to instead rely on Nvidia has likely helped it get more chips from the global leader of AI processors, analysts said. Ellison himself led the way.At a dinner in 2024, Ellison took Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to Nobu, his Palo Alto sushi restaurant. "Please take our money," Ellison said he told Huang. "It worked," Ellison added in an earnings call with equity analysts. Within several months of that sushi dinner, Oracle landed more GPUs, closed a compute deal with OpenAI and announced a splashy half a trillion dollars OpenAI computing project, Stargate.Oracle's first cloud venture in 2016 ended in business disaster but a second, launched in 2018, was a service that proved cheaper and more flexible than other offerings.In 2020, when Zoom Technologies was buckling under a crush of new traffic during the pandemic, it tapped Oracle's cloud and its hiccups and outages all but vanished. In 2022, when TikTok moved the data of more than 100 million U.S. users to Oracle's cloud, the changeover went largely unnoticed by users. Analysts called this a major technical feat.HUGE RISKS REMAINEllison is known for piling up injuries in extreme sports, and Oracle's rush into AI shows a taste for risk.The company does not buy land, build data centers or power plants. It outsources all those functions to partners, who may or may not come through, said Chirag Dekate, a vice president and analyst at research firm Gartner. It also remains to be seen whether partners such as OpenAI can amass the capital to pay Oracle, since OpenAI is still building a business it hopes will be profitable. "When you have just one handful of customers, and one of those customers goes away, you are left with a really large hole that you now need to figure out how to fill," Dekate said. More recently, with little fanfare, he has plotted his way back to the center of power.

Business FILE PHOTO: Larry Ellison reacts, at the White House, in Washington, U.S. February 3, 2025. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File photo SAN FRANCISCO :Fortune magazine wondered on its cover whether Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison might become the world's richest person, while BusinessWeek declared Ellison is "cool again," noting that "Silicon Valley's bad boy is having his revenge." Both were published 25 years ago, but they could've run this week. The octogenarian Ellison is back in headlines after Oracle announced a clutch of cloud computing deals that rocked the tech world and sent its stock up 35.9 per cent, putting Ellison's fortune close to $400 billion, second globally only to Elon Musk. Then on Thursday, news broke that Paramount, the media conglomerate Ellison's family now controls, is preparing a bid to buy out the storied Warner Bros Discovery, threatening overnight to dominate Hollywood and culture. The swashbuckling billionaire may have been known more for his yacht collection, his ownership of a Hawaiian island or his longstanding support of Donald Trump.

Title: XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano Could Lead Explosive Altcoin Rally, Analyst Says

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto markets are “on the edge” of a broad altcoin breakout, with XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano positioned to lead, according to technical strategist CryptoInsightUK. In a video analysis released today, the analyst argues that structural signals across major charts—supported by improving macro conditions—tilt the risk-reward toward a decisive upside move, provided US inflation data doesn’t deliver a negative surprise. The setup begins with Bitcoin grinding higher into range highs while still sitting in what he calls “a position of potential reversal,” a juncture he links to today’s US CPI print after a softer-than-expected PPI reading. “If CPI comes in weak today, I think the markets will rip,” he said, framing inflation as the swing factor that could unlock risk appetite across crypto. He contends the strongest signals are emerging away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. On Ethereum, liquidity “still” sits below price around $4,100, with a pocket of resting orders above, leaving open the possibility of “a quick flush… to take that” before higher levels are attacked. “How much of a drop would we need to sweep this liquidity? Six percent,” he said, adding that the base of recent transactions “looks pretty good as a support,” even if a brief downside wick cannot be ruled out. The case for altcoins rests largely on visible liquidity concentrations and higher-timeframe structures. Cardano (ADA), he said, exhibits a favorable imbalance with “a… load of liquidity” stacked above “around one dollar,” and additional magnets in the $1.21 and $1.40 areas if momentum expands. He emphasized the sequence of higher lows and higher highs that preceded a consolidation, a pattern he compared across several charts. Dogecoin (DOGE), in his view, mirrors the same anatomy on a larger timeframe: a prior higher-high/higher-low sequence, a tightening range, and “liquidity above us,” with a push through $0.29 opening a path to targeting $0.45. “I’ve been saying for a while tokens like DOGE look like they are going to absolutely send it,” he said. For XRP, he argued that price action has “led the cycle” and recently broke a well-tracked downtrend on the daily and four-hour charts, while shorter-term liquidity maps now show concentrations overhead. Beyond single names, he anchored his thesis in market-wide breadth gauges. He highlighted “Total 3”—the combined market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—pressing against prior highs and “knocking at the door… for price discovery.” In a closely related lens, he said “Total 2” (market cap ex-Bitcoin) is one incremental push away—“half a percent higher”—from a highest-ever weekly close, with three days left in the candle. The evolving formations, he added, can be interpreted as an “ascending wedge” that morphs into a “cup and handle” after a textbook Wyckoff-style accumulation and back-test, the kind of structural progression that often resolves with a powerful range break. Rotation dynamics are at the core of his call. Drawing on an ETH-vs-BTC dominance composite, he said the tape “looks like weakness” for the pair, with heavier volume on down moves in that ratio—an indication, he believes, that capital is migrating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into the broader altcoin complex. “If [Bitcoin] dominance breaks down… it’s better for altcoins,” he said. “As long as capital’s flowing into the market, I don’t really mind which starts to outperform which… but if we have a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price and a drop in dominance, it means that altcoins are going to be absolutely sending it.” At the same time, he flagged the near-term fork in the road. Markets are testing “decision” levels into macro data, and a brief liquidity sweep lower—on Bitcoin and ETH in particular—remains plausible before any sustained impulse. “We’re not in a breakout territory here yet,” he cautioned. “We’ve seen the first signs of it… [and] we could reject here and consolidate for a little bit longer… but one catalyst here and it’s green season in my opinion for crypto generally.” Throughout the analysis, the analyst returned to a handful of price signposts traders are likely to watch: ADA gravity around $1.00 with follow-ups near $1.21 and $1.40; DOGE confirmation above ~$0.29 and then $0.45 as the next objective; and XRP’s break of descending resistance with liquidity pools sitting overhead on intraday maps. If the macro side cooperates, his base case is unambiguous. “I think the breakout is imminent,” he said, pointing to synchronized strength across Total 2 and Total 3, gold’s recent breakout, and equities at or near all-time highs. “This is the sort of time where we’re going to break out,” he added. “Massive breakouts” in altcoins, when they come, often unfold as “a few weeks or a few days of massively green candles.” Even so, he closed with a reminder that timing remains hostage to catalysts. “It’s decision time for the market,” he said. “Could reject here and consolidate… but one catalyst here and it’s green season.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.99.

Become a Member for as little as $4/mo and enjoy unlimited reading of TSLL blog. Bursting at the seams in all the right ways. We’ve got books – fiction, cookbooks, inspired by French history, hopeful books, health books and more. Films for Anglophiles and films for family reconciliation, returning favorite television dramas with engaging leading ladies, clothes – oh my! – to continue to polish your autumn wardrobe – loafers, sweaters, totes and still there is more. Did I mention there is a must-see exhibit in London to check out? Yep, that too! Art —Marie Antoinette Style exhibit at Victoria & Albert Museum, London If you will be in London between September 20th through March 22nd of 2026, and if Marie Antoinette’s style piques your interest, be sure to put a visit to the Victoria & Albert Museum on your itinerary. The Maria Antoinette Style exhibit centers around the “complex fashion icon, Marie Antoinette’s timeless appeal, [ever so much] defined by her style, youth and notoriety. Explore the lasting influence of the most fashionable (and ill-fated) queen in history – with over 250 years of design, fashion, film and art.” Books —Beyond Blue and White: The Hidden History of Delftware and the Women Behind the Iconic Ceramic by Genevieve Wheeler Brown Delft anything. Vases, tiles, bowls, you name it, most of us can identify these beautiful pieces when we see them, but where did it all begin and how did they become iconic? And more interestingly, who are the women that were part of the history that made it so? All of this is the focus of Genevieve Wheeler Brown’s new book Beyond Blue and White. Having read a recent review in the WSJ, and being fortunate to have found a Delft vase that I now regularly use and love, I always love learning more about the history of items that catch my eye, and Delftware is one of them. In the book you will “meet female Delftware makers, including Barbara Rotteveel founder of ‘The Three Bells’ Delftware factory in 1671, be introduced to female Delftware patrons such as Queen Mary II, who found her means of expression while creating a vogue in the 17th century for Delft blue and white across royal courts. And then there are the female collectors beginning in the 19th century who saw the artistry and craft in these ceramics others had overlooked. Foremost among them was Mrs. J. Pierpont Morgan and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt II who came together with fellow New York women and laid the groundwork for women in the museum world while preserving decorative arts with an educational mission.” “What begins as a curatorial exercise quickly evolves not only into an exploration of this colorful, expressive, and sometimes even humorous decorative art, coveted for hundreds of years, but also an unexpected uncovering of forceful female lives yet untold.” —Books: A Manifesto, Or, How to Build a Library by Ian Patterson Looking forward to getting my hands on this one and adding it to my library, and if you too are a fellow bibliophile, this is a book for you! Currently only available in the UK (ship to the US from Blackwells), Books: A Manifesto, or How to Build a Library is “Wise, irreverent and exhilaratingly wide-ranging” Ian Patterson “insists on reading not as a luxury but a necessary part of reality: we live within language, and when we think, it’s with the tools that reading gives us.” “Our time of cultural and political crisis demands more than books – but without them, and without the breadth of knowledge, sense of history, awareness of alternatives and hope for the future they offer, things will not get better. At once a primer for enriching your own library and a manifesto for why that matters, this book is an invitation to a deeper, richer world of thought and feeling – and a reminder of just how much books matter.” Just released yesterday on September 11th, you can find it available to ship now from Blackwells. —History Matters by David McCullough A book about and written by one of the bestselling historians of the 20th and early 21st century, History Matters, released on Tuesday the 16th, is a posthumous collection of thought-provoking essays—many never published before—[from] Pulitzer Prize–winning historian and author David McCullough affirms the value of history, how we can be guided by its lessons, and the enduring legacy of American ideals.” “Edited by McCullough’s daughter, Dorie McCullough Lawson, and his longtime researcher, Michael Hill, History Matters is a tribute to a master historian and offers fresh insights into McCullough’s enduring interests and writing life. McCullough highlights the importance of character in political leaders, with Harry Truman and George Washington serving as exemplars of American values like optimism and determination. He shares his early influences, from the books he cherished in his youth to the people who mentored him. He also pays homage to those who inspired him, such as writer Paul Horgan and painter Thomas Eakins, illustrating the diverse influences on his writing as well as the influence of art.” To be released on September 16th One of my favorite titles by McCullough was The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris —Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness by Jamil Zaki Released earlier this month, and a book determined to demonstrate how the less we know and take at face value – headlines, screaming viral social media moments, you get the idea – the more we can buy the hype of hopelessness. Thankfully, Hope for Cynics argues that “we don’t have to remain stuck in this cynicism trap. Through science and storytelling, Jamil Zaki imparts the secret for beating back cynicism: hopeful skepticism—thinking critically about people and our problems, while honoring and encouraging our strengths. Far from being naïve, hopeful skepticism is a precise way of understanding others that can rebalance our view of human nature and help us build the world we truly want.” I am here for it. Thank you Zaki for writing this book. —No Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce by Haley Mlotek While listening to book recommendations from the staff of NPR as they shared what they read and enjoyed this summer, Haley Mletek’s memoir sounded intriguing. No Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce was inspired by the author’s own navigation through divorce and comes at this often talked about subject in a different way. Released back in February, Mlotek “combines her personal story while searching social and literary exploration [to share] a deeply felt and radiant account of 21st century divorce—the remarkably common and seemingly singular experience, and what it reveals about our society and our desires for family, love, and friendship. Mlotek asks profound questions about what divorce should be, who it is for, and why the institution of marriage maintains its power, all while charting a poignant and cathartic journey away from her own marriage towards an unknown future.” —Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body by Andrew D. Huberman, Ph.D From the podcaster behind Huberman Lab, and neuroscientist and tenured professor at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Andrew Huberman “introduces Protocols, an essential guide to improving brain function, enhancing mood and energy, optimizing bodily health and physical performance, and rewiring your nervous system to learn new skills and behaviors that can transform your life.” Being released next Tuesday, “Protocols provides simple, powerful, and evidence-based solutions to life’s most common challenges. Designed to improve your mental health, physical health, and performance, these guidelines are customizable, allowing you to adapt them to your specific needs. With his clear and engaging style, Dr. Huberman explains the scientific principles behind each protocol and how they can deliver immediate, effective results.” British Finds —Barbour x Tuckernuck collection Tuckernuck has partnered up with a favorite long-standing British brand, Barbour, to come up with a collection of quite a few good items for the autumn wardrobe. Loving the scarves, the travel umbrella, and there are a few classic quilted Barbour coats to peek at was well. Don’t forget about the sweaters and button-ups. I have shopped a few below in the scroll. —SHOP THE COLLECTION: —Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale It’s here folks. Both absolutely beyond eager to watch, and yet, reticent as well. Reviewers are in agreement that the finale will please fans – read NYTimes review here, Daily Beast and AP, with The Guardian is skeptical this film will really be the true finale of the Crawleys. And at some point this weekend, I will be watching it in the theater where it deserves to be watched. If you too will be joining the throng of crowds, I hope you enjoy the two hours of this captivating family’s story we’ve been watching since September 2010. Watch an official clip from the film about why Lady Mary’s divorce occurred that begins the film. Cookbooks —Abundance: Stories and Recipes from a Gardening Cook by Mark Diacono Only available in the UK (but you can have it shipped to the US from Blackwells), Abundance: Eating And Living with the Seasons from cook and gardener Mark Diacono looks delicious both in its approach and in its ideas. “With his days distracted by the ping of communication and the tug of commitments, Mark Diacono wondered how he might better savour this one precious life. He started to write and photograph each week, hoping that this simple commitment might sharpen his appreciation of the magic in the everyday and his time spent in the kitchen. It reminds us that abundance comes in many forms – the passing of the seasons, our connection to the world around us, and the wealth that a garden, a town and its surrounding landscapes offers. “With over 80 recipes like Early summer shakshuka, Salsify and radicchio gratin, Onion seed and oregano flower focaccia, Fig leaf and olive oil ice cream, and a Mulberry martini, there are dishes to inspire and satisfy every week as the year unfolds before you.” —Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share with People You Love by Samin Nosrat Long awaited from international bestselling cookbook author and star of the Netflix series inspired by the book, Samin Nosrat’s new book Good Things will be released on Tuesday. Described as ” an essential, joyful guide to cooking and living, whether you’re looking for a comforting tomato soup to console a struggling friend, seeking a deeper sense of connection in your life, or hosting a dinner for ten in your too-small dining room. Here you’ll find go-to recipes for ricotta custard pancakes, a showstopping roast chicken burnished with saffron, a crunchy, tingly Calabrian chili crisp, super-chewy sky-high focaccia, and a decades-in-the-making, childhood-evoking yellow cake with chocolate frosting. Along the way, you’ll also find plenty of tips, techniques, and lessons, from how to buy olive oil (check the harvest date) to when to splurge (salad dressing is where you want to use your best ingredients) to the best uses for your pressure cooker (chicken stock and dulce de leche, naturally).” “Enjoy 125 meticulously tested, flavor-forward, soul-nourishing recipes that bring joy and a sense of communion.” Film —Looking Through Water Almost immediately, this new film, starring Michael Douglas and his son, reminded me of On Golden Pond where another real-life parent and child take to the screen to tell a familiar story of healing. Looking Through Water will premiere this weekend in select theaters and tells the story of a father’s attempt to reconnect with his estranged son, doing so by inviting him to compete in a father-son fishing competition.” Have a look at the trailer below. Francophile Finds —French Country Crocks New to the shop at Farm House Pottery from Farmhouse Pottery fromVivi et Margot are French Country Crocks drawing inspiration from “the charm of the French countryside blended with Vermont’s artisanal spirit.

Perfect for any kitchen looking to add a touch of rustic beauty, each crock is designed to be a treasured piece in your home, blending form and function for generations to come.” —Van Gogh’s Lover: A Novel by Michael Hetzer I want to first begin by thanking TSLL long-time reader and member Christine for recommending this book to our community. Knowing that art and of course France are frequent subjects of interest, this title is definitely one I think many will enjoy. Released eaerlier this year, Van Gogh’s Lover is inspired by the true story of Vincent Van Gogh’s years in France. The plot begins twelve years after “a high school accident derailed Jane’s once-promising future. When the owners of the powerful Firth Gallery invite Jane to bring her beloved family painting, The Lover, to Switzerland, it looks like a second chance. But on her first night in Geneva, the painting goes missing, and she suspects the Firths.” “Determined to recover her painting, Jane is led to a dying village in the high Alps where an enigmatic man living in a château is waiting for her. Within the château’s walls, she uncovers a history of lies, murder, and, at its heart, an appalling injustice that will shake the art world to its core.” “But not everyone wants these facts brought to light. Jane will need to find the strength she lost in her accident and face the shocking truth about her past, her painting, and, finally, an epic love affair between a destitute painter named Vincent Van Gogh and a mysterious woman who inspired a portrait that may be his greatest work.” Shopping —Banana Republic’s Friends & Family Event, 40% off full priced purchase Beginning today (12th) and running through the 21st, enjoy 40% off any full priced purchase.

Cue the premieres of just about every returning and new show to begin in the days and weeks to come. —High Potential, season 2 (US version) ABC/Hulu Speaking of which, the mystery series adapted from the original French series HPI (Haut Potentiel Intellectuel) – which by the way you can watch on Hulu as well!, is returning for a second season. High Potential premieres Tuesday September 16th on ABC/Hulu. Having watched a the latest season (4th) of the French version (there are five seasons so far – the fifth is being developed right now), I am curious to know if the American version will follow the same storyline for its main characters.

And boy, does it look to be high drama scene after scene! Whoa!

Wednesday evenings are booked! Have a look at the trailer below and enjoy 10 episodes, taking us all the way to middle of November. The rain came, continued to fall, gushed, created temporary ponds in the roads and roundabouts, then Mother Nature gave us a day of sunshine before cuing the rain’s return. As many will have guessed, the happy dances at Le Papillon were in full swing! So happy am I that we are now tuckered as Nelle demonstrates above. But tuckered in a very good way ☺️. With the weather as it was, the encouragement to stay inside after our walks, meant quite a bit of work occurred on the fourth book, and as I put in the last few sections that after two months away from the book this summer, I realized the book would absolutely do well to have, we’re getting close to done. And that feels amazing. 😌 Last weekend a new family member for the garden was planted, a tree I thought I would have to wait until spring to plant, but it sort of plopped into my lap and I couldn’t say no. I will be sure to share exactly what and where it is in the Garden post later this month, and TOP Tier members can look for the monthly Ponderings . . . post to be shared this weekend. We will be talking about all sorts of stuff including the beginning steps on the Guest Bedroom project. Now that the peaches have been made into jam after sharing the rest with the neighbors, weekends shift away from garden projects (although soon, soon! the cottage gate will be installed!) and into home and life projects which coordinates well with the seasonal shift. Wearing my first scarf on a walk this week, the Outfits of the Month post is full of five outfits taking inspiration from the British while we bring on the layers for fall. And on Monday, Part Trois (3) of What Lies at the Heart of Living Simply Luxuriously was shared as we talked about savoring the everyday ‘sides’ of living well.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Adobe (ADBE) just reported record quarterly revenue driven by artificial intelligence gains. Will it revive confidence in the stock? The creative software giant late Thursday posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.31 on revenue that jumped 11% year-over-year to a record $5.99 billion in the fiscal third quarter, above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, as AI revenues topped company targets. CEO Shantanu Narayen said that with the third-quarter's revenue driven by AI, Adobe has already surpassed its "AI-first" revenue goals for the year, leading the company to boost its outlook. The company said it now anticipates full-year adjusted earnings of $20.80 to $20.85 per share and revenue of $23.65 billion to $23.7 billion, up from adjusted earnings of $20.50 to $20.70 on revenue of $23.50 billion to $23.6 billion previously. Shares of Adobe were recently rising in late trading. But they've had a tough year so far, with the stock down more than 20% for 2025 through Thursday's close amid worries about the company's AI progress and growing competition. Wall Street is optimistic. The shares finished Thursday a bit below $351, and the mean price target as tracked by Visible Alpha, above $461, represents a more than 30% premium. Most of the analysts tracking the stock have "buy" ratings. But even that target represents a degree of caution in the context of recent highs. The shares were above $600 in February 2024.

Title: David Ellison shows he's serious about fighting Netflix and Disney for Hollywood's crown

Time Published: 2025-09-11T21:13:39Z
Full Content:
David Ellison just showed he's serious about challenging Netflix and Disney for the Hollywood crown — and he's moving at lightning speed. The media mogul and his new company, Paramount Skydance, are preparing a bid for rival Warner Bros. Discovery, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Business Insider couldn't independently confirm the report. WBD declined to comment, and Paramount didn't respond to requests for comments. The news sent waves through the media industry, in part because of how quickly Ellison seems to be moving to consolidate power. As a reminder, the deal that combined his company, Skydance, with Paramount closed just last month. It helps that Ellison has the financial backing of his father, Larry Ellison, who briefly surpassed Elon Musk as the world's richest person this week. WBD had planned to split into two companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, next year. Paramount is preparing a majority cash bid for the whole company, backed by the Ellison family, the WSJ reported. Together, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery — which owns assets like the Warner Bros. film and TV studios and the HBO Max streaming service — would create a Hollywood titan. "There's absolutely no doubt that a combination of these two companies would result in the deepest roster of blockbuster franchise IP in all of Hollywood," said Brandon Katz, the insights and content strategy director at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics. It would also give Ellison a host of cable TV networks like CNN and some additional sports rights, and create potential antitrust scrutiny. Such a merger would make it clear that Ellison wants to compete with the industry leaders, not just shepherd Paramount into the streaming era. Before this news, Ellison had already hinted at grander ambitions, signing a $7.7 billion UFC deal less than a week after the Paramount-Skydance deal closed. Even with the merger, competing with Netflix and Disney would be an uphill battle. Paramount+ and HBO Max combined would have ranked fifth among streaming services in watchtime on US connected TVs in July, according to Nielsen — behind YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ with Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. "A mash-up of both streaming services would require a very expensive and long technological revamp that isn't guaranteed to spur subscriber growth and slow churn," Katz said. Still, Wall Street is thrilled with the potential combination. On Thursday afternoon, WBD's stock soared as much as 37%, while Paramount shares spiked more than 10%. One reason: potential cost savings. A marriage between two major studios would lead to efficiencies, likely including major layoffs. For Hollywood's creative community, it would mean one fewer buyer, further consolidating Tinseltown. "There's one less green light place in town, which puts pressure on the agents and managers," an advisor close to both companies said. But that one company would also have a lot of money to spend, this person added. On Wednesday at a Goldmach Sachs media conference, WBD CEO David Zaslav predicted the streaming landscape would "rationalize" further, leaving just a few superpowers remaining. "Right now, there's only five global players: there's Amazon, Netflix, Disney, us, and YouTube," Zaslav said. He didn't mention Paramount. With such a deal, Ellison would show he's committed to being one of the entertainment giants left standing. Jump to

The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Shares in the New York-based firm are expected to begin trading Friday, concluding the IPO process that first began when it filed its intentions with the SEC in June. Here’s everything you need to know about the Gemini IPO. More than 16 million shares of GEMI will be offered by the exchange in the price range of $24-26, potentially netting the firm around $433 million in IPO proceeds based on its recent upsized filing. Even at that number, which increased from a previously expected share price range of $17-19, Reuters reported that the firm’s offering was oversubscribed by as much as 20 times. Based on the upper range of the expected share price, Gemini could surpass an initial valuation of $3 billion. Though the firm is offering up 16.67 million shares, it requested that underwriters reserve 10% of the supply—or around 1.67 million shares—for sale through a “directed share program,” which will offer them exclusively to select parties. Gemini is perhaps best known for its co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, early Bitcoin and cryptocurrency believers that vocally and financially supported President Donald Trump in his bid to reclaim the presidency in 2024. They also played a key role in the creation of Facebook, as chronicled in the film “The Social Network.” The firm primarily generates its revenue from trading fees earned via the use of its centralized exchange. According to its IPO filing, nearly 70% of the firm’s revenue was earned in this manner during 2024. Last year, the firm generated $142.2 million in revenue, yet sustained a net income loss of $158.5 million. Through the first six months of this year, the firm’s percentage of trading fee revenue dipped to 65.5%, pulling in total revenue of $68.6 million. That puts it on track to finish just below last year’s revenue number. In the same timeframe, the firm generated a net income loss of $282.5 million. Despite the sagging income numbers, the firm remains optimistic about its future. Gemini wrote in its filing that based on its “focus on innovation and a long history of firsts in the crypto industry, we believe our products and services can fulfill the needs of our ever-expanding user base, including as traditional financial market participants enter the space.” Gemini’s intentions to go public came shortly after the massively successful IPO of stablecoin issuer, Circle. Like Gemini, Circle upsized its IPO and still more than tripled the offering price on the first day of trading, outperforming public launches from tech giants like Meta and Airbnb in the process. Since Circle’s IPO, crypto exchanges like Kraken and Gemini filed their intentions to go public. Crypto exchange Bullish also recently completed its IPO, similarly screaming out of the gate and tripling after hitting the market. American Bitcoin, the BTC mining firm co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, also surged after its recent launch. On Thursday, crypto lender Figure raised more than $787 million in its IPO, ultimately notching a valuation of $5.29 billion. Shares jumped more than 24% from the IPO price once they hit the market for trading. As barriers to entry for buying and selling cryptocurrency have decreased, centralized exchanges like Gemini and rivals Coinbase and Binance have become increasingly competitive in trying to acquire and maintain users. Based on its filing, Gemini is hoping to increase both its monthly transacting users and the average daily trading volume of those users. It aims to do so via expanding its product suite, expanding internationally, and growing its derivative offerings—and a big chunk of IPO cash could help it accomplish those goals.

September 11, 2025 15:36 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Watch These Broadcom Price Levels After Stock's Recent Rally on AI Optimism
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-broadcom-price-levels-after-stock-recent-rally-on-ai-optimism-11807888
Time Published: 2025-09-11T19:02:49Z
Full Content:
Broadcom (AVGO) shares rallied to an all-time high this week as the chipmaker positions itself as a key competitor to AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The stock surged nearly 10% to a record close near $370 Wednesday, before pulling back slightly in Thursday's session. They've added more than half their value since the start of the year, with a close to 20% gain over the past five days alone, boosted by the company’s strong quarterly results, a new $10 billion customer, and the resurgence of the AI trade after Oracle (ORCL) reported a massive increase in its backlog. In a note to clients on Monday, Melius Research analysts said they expect Broadcom could gain about 30% of the AI compute market, while Nvidia’s market share falls over time. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels to watch after the stock’s recent bullish run. After retracing just below the 50-week moving average in March, Broadcom shares have staged an impressive reversal, with gains accelerating recently after the chipmaker’s quarterly results. While above-average trading volume has signaled buying conviction, the relative strength index warns of overbought conditions, with the indicator reaching a level that preceded major consolidation phases in the stock during late 2021 and mid-2023. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast how a long-term uptrend for Broadcom could play out, and also identify support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can use bars pattern analysis to project a potential bullish price target and speculate how high the stock could go from here. When applying the technique to Broadcom’s chart, we take the stock’s uptrend from May 2023 to June 2024 and overlay it from the start of last week’s bullish move. This indicates a period of consolidation for several months before a possible rally toward $680 by October next year, if price action rhymes with the prior trend. The earlier trend began with two weekly price bars that delivered a combined gain of 27%, compared to the over 20% cumulative advance of the two most recent weekly bars. During potential pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth tracking the $250 level. This area on the chart may provide support near the stock’s December and January twin peaks. Selling below this level could see the Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $185. Investors may seek entry points in this location near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between June and November last year.

Title: Watch These Broadcom Price Levels After Stock's Recent Rally on AI Optimism

Broadcom (AVGO) shares rallied to an all-time high this week as the chipmaker positions itself as a key competitor to AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The stock surged nearly 10% to a record close near $370 Wednesday, before pulling back slightly in Thursday's session. They've added more than half their value since the start of the year, with a close to 20% gain over the past five days alone, boosted by the company’s strong quarterly results, a new $10 billion customer, and the resurgence of the AI trade after Oracle (ORCL) reported a massive increase in its backlog. In a note to clients on Monday, Melius Research analysts said they expect Broadcom could gain about 30% of the AI compute market, while Nvidia’s market share falls over time. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels to watch after the stock’s recent bullish run. After retracing just below the 50-week moving average in March, Broadcom shares have staged an impressive reversal, with gains accelerating recently after the chipmaker’s quarterly results. While above-average trading volume has signaled buying conviction, the relative strength index warns of overbought conditions, with the indicator reaching a level that preceded major consolidation phases in the stock during late 2021 and mid-2023.

Title: You can still buy Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses for $76 off - here are the deals

Meta Ray-Bans have often been very difficult to find in stock at both retailers and online stores for the past two years -- and they rarely go on sale. But one of the best ways to not only get a 20% discount but also find some of the styles that have been discontinued or are rarely ever in stock is to use the little-known Meta Refurbished AI Glasses online store. I recently ordered a pair of Meta Ray-Bans in the Skylar style with the Shiny Caramel finish with Polar Brown lenses. If you've followed Meta Ray-Bans, then you've probably seen these before because they are in a lot of the Meta promotional materials. The frames themselves are semi-transparent, so you can see a lot of the technology inside. And the lenses have that amber tint that's popular in lots of sunglasses because it gives the world a bit of warm orange glow. I was able to buy these for $263, even though they normally retail for $329. Other configurations, like the black with blue transition lenses, were as much as $76 off. As of the writing of this article, Meta's refurbished store was selling the Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler styles. The Wayfarer is the most common style, while the Headliner and Skyler can be more difficult to find. Also: 5 Meta Ray-Ban upgrades I want to see on September 17 When my transparent brown Meta Ray-Bans arrived, they were in the original box and it was unopened, with the perforated pull tag still in perfect condition -- no different than the box of the original pair of black Meta Ray-Bans I bought when the product first launched two years ago. When I opened the box, everything was in perfect order, just like a new pair. All the accessories, booklets, polishing cloth, and even the paper protectors over the arms of the glasses were just as they are in the packaging of a brand-new pair of Meta Ray-Bans that you'd buy at retail or online. Also: I tried Meta's new Oakley smart glasses in my production studio - my verdict as a content creator I pulled the little protective tab inside the case to activate charging and plugged the case into a USB. After about 30 minutes, I opened the Meta AI app, tapped the glasses button on the far right, hit the plus sign in the upper right corner, and tapped on the Ray-Ban | Meta button. The software immediately recognized that a pair of glasses was in a case nearby. I accepted the prompt and tapped through the menus. I pulled the glasses out of the case and examined them, and they were in perfect condition. I put them on and immediately started using them like the other pairs of Meta Ray-Bans I've been testing and using for the past couple of years. So if these are just like new and sold at a discount, then what does it mean when you buy a refurbished tech product? These are typically products that have been lightly used and a customer returned or traded in for another product, or that originally had small defects. They go back to the manufacturer for inspection, cleaning, repair (if needed), and another round of quality assurance. Also: I tried smart glasses with a built-in display, and they beat my Meta Ray-Bans in key ways They are then repacked, often in the same original packaging as new products. However, both the US and the European Union have regulations that require refurbished products to be marked and sold as refurbished, and can't be passed off as new products. That's why they are typically discounted, even though in many cases they are as good as new. In the case of refurbished Meta Ray-Bans, when you buy through the Meta Refurbished AI Glasses online store, then Meta offers a 30-day return policy and a 1-year warranty. Based on my experience, I have no problem recommending that you buy a refurbished pair of these smart glasses, if one of the styles you like is available. Keep in mind that Meta is likely to unveil its next-generation Meta Ray-Bans Smart Glasses on September 17 at its Meta Connect event. These could have new features like longer battery life and better cameras -- two of the items on my wish list. It's unclear if they will be more expensive, but it appears possible if they are integrating better technology, and there's also the uncertain US tariff situation that could impact the cost of parts. The recently released Oakley Meta Smart Glasses have some nice tech upgrades and retail for $400-$500. That could be an indication of where the prices of the new Meta Ray-Bans are going to land. If that's the case, the deal on these refurbished Meta Ray-Bans could look even better.

September 11, 2025 13:48 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. 2025 might just be the year of Oracle. The 48-year-old tech company’s stock value has doubled year-to-date, and just in the last week, soared by over 30% off the heels of a bullish earnings report. Oracle’s market cap is now valued over $920 billion—higher than that of Walmart and JPMorgan Chase. This substantial stock performance has boosted the wealth of Oracle’s investors, namely Larry Ellison. As the company’s founder, chairman, and chief technology officer, his wealth has grown to over $350 billion, putting him neck-and-neck with Elon Musk as the world’s richest person. But it’s not just Ellison who’s been owed all the credit—or the award. Oracle’s CEO Safra Catz has been at the helm of the company for over a decade, and her wealth jumped by over $400 million in just six hours on Wednesday to $3.4 billion, according to Forbes. “Clearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads,” Catz said during Tuesday’s earnings call. “We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who’s who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia, AMD and many others.” Catz’s leadership successes at Oracle have cemented her as one of the richest self-made women in the world, having climbed the ladder first on Wall Street as an investment banker before heading to Silicon Valley to join Oracle (the tech firm later moved to Austin in 2020). And part of what has helped drive the tech company to succeed is her mantra to always be the best. “We don’t want to follow others. We always try to do something differently,” she told CNBC earlier this year. “Being No. 1 is very, very important. It also means you’re the best and solving customers’ needs. On the surface level, Oracle’s recent stock success is somewhat head-scratching. The company has been around for over four decades, and other big-name tech companies, such as IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon, have made the cloud services market more crowded than ever. Moreover, during Tuesday’s earnings report, Oracle announced it actually had slightly missed earnings and revenue projections. However, investors have been more impressed with what Oracle has coming down the pipeline, namely its plan to 14x its cloud infrastructure revenue. By fiscal year 2030, its cloud infrastructure revenue will be $144 billion—up from fiscal year 2025’s $10.3 billion. Just this week, OpenAI signed a $300 billion cloud contract with Oracle for the construction of data centers over the next five years, according to The New York Times. As the roughly 41% stakeholder in Oracle, Ellison has reaped the greatest benefits from his tech company’s 450% share price growth over the last five years. The 81-year-old also has gained substantial wealth from previous involvement in Tesla, as well as now owning close to 50% in Paramount Skydance. Catz too owes her billionaire status to Oracle. Although her base salary is $950,000, the majority of her wealth is connected to the market. She maintains about 1.1 million in shares but regularly receives and exercises stock options; earlier this year, she sold stock options worth some $1.8 billion, according to Bloomberg. Fortune reached out to Oracle for comment. Catz is a double graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, having gone to law school shortly after graduating with a business-focused bachelor’s degree. And even though she ultimately decided to forgo a career in law, she has no regrets. “My best decision was to choose to go to Wall Street over law. I learned a lot and focused on the expanding software industry at a time when the independent software industry was just beginning,” she told Time in 2010. “That ultimately brought me to Oracle.” And as a leader, one of her core principles is always keeping an open mind. “Listen, think and don’t be afraid to change your position based on new facts,” she told Fortune in 2015 after being asked the biggest leadership lesson she’d learned over the past year. The then-newly minted co-CEO of Oracle added that employees deserve to be heard out in every meeting. “If something doesn’t make sense, give them the respect of asking tough questions,” she said. “Think about what you’ve been told because if it doesn’t make sense to you, then it may not make sense at all. But, then again, they just might be right.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Nvidia has finally won over one of its biggest Wall Street bears

Time Published: 2025-09-11T14:31:25Z
Full Content:
It seems that Nvidia's success is too great for one of Wall Street's biggest bears to ignore. In an update to clients, DA Davidson raised its rating on Nvidia stock from "neutral" to "buy" and raised its price target from $195 to $210 a share. That implies around 18% upside from current levels. It also reflects a sharp change in sentiment from what the firm has previously said about the stock, with analysts predicting as much as a 48% drop in March. "Our increasingly optimistic view of the growth in AI compute demand supersedes our list of concerns regarding NVDA," analysts led by Gil Luria, the firm's head of technology research, wrote. In the past, Luria and his team warned that spending from hyperscalers—mega-cap tech firms that are shelling out billions to further their AI ambitions—could peak in 2026, which could significantly impact Nvidia's business. The use cases for AI also need to be more significant to justify how much money comapnies are pouring into Nvidia, they added. But things have changed over the last six months. In a note shortly after Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report, Luria said the firm's perspective on the stock had "shifted quite a bit" over the past half-year, thanks to the rapid development and adoption of AI among companies. Hyperscaler spending, meanwhile, doesn't look to be nearing a peak. "It does mean that the most important thing—the overwhelming growth in demand for compute—is the only thing that matters," Luria and other analysts wrote. "NVIDIA should be able to sustain growth over the next two years, regardless of which segment that growth comes from," he added. The majority of Wall Street analysts have issued "buy" ratings on Nvidia, even considering the stock's record-breaking run-up over the last several years. The AI chipmaker is up 32% year-to-date. Luria's team, though, said they would continue to keep an eye on several "cross-currents" they saw potentially working against the stock. Here are some of the factors on their radar: Jump to

Title: AST SpaceMobile Jabs SpaceX for Overloading Earth's Orbit With Satellites

SpaceX's approach to satellite cellular connectivity is facing criticism from rival AST SpaceMobile, which claims it can achieve the same results without flooding Earth’s orbit with “thousands” of satellites. Texas-based AST threw the subtle shade in a Tuesday post that touted its “commitment to responsible space operations,” which includes keeping the skies clear of satellite debris. The company didn’t name SpaceX, but it did allude to the home broadband-focused Starlink constellation, which currently spans over 8,000 satellites and could one day reach 30,000, if SpaceX receives regulatory approval. In contrast, AST says its own satellite system promises to be a leaner alternative. “This approach is remarkably efficient: with our large, powerful satellites, we can achieve global coverage with approximately 90 satellites — not thousands or even tens of thousands required by other systems,” the post said. "Beyond launching significantly fewer satellites overall, we are committed to minimizing our footprint in space through every aspect of design and operation," AST adds. SpaceX has been critical of AST’s upcoming next-generation BlueBird satellites, calling them out as "tennis-court-sized" spacecraft that threaten to upend orbital safety. The FCC is reviewing the company’s application to operate a satellite cellular service for phones in the US. If all goes well, AST will cross a crucial threshold and receive clearance to operate a constellation up to 248 satellites in size. But the same process also involves collecting public comments, including from competitors, forcing AST to answer and possibly defend its approach. That’s probably why AST’s post offers an overview of the company’s efforts to make its proposed satellite constellation safe and reliable. This includes ongoing agreements and collaborations with the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the International Astronautical Union to protect the Earth’s orbital environment and reduce the potential brightness of the satellites — something SpaceX has also been working on for Starlink. AST and SpaceX are competing to lead in the emerging market of satellite connectivity for smartphones. But SpaceX already has a significant head start. Its cellular Starlink system, which spans over 650 satellites, has already been delivering service through T-Mobile's T-Satellite add-on plan, including support for text messages and even satellite data for mobile apps. This week, Elon Musk's company also reached a $17 billion deal to acquire spectrum from Boost Mobile’s parent company, EchoStar, which promises to take the cellular Starlink service to the next level, making it comparable to a ground-based 4G service, according to SpaceX. Still, the company needs at least two years before it can begin utilizing the spectrum for commercial use since it’ll require smartphone vendors to update their products with chips capable of communicating over the additional radio bands. Meanwhile, AST is facing questions over whether it can launch enough satellites in time to begin offering the service through partners AT&T and Verizon by next year. The company currently only has five BlueBird satellites in orbit, when it needs between 45 and 60 to offer continuous service across the US. However, AST’s prototype second-generation BlueBird satellite, FM1, might not launch until December or January, when it was previously planned for August. Still, AST's CEO last month said that his company has "planned orbital launches every one to two months on average during 2025 and 2026. ... And we are on target to complete 40 satellites equivalent of microns by early 2026 to support full voice, data, and video space-based cellular broadband services.” My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Use these Alexa commands to manage your life without lifting a finger. These voice commands make Alexa the ultimate sidekick. Alexa has evolved far beyond its origins as a simple voice assistant for setting reminders and playing music. After 11 years, it finally got a significant upgrade with the introduction of Alexa Plus. This new iteration is powered by advanced AI, making the assistant smarter, more conversational, and, for the first time, proactive. With Alexa Plus, the assistant can manage your smart devices, organize a dynamic calendar, control your Fire TV, and even follow you from one speaker to another as you move through your home. This deeper integration makes for a more seamless user experience. If you haven't used Alexa in a while, its new commands are designed to keep up with the demands of a busy life. This CNET survey found that 73% of US adults who use voice assistants still have privacy concerns with AI features, but Alexa was rated the most trusted option among them. If you own an Echo device, learning the right commands is the key to unlocking everything Alexa can do. Here's a full guide to the best ones to start with. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

The domestic wood panel industry is gearing up for a robust revival, driven by a surge in housing handovers, large-scale capacity expansions and easing timber prices, said analysts. Shares such as Greenply Industries, Century Plyboard, Greenpanel, Greenlam Industries, Archidply Industries and Rushil Decor gained sharply in today’s trade. In the three months, these stocks have generated handsome returns between 3 and 29 per cent. While plywood remains the dominant category, Medium-Density Fibreboard (MDF) is witnessing rapid adoption, especially in commercial and OEM segments. MDF demand grew at a 22 per cent CAGR during FY21-FY25, said Yes Securities, expecting this momentum to continue as pricing stabilises and margins recover. In Q1FY26, wood panel companies reported modest operating performances. “Plywood segment exhibited mixed volume growth, but OPM was subdued y-o-y. MDF segment saw muted volume growth (except CPBI) and operating margins continued to be mixed across companies, said ICICI Securities. According to analysts, operating margins should stay healthy in the plywood segment as timber prices have stabilised. Besides, the government is taking steps to ensure BIS on furniture by February 26. While the import inventory has also died down, there is still competition for pricing from the unorganised players. This, combined with the softening of timber prices, will act as a tailwind for the plywood business, said Axis Securities.. Yes Securities, in a recent thematic report, said the sector is entering a multi-year upcycle, with top players like Century Plyboards and Greenply Industries expected to lead the charge. India’s real estate market has seen a massive presales boom over the past four years, with a significant portion of inventory now entering the handover phase. The average area of homes scheduled for delivery between 2024 and 2029 is nearly double that of the previous decade, implying higher interior spends and increased demand for furniture — a key driver for woodpanel consumption. “The MDF industry has faced oversupply challenges in recent years, creating pricing pressure and materially impacting margins. However, with most large capacity expansions already commissioned and demand growth likely to sustain, utilisation levels should improve, aiding margin recovery. Furthermore, the imposition of anti-dumping duty has curbed imports substantially, and the existing inventory of low-cost imports is nearing exhaustion. Consequently, we expect improvement in the overall scenario for MDFs hereon,” the Yes Securities’ report noted. Top listed players have invested over ₹5,000 crore in capacity expansion across plywood, MDF, laminates and particle boards. With major capex behind them and demand set to rise, analysts anticipate a strong earnings trajectory. On the cost side, timber prices, which account for up to 65 per cent of raw material costs, are showing signs of cooling after an 18-24 month rally. This should aid margin recovery across companies. With timber prices showing signs of cooling and anti-dumping duties curbing cheap imports, the woodpanel sector is set for margin expansion. Analysts highlight that PEG ratios for top players are below 1x, indicating attractive valuations relative to growth. As the housing handover cycle accelerates and furniture demand rises, investors may find compelling opportunities in select woodpanel stocks — especially those with diversified portfolios and completed capex cycles. With furniture demand rising and capacity in place, brokerages see woodpanel companies entering a margin-accretive earnings cycle. Analysts prefer diversified players like CPBI and Greenply for re-rating potential, while niche MDF player Greenpanel may see steady but limited upside.

NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NVO) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 30, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Forbes Daily: What’s Behind Larry Ellison’s Unprecedented Wealth Surge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2025/09/11/forbes-daily-whats-behind-larry-ellisons-unprecedented-wealth-surge/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T11:58:59Z

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Larry Ellison is coming for Elon Musk’s crown as the world’s richest person. The Oracle chairman became nearly $100 billion richer Wednesday—the biggest single-day gain ever—as shares of the cloud computing giant rallied. Ellison briefly became the second-ever person to cross the $400 billion mark, before falling back down to $388 billion by late afternoon. Oracle’s stock surged 36%, largely on the company’s projection that cloud infrastructure revenue, primarily to power AI, will skyrocket. There’s a key reason Ellison benefits so much from Oracle’s gain: stock buybacks, which the company has spent $142 billion on since 2011. As a result, Ellison’s stake nearly doubled to 41% in that time. Conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA Charlie Kirk died at age 31 on Wednesday after he was shot at an event at Utah Valley University. Kirk was a prominent voice in culture wars on college campuses and hosted a popular daily radio show and podcast. Utah and federal law enforcement authorities are still searching for the shooter as of Thursday morning, after two people were detained and later released. MORE: The fatal shooting drew bipartisan condemnation from lawmakers and public figures, with President Donald Trump saying that nobody “understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Kirk,” while California Governor Gavin Newsom said the killing was “sick and reprehensible,” adding that he admired Kirk’s “passion and commitment to debate.” The buy-now, pay-later hype has made its way to Wall Street, as Swedish firm Klarna surged in its IPO on Wednesday. The company, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $52, up 30% from its IPO price, is the first of three high-profile fintech firms aiming to go public this week. In a surprisingly positive development in the fight against inflation, wholesale prices fell in August after Wall Street expected an increase, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In a note, Comerica Bank’s chief economist Bill Adams said wholesalers and retailers have been “slow to pass on the costs of tariffs” to consumers—but President Donald Trump celebrated the report while reiterating calls for the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates. Melinda French Gates announced Wednesday at the Forbes Power Women’s Summit that she is backing a $100 million partnership to address women’s health, targeting long-underfunded research on conditions like cardiovascular disease, women’s mental health and autoimmune disorders. The need is clear: Just 1% of global health research beyond cancer focuses on conditions unique to women. The succession battle over the future of FOX and News Corp came to an end this week, and 94-year-old Rupert Murdoch’s wish to leave control of the trust that holds his family’s $8.1 billion combined stake in the two media giants to his son, Lachlan, will be fulfilled. Lachlan’s two siblings, Elisabeth and James Murdoch, and his oldest half-sibling, Prudence MacLeod, will be bought out—which should let them each walk away with about $1.4 billion. Jared Kushner’s brother Josh has been one of the most active investors in AI through his firm Thrive Capital, and now Jared is getting in on the action by cofounding AI startup Brain Co. The firm, which aims to help big corporations and governments use AI to improve their operations, announced Wednesday it had emerged from stealth and raised $30 million in its Series A funding round. South Korean nationals who were detained after a raid on a Hyundai plant in Georgia last week were released early on Thursday, a day later than initially planned, as South Korean officials claimed that President Donald Trump “wanted to explore whether they could stay in the U.S. to continue working and training American workers.” However, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun turned down the offer, saying the detained individuals were “extremely shocked and exhausted.” As ICE ramps up for an agent hiring surge, the agency has acquired a slew of new armor, drones and weaponry, records show. The military-grade gear ranges from Glock handguns to an AI-powered drone for “surveillance,” as the Trump Administration has promised to carry out more mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. The U.S. job market just got a big rewrite. On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than previously thought—the largest downward revision on record. The timing isn’t ideal, as the agency itself has been under fire. President Donald Trump accused former commissioner Erika McEntarfer of manipulating data during the 2024 election and has said the BLS “rigged” its numbers. He replaced her with Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni, a move Democrats condemned. But the explanation for the correction has to do with small businesses. Nonfarm payrolls (the proper name for the official monthly jobs number) aren’t an actual count of every worker. It’s a survey of employers. The BLS asks firms how many people are on their payrolls. The survey then gets adjusted to try to capture the parts of the labor market the survey misses. Introduced in 2003, the birth-death model uses historical patterns to estimate how many new firms are likely opening or closing each month. It works well in normal times. But not all times are normal. And for the last two years, it has looked out of step with reality. Census Bureau data show that before 2020, Americans were filing about 300,000 new business applications a month. The number was steady for years, but then the pandemic hit. Since then, filings have averaged more than 400,000 a month. Some months have been higher. People want to work from home, and more are willing to try entrepreneurship. New tools, including AI, make it easier to start. WHY IT MATTERS “The jobs report is one of the most watched economic indicators,” says Forbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin. “Big revisions shake confidence in the numbers and can move markets. They also provide fodder for political fights. Understanding what drives the revisions can help you make sense of the noise.” MORE Forget BLS. Here’s How To Take The Economy’s Temperature Without Using Government Data Amazon’s robotaxi unit Zoox is now offering free rides to the public in Las Vegas, as it aims to compete with the autonomous ride-hail service from Alphabet’s Waymo. It’s a big step for the company, which was acquired by Amazon in 2020: Five: The number of locations around the city that Zoox vehicles will pick up and drop off passengers $1.2 billion: The price Amazon paid to acquire Zoox The end of 2024: When Zoox started building up its fleet of robotaxis at a 220,000-square-foot factory in California As the job market continues to weaken, young people are feeling the effects the most. But to stand out in a crowded field, consider skipping LinkedIn and instead opt for the niche job boards where recruiters actually hunt. Rewrite your résumé for each role, and be sure to share your salary expectations with prospective employers up front—especially if you’re short on time. Uber will offer a few unconventional rides starting next year after its acquisition of a firm for $125 million. Which of the following is one of the types of vehicles that users will be able to ride in? A. Boat B. Seaplane C. Motorcycle D. Bus Check your answer. Thanks for reading!

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is little changed. Oil and gold futures both are lower. The Consumer Price Index is expected to show that the inflation rate moved higher in August when that report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal project that the CPI report will show that prices in August rose by 2.9% over the past 12 months, up from 2.7% in July. That would mark the highest annual inflation rate since January. Yesterday, the Producer Price Index reading for August ticked 0.1% lower when a rise of 0.3% was expected. The CPI report will be closely watched by Federal Reserve officials, who are considering lowering interest rates at the central bank's meeting next week. Oracle (ORCL) shares are rising a further 2% in premarket trading after soaring 36% Wednesday—their best day since 1992. The stock's blistering gains on strong AI demand has analysts racing to raise their price targets—with most expecting its record run isn't over yet. Oracle also was supported by a The Wall Street Journal report that OpenAI had contracted the company for $300 billion in cloud services over the next five years. Shares of buy now, pay later firm Klarna (KLAR) are pulling back somewhat in premarket trading, a day after jumping nearly 15% in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Klarna shares opened trading yesterday at $52, well above their their initial public offering price of $40, and rose above $57 before closing at $45.82, giving the company a market capitalization of more than $17 billion. Klarna shares were down 2% about 90 minutes before the opening bell. Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) shares are soaring about 35% in premarket trading after the online housing platform tapped Kaz Nejatian, the chief operating officer at Shopify (SHOP), to be its new CEO. The company also said co-founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu would be returning to the board, effective immediately, with Rabois taking on the role of chairman. Opendoor shares have surged since July as retail investors have piled into the meme stock. Opendoor shares ended June trading at $0.53 each but entered Thursday at $5.86.

Title: The Everyday Investor’s Report For Thursday, September 11

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Stock prices dipped slightly in trading Wednesday after Oracle reported an upbeat outlook for cloud revenue and the Producer Price Index revealed a decline in wholesale prices in August. The S&P 500 fell 0.28% after the opening bell Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.43% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.53%. Technology company Oracle reported earnings after the close of trading Tuesday. The headlining takeaway was the company’s expectation of generating $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in fiscal 2030, up from an expected $18 billion this fiscal year. Oracle’s cloud revenue has benefited from the AI build out. The ample projection suggests there’s still momentum in AI stocks. The Producer Price Index, known as the PPI, declined 0.1% in August after rising 0.7% in July. The Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% as expected. Investors are watching pricing data closely. Higher-than-expected increases could influence when and how quickly the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. The Fed’s next interest-rate decision will be announced on September 17. Stock futures are slightly up of the market open on Thursday. Futures tracking the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. Contracts tied to the technology-focused Nasdaq 100 rose 0.27%. And Dow Jones futures rose 0.19%. Events on the calendar for September 11 that could influence stock prices include: What’s your investing goal? Having a defined investing goal helps you make better trading decisions. Knowing the goal helps you understand the timeline and influences the level of risk you should accept. Consider two common investing goals: investing to fund a comfortable retirement and investing to pay for your kid’s college education. Both goals have a timeline and personal level of significance. For example, you may hope to retire at age 55—but you’re willing to wait until age 60 to maintain a specific lifestyle. Or perhaps you intend to save enough to fund a private university education for your kid, and you view that goal as non-negotiable. These parameters should affect how much you invest, the types of investments you buy and the decisions you make during tough market cycles. Your approach to retirement saving or college funding should differ from an approach designed to create gains as quickly as possible. Why? Because you can’t afford to lose your nest egg or your kid’s college funding. So, figure out why you’re investing and evaluate your trading impulses against the goal. Ask yourself: will this trade serve the goal? This one habit can improve your results significantly over time.

Title: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison’s ability to secure Nvidia GPUs has made it the cloud contender it never was and allowed Ellison to briefly surpass Elon Musk as the world’s richest man

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. It’s Jeremy here, filling in for Andrew, who is now on paternity leave for a bit. So you’ll see a rotating cast of Fortune tech journalists writing this newsletter for a few weeks. Fortune Brainstorm Tech wrapped yesterday. Here were a few highlights from the final day of the conference: Meanwhile, the tech world is talking about Oracle’s massive market gains, which have boosted Oracle founder, chairman, and chief technology officer Larry Ellison’s net worth, allowing him to surpass Elon Musk to claim the title of world’s richest man. Helping to drive Oracle’s stock was the announcement of a massive $300 billion deal with OpenAI to supply the AI company with data center capacity. (Now we know why OpenAI is telling investors it’s going to burn through $115 billion in cash by 2029.) Of course, the only reason Oracle is in this position is down to Ellison’s courting of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, which has allowed his company, previously a distinct back-of-the-pack cloud company, to secure a massive stockpile of top-of-the-line Nvidia GPUs. More on Ellison’s soaring fortunes below. Buy-now, pay-later fintech Klarna’s IPO went off, with the company’s shares gaining 15% on opening day. (Whether that “opening day pop” is a good thing is a debate for another day. It seems like the finance profs have mostly lost the argument, with bankers convincing companies that the money lost from underpricing the shares is worth its weight in marketing and investor buzz from the opening day jump.) Beatrice Nolan has more too on Sam Altman’s sit down with conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson. While Altman said a number of interesting things—most of which he has said before—the real news was the fact that Atlman felt the need to do Carlson’s podcast in the first place. Clearly OpenAI has seen reports that the MAGA crowd is unhappy with President Donald Trump’s cozy relationship with Silicon Valley’s biggest players and is hoping to win them over. The MAGA wing of the Republican Party views AI companies with at best skepticism and at worst, downright disdain, seeing them as woke bastions of left wing coastal elitism, exemplars of Silicon Valley’s inordinate, insidious, and arbitrary power, and, in their quest to build AGI and “superintelligence,” guilty of a kind of idolatry (essentially trying to build God in a machine). You can watch Carlson press Altman on these points throughout the podcast, while Altman tries, often awkwardly, to parry the premise of Carlson’s questions, or assure Carlson that there’s really not as much ideological distance between them as Carlson seems to assume. It’s all slightly cringey (especially Carlson’s over-the-top facial expressions). But, despite the cringe factor, it is probably worth watching, if only to get a deeper sense of the reasons MAGA distrusts Silicon Valley in general and AI in particular. Ok, now here’s more tech news. —Jeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Oracle’s revenue projections sent the stock, and Ellison’s net worth, soaring on Wednesday. It was bad news for old friend Elon Musk, though, whose nearly year-long reign as the world’s richest man came to a brief end. (Oracle stock pulled back a bit before the close, allowing Musk to regain the title.) Oracle’s strong quarterly results added a whopping $101 billion to Ellison’s wealth at one point, boosting his fortune to $393 billion and leapfrogging above Musk’s $385 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. The staggering increase was the largest one-day increase ever recorded by the index. Oracle stock surged 36% on Wednesday—the company’s biggest one-day increase ever—after executives reported blowout bookings and gave a bullish cloud outlook. The rally adds to the 45% gain the company already notched up this year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the majority of the new revenue will come from OpenAI, which signed a staggering $300B cloud agreement with Oracle. The AI firm will tap Oracle’s computing infrastructure under the billion dollar deal, which is one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. The commitment far exceeds OpenAI’s current revenue. Oracle’s revenue projections shocked analysts, who told CNBC they were “blown away” and “all kind of in shock.” Some, however, are urging caution, warning the unprecedented success has made the stock overvalued. —Beatrice Nolan The pair also discussed OpenAI cofounder Elon Musk, with Altman saying he now “feels differently” about the man he once saw as an “incredible hero.” Perhaps it's because of the lawsuits, or the X spats. In one tense moment, when the pair discussed OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji’s death, Altman asked if Carlson was accusing him of murder after the podcast host declared the death, which authorities have ruled as a suicide, “definitely murder.” "I haven't done too many interviews where I have been accused of murder,” Altman said. —Beatrice Nolan Microsoft is cracking down on its hybrid work policy. The tech giant is mandating a minimum of three in-office days a week for employees beginning February 2026, according to a Business Insider report. The policy will first apply to Seattle-area staff, later expanding nationwide and globally. Workers have until Sept. 19 to request exceptions. Microsoft rolled out a flexible work policy after offices reopened from pandemic closures where employees were permitted to work from home up to half the time without official approval. This move follows similar steps from Big Tech rivals including Meta and Google, which already enforce similar RTO rules. The stricter approach comes as the company increases pressure on employees, reshaping performance expectations in an effort to prepare for the next phase of AI-driven growth. Staff in Microsoft’s AI division, led by DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, will face an even stricter requirement: four days a week on site starting January 2026, with exceptions only granted at the highest levels. —Beatrice Nolan Klarna climbed 15% in its Wednesday trading debut. The Swedish-born fintech shares closed at $45.82, 15% above the $40 offer price. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski framed the listing as proof Klarna is moving beyond buy-now, pay-later into broader banking products, even if the company’s value has dropped well below its 2021 peak. The closing price values the company at over $17 billion based on its outstanding shares, with stock options and warrants adding slightly to that figure. The company’s debut also made dozens of staffers millionaires, and its cofounders billionaires. The listing arrives amid a resurgence in the IPO market, which has been under pressure, with companies including Figma debuting with strong performances. Klarna’s debut didn’t quite make the same splash as Figma’s in July, which saw the stock more than triple from its offer price. —Beatrice Nolan —Meta and TikTok score a win against EU tech fees. But won’t receive any money back while officials reformulate the levy. —Apple’s new AI guidelines are Trump-friendly. The company marked DEI as a “controversial” topic. —Reddit removes subscriber counts from subreddits. The platform will switch to displaying weekly active visitors. —Amazon-owned Zoox launches public service in Las Vegas.

Title: How The 10 Richest American Hedge Fund Managers Got $20 Billion Richer In A Year

ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Most hedge funds have lagged behind the AI-fueled stock market surge of the past three years, opting for lower-risk investments. But that hasn’t stopped investor money from clamoring to get access to the top firms—or investment gains and carried interest from adding billions to their billionaire owners’ pockets. The 10 richest hedge fund managers on this year’s Forbes 400 ranking of the country’s richest people are worth a combined $174 billion, up $20 billion from a year ago. Citadel’s Ken Griffin was the biggest gainer by far, with his fortune swelling by more than $7 billion to an estimated $50.4 billion, widening Griffin’s lead over the rest of the pack. The next three richest hedge fund managers in the U.S.—David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Steve Cohen of Point72 and Israel Englander of Millennium Management—only added about $3 billion to their fortunes on average over the same span. Each of these four investors generated double-digit net returns in 2024, outperforming the 6.2% return of the HFRI 500 Fund Weighted Composite Index, which tracks the largest hedge funds that are open to new investments. That hedge fund index’s three-year average annual return through the first half of 2025 is a meager 4.6%, trounced by the S&P 500’s annualized return of 16% over that same period. Against that lackluster competition, the best of the best can charge higher fees without driving their investors away. Citadel, Millennium, Point72 and others all have implemented or expanded so-called passthrough fee arrangements in recent years that have shifted more operating costs to investors, beyond the standard 2% management fee that has long been a hedge fund staple. The top firms have staffs of several thousand employees who are expensive but have proven worthwhile. The annualized return for Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund from 1990 through 2024 is 19.5%, after fees. Millennium’s net annualized return since inception in 1989, meanwhile, is 14%, with only one down year, in 2008. Most of these top firms are largely closed to new investors, and habitually return profits to existing limited partners, in order to stay lean enough to sustain their performance. But they’ve spawned plenty of imitators, with Hedge Fund Research reporting that net inflows into hedge funds in the second quarter this year amounted to $25 billion, representing the highest quarterly net asset inflow in 11 years. Still, the gap between the upstarts and the most technologically advanced multistrategy firms is widening. Citadel, D.E. Shaw and Millennium generated $29.5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, amounting to more than 10% of the net $289 billion in gains all hedge fund managers produced. The founders of these firms have long been mainstays on The Forbes 400. Citadel has become the envy of the hedge fund world, managing $68 billion in assets, but an even larger piece of Griffin’s net worth comes from his majority ownership stake in Citadel Securities, a separate market-making firm that booked $9.7 billion in net trading revenue last year. He used some of the profits to add to his collection of homes and toys, spending $45 million on fellow Forbes 400 member Julia Koch’s Park Avenue co-op this February and $18 million on rare copies of the Emancipation Proclamation and 13th Amendment signed by Abraham Lincoln. He intends to loan those documents for public display ahead of the United States’ 250th birthday festivities next year. Tepper’s personal capital makes up the majority of Appaloosa’s $17 billion in assets under management. The largest position in the fund’s stock portfolio as of the end of June was an $800 million stake in Chinese tech giant Alibaba, and Tepper made a significant investment in the second quarter into UnitedHealth Group, taking advantage of a steep decline in the company’s stock price. His portfolio also includes “Magnificent Seven” stocks Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet. Point72 has rapidly grown in size since it opened to outside capital in 2018 and now manages $40 billion in its multi-strategy funds. The firm generated $5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, with its main fund returning a reported 19%. Cohen has used some of his earnings to try to make his beloved New York Mets a World Series contender, buying the MLB team for $2.4 billion in 2020 and committing a 15-year, $765 million contract to poach superstar slugger Juan Soto from the crosstown Yankees last winter. Millennium manages $78 billion and is reportedly looking to sell a minority stake in its business at a valuation of $14 billion. Selling general partnership stakes to firms like Blue Owl or Petershill Partners has become common for elite private equity firms over the past decade, and several private equity giants are also publicly traded. Investors have generally shied away from owning pieces of hedge funds on the other hand, due to the more volatile nature of the business, but with some funds producing steady returns and locking up assets for longer periods of time, Millennium could be starting a trend. Dalio sold off his ownership stake in Bridgewater and resigned from its board this year, half a century after he founded the firm in 1975, though he reportedly remains invested in its funds. Bridgewater’s assets under management have declined to $92 billion, from a high of $168 billion in 2019, during a period marked by middling performance and a prolonged leadership transition. Its flagship Pure Alpha fund rebounded with an 11.3% gain in 2024, its best year since 2018, and gained another 17% in the first half of this year. Ackman’s ambitious plans to launch a closed-end fund for U.S. investors with as much as $25 billion in new assets ended in failure when he scrapped its IPO in July 2024, but his existing $20 billion portfolio has continued to perform well. Its net return was 10.2% in 2024, fueled by stocks like Alphabet, Chipotle and Brookfield. Ackman started buying Uber stock earlier this year; the company’s shares were his largest position as of the end of June, worth $2.8 billion. He is also hoping to transform real estate developer Howard Hughes Holdings into a diversified holding company emulating Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Kovner left Caxton in 2011, handing the reins to his successor Andrew Law, after founding and running the firm for 28 years. Kovner now manages his portfolio through his family office CAM Capital and has invested in several life sciences and biotech startups in recent years, including Kriya Therapeutics, which develops gene therapies to treat chronic diseases, and Palvella Therapeutics, which is focused on treating genetic skin diseases. Shaw stepped back from day-to-day management of D.E. Shaw in 2001, leaving it in the hands of a seven-person executive committee that today manages $70 billion. But Shaw remains the firm’s principal owner, according to its SEC filings. D.E. Shaw’s flagship Composite and Oculus funds gained 18% and 36% in 2024, respectively, helping the firm produce $11.1 billion in gains, more than any other hedge fund according to LCH Investments.

ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Most hedge funds have lagged behind the AI-fueled stock market surge of the past three years, opting for lower-risk investments. But that hasn’t stopped investor money from clamoring to get access to the top firms—or investment gains and carried interest from adding billions to their billionaire owners’ pockets.

Title: Ripple’s XRP the Next Amazon? — Analyst Says Long-Term Path to $100 Could Shock XRP Army

Time Published: 2025-09-11T10:20:30Z

Crypto analyst Nick Anderson is drawing parallels between XRP’s price chart and Amazon’s early consolidation. On his BullRunners show, Anderson noted that Amazon’s stock traded roughly flat for about 3,800 days (over 10 years) after 2000, before breaking out in 2010. From roughly $5 then, AMZN went on a 3,900% rally to $200 over the next 15 years. Anderson argues XRP is in a similar sideways phase now. With XRP around $3.02 (near its 2018 peak), XRP is “using its previous high as support,” just as Amazon did before its long run. If history rhymes, he speculates, XRP could eventually repeat Amazon’s surge, potentially heading toward $100–$200 in the distant future. Anderson’s observation hinges on chart patterns. He compared XRP’s multi-year base to Amazon’s pre-boom price action. Amazon’s breakout came after forming a huge cup-and-handle pattern around 2010. Likewise, Anderson sees XRP building a large consolidation now. “XRP has mirrored AMZN’s performance,” he said, noting XRP is “currently in a similar consolidation phase.” In both cases, a prior high became support: Amazon held near $5, and XRP is holding near $2.97. This means the crypto is consolidating around its 2018 all-time high, he points out, before any potential breakout. The headline prediction is ambitious. Anderson suggests XRP could eventually reach $100–$200, mirroring Amazon’s move from $5 to $200. At current prices (about $2.80), that implies a roughly 3,400–6,900% gain. XRP would have to surge by 3,433% and 6,967%” to hit $100 and $200, respectively. Such a move would take years or even decades. Anderson stresses any breakout would be gradual: he projects XRP reaching only $5–$30 in the current market cycle, with the $100+ level not seen until well into the 2030s. Other analysts echo that forecast but add caveats. For example, crypto strategist Paul Barron says a “perfect storm” of catalysts (like ETF approvals and a Ripple banking license) could drive XRP past $50 and even toward $100. He adds that even a sharp pullback after such a move might still leave XRP on a much higher base (potentially a $30–$40 floor). Still, Barron agrees that the timeline is long: a decade or more, not weeks or months. In the near term, Anderson’s targets are far more modest. He argues that in the current cycle, XRP might rally only into the single digits. Specifically, he forecasts a run to about $5 to $30 in this rally phase. Crucially, he warns that a sharp correction would likely follow this. After the current upswing, Anderson expects a major pullback “paving the way for true adoption” later. This echoes common crypto-cycle patterns, where prolonged rallies end in sell-offs before the next big move. Technical analysts observe bullish setups for that mid-cycle rally. Some point to chart patterns that could carry XRP toward $5 and beyond while Bitcoin re-tests key levels. But all agree: such gains are not a straight shot. And as Anderson repeatedly notes, any price spikes to new highs will probably be followed by volatility. In his view, the token’s next upswing will take many years, not just months, to play out. Across the board, analysts stress patience. At $3 today, XRP is still far from its aspirational targets. Anderson’s scenario assumes long-term holds: he even notes that many long-term XRP investors (for example, those in their 30s now) would be middle-aged by the time a $100 price arrives. In other words, wealth from this thesis comes slowly. As one observer put it, the most effective approach is “a long-term strategy of accumulation and patience,” holding through interim pullbacks while waiting for broader adoption. Analyst Zach Rector, a vocal XRP proponent, agrees that volatility is guaranteed. He warns big spikes could quickly reverse – “if XRP goes to 50 bucks, don’t run and tell your wife… that could be cut in half again,” he said.

Title: Google TPUs Vs Nvidia GPUs

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google has begun placing its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in data centres run by smaller cloud providers that have long relied on Nvidia's GPUs. This is more than a product rollout—it's a calculated move in the AI infrastructure chess game. The effects extend across the AI ecosystem, creating both opportunity and uncertainty for investors. While individual AI names like Google and Nvidia could see heightened volatility as the landscape shifts, those seeking exposure with less single-stock risk might prefer diversified approaches. The High Quality Portfolio, for example, has comfortably outperformed its blended benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 91% since inception, letting investors participate in these structural shifts across multiple quality companies instead of betting on a single winner. Separately, see – How Oracle Stock Surges 3x To $900? TPUs are Google's purpose-built AI chips designed specifically for machine-learning tasks. While Nvidia's GPUs are versatile general-purpose processors, TPUs act like specialized scalpels optimized for AI workloads. The latest Ironwood chip delivers 42.5 exaflops of compute per pod with more than 9,200 chips per unit—“more than 10x improvement” over Google's previous generation. Also, take a look at – How Does Google Stock Rise 2x? This puts Nvidia in an uncomfortable spot: Still, Nvidia enjoys a massive ecosystem and deep relationships. The key question: Can Google win meaningful share before Nvidia responds? This is not just about chips—it’s about control of the AI infrastructure stack. Google is effectively telling the market, “You don’t need Nvidia’s ecosystem anymore.” Yet in reducing dependence on Nvidia, customers may increase dependence on Google’s technology. For buyers, the trade-off is clear: would you rather be locked into Nvidia or Google? Separately, look at – Are Nvidia Investors Ignoring This Big Risk? Google’s custom TPU push is a bid to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. But this isn’t a simple one-on-one duel. With companies like Broadcom, AMD, and Marvell advancing their own chips, AI hardware is now a multi-player race. That’s good for the industry—more competition, more choice, and potentially lower costs. For investors, it signals a heating AI infrastructure market with no guaranteed single winner. Nvidia isn’t finished, but the competition is tougher than ever. While the AI arms race intensifies, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000) to deliver strong returns. Why? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to benefit from upbeat markets while limiting losses when conditions turned, as shown in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. I was in Scottsdale yesterday, recording a podcast on site at Deloitte’s Next Generation CEO Program, when news about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk began to trickle in. We had been talking about the challenge of being a public figure in business or politics these days, the need for visionary and visible leadership, when visibility can come at a price. Many CEOs have been on high alert since UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down in midtown Manhattan last year while walking to an investor meeting. We’ve seen anger mounting on college campuses—Kirk was speaking at Utah Valley University—along with increased threats to leaders and public calls to violence. Those realities impact how I report. I’ve been more mindful of my own security since my former colleague Daniel Pearl was murdered in 2002. Gone are the days when terrorists would turn to a journalist to tell their story. Instead of protecting journalists, a press badge can make us a target. I’m more sensitive to the consequences of my reporting on others, having seen someone fired for a quote that felt mild to me but provocative to his paranoid employer. That’s more a result of experience than caution. I’ve long advised billionaires to stop giving me their kids’ names. I don’t chase down big names for trite quotes that no one needs to read, nor do I dig for details that people have a right to keep private. Conversations about policy are more likely to be off the record in this environment but I’m still clear that my customer is the reader, not the people we cover. I was once stalked by a man who felt entitled to harass me about something I’d said on early-morning TV. I dismissed him as an eccentric with too much time on his hands until he emailed one day to ask why I’d brought a baby into the office. That baby was mine, and our security team realized he’d been hanging around the lobby. It was a wakeup call about risks, which is sadly bound to be top of mind this morning for any CEO or public figure.

Ellison becomes world’s richest person Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is now the world’s richest person with a net worth near $393 billion, beating out Elon Musk on Wednesday, per the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index. Ellison’s wealth increased by more than $100 billion this week spurred by optimism about the company’s business which was buttressed by Oracle’s earnings call on Tuesday, during which CEO Safra Catz predicted $18 billion in cloud infrastructure business for the fiscal year—up 77% from fiscal 2025—and up to $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in fiscal 2030. Trump meets with Polish President On Wednesday, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones? Here we go!”—responding to reports that Polish forces had shot down several Russian drones after they entered Poland’s airspace. Trump also held a call with Polish President Karol Nawrocki on Wednesday, according to Nawrocki’s social media updates. Justice Department appeals for Trump’s ability to fire Fed Gov The U.S. Justice Department has asked a federal appeals court for permission for President Trump to dismiss Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook after a U.S. District Judge temporarily blocked her removal. If the appeals court upholds the block, the dispute is likely to advance to the Supreme Court.

Title: Nebius Stock: Next AWS In The Making?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/11/nebius-stock-next-aws-in-the-making/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Shares of Nebius Group stock (NASDAQ: NBIS) increased by over 45% in after-hours trading on Monday following the company’s announcement of a significant deal to supply Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with GPU infrastructure capacity valued at $17.4 billion over a five-year span. Different from conventional hyperscalers like Amazon’s AWS or Microsoft’s Azure, which provide a wide array of general-purpose cloud services, Nebius falls into a new category referred to as “Neoclouds” – specifically targeting high-performance infrastructure tailored for AI tasks. The firm delivers computing, storage, managed services, and tools aimed at developing, fine-tuning, and executing AI models. So what implications does this deal hold for Nebius, and does it enhance the attractiveness of the stock? This agreement is transformative for Nebius. In an SEC filing, the company stated that GPU services will be implemented in several tranches, with an overall contract total of $17.4 billion through 2031. Microsoft also holds the option to acquire an extra $2 billion in services. Over the five-year period, this translates to revenues exceeding $3.5 billion annually – a significant increase compared to Nebius’s anticipated revenues of only $570 million for 2025. Microsoft has increasingly relied on third-party solutions to tackle a deficit in cloud infrastructure aimed at AI workloads. The software giant has frequently encountered shortfalls in the AI compute capacity required for both its internal AI product development and the sale of Azure-branded AI services. Additionally, Microsoft is dedicated to providing computing resources to its AI partner OpenAI, which further strains its capacity. To satisfy this demand, Nebius will supply Microsoft with dedicated capacity from a new data center located in Vineland, New Jersey, starting later this year. The company also revealed that it is assessing financing options to expedite growth, with capital expenditures for this deal supported by cash flow generated from the contract and debt secured against it. However attractive it may be, investing in a single stock comes with high risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio has been designed to mitigate stock-specific risk while providing upside exposure. With the demand for generative AI remaining strong, even though there are other specialized competitors in the field, Nebius distinguishes itself for several reasons. First, the company maintains a close partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which produces the most advanced chips and effectively sets industry standards. Nvidia acts as both a key partner and investor, having participated in a $700 million funding round last year and owning over 1 million shares of the company. This connection might afford Nebius prioritized access to Nvidia's highly coveted GPUs, such as the Blackwell super chips, in comparison to other cloud service providers. This could represent a significant edge in a GPU market constrained by supply, where demand significantly surpasses availability, especially for cutting-edge chips. Another aspect that differentiates Nebius is its vertically integrated model. The company designs its own servers internally, eliminating the need for OEMs and engaging directly with manufacturers to reduce costs, optimize performance more effectively, and swiftly incorporate the latest GPUs. This degree of control not only lessens supply chain dependencies but also accelerates deployment cycles. This is crucial for keeping pace with rapid AI lifecycles and also provides the company with an advantage in terms of performance-per-watt compared to its competitors. Is Nebius stock a wise purchase at the current price of around $95 per share? The stock trades at roughly 40 times consensus FY’25 revenue. In comparison, larger competitor CoreWeave trades at about 10 times FY’25 revenue. However, several justifiable reasons exist for the higher valuation. To begin with, Nebius' growth prospects are strong. According to consensus estimates, Nebius's sales are expected to grow by 160% next year, outpacing CoreWeave, and this figure could be notably higher when considering the MSFT deal. Furthermore, Nebius's technological advantages, such as its proprietary technology stack, may aid in setting it apart from its rivals. By managing both hardware and software, Nebius is able to fine-tune performance for specific AI workloads, giving it a long-term competitive advantage. Nebius additionally possesses a solid balance sheet. As of the end of the most recent quarter, NBIS debt stood at $1.2 billion, leading to a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 5%. The cash for NBIS (including cash equivalents) accounts for $1.7 billion of a total of $5.1 billion in assets, resulting in a Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 32.9%. This should enable Nebius to continue expanding its global presence with lower financial risk. This could lead to significant interest expenses and potentially hinder profitability in the long run, even with its rapid revenue growth. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this success? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with diminished risk compared to the benchmark index; there’s been less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How Much Does It Cost To Advertise on Instagram in 2025?

Hundreds of U.S.-based marketing professionals shared what their businesses pay to advertise on Instagram. Instagram advertising costs depend on several factors, including bids, ad relevancy, seasonality, and industry. On average, though, businesses pay $0.01 – $0.25 per click, $0.01 – $4.00 per 1000 impressions, and $0.03 – $0.08 per engagement. Learn more about how much it costs to advertise on Instagram — including how to lower your costs — in this guide! View Instagram Ad Services On average, Instagram advertising costs $0.01 – $0.25 per click, $0.01 – $4.00 per 1000 impressions, and $0.03 – $0.08 per engagement. Lots of factors can influence how much you pay for your Instagram ads, including your ad budget, ad type, industry, and more. Explore how much Instagram ads cost compared to other networks: How much you spend on Instagram advertising costs can fluctuate depending on the size of your business. For example, larger businesses may spend more advertisements to remain competitive. Here’s a breakdown of Instagram advertising costs by business size to give you a better idea of how much your business will spend: (1 – 10 Employees) (11 – 50 Employees) (51 – 250 Employees) (251 – 500 Employees) (501+ Employees) Several factors determine Instagram advertising costs, including the following: Yes. In fact, 76% of marketers say they are happy with the return on investment (ROI) they receive from their Instagram ad campaign. A few of the reasons why Instagram’s advertising costs are well worth the price include: While you can divide your ad spend between networks, Instagram tends to deliver the best performance when it comes to CTRs. A study by Fortune, for example, discovered that Instagram ads maintain a CTR that is 2.5 times greater than other social media networks. Of course, your CTRs will depend on your target audience, as well as your ads. Like Facebook, Instagram provides your business with advanced targeting options. You can use these targeting options, from location to interests, to achieve a higher return from your ads. Instead of targeting everyone interested in sports, for instance, you could narrow that interest to people interested in volleyball. Another reason why Instagram advertising costs are worth the price tag? The results. In a recent study, Shopify discovered that the average order value for Instagram users is $65. Even though Facebook generates a significant amount of social media sales, its average order value is $55 — $10 less than Instagram. Keep in mind, however, that Facebook ads tend to cost more than Instagram ads. A study by Forrester also found that Instagram earns impressive engagement rates compared to other networks. Instagram leads when it comes to engagement rates, offering ten times the engagement rates of Facebook. When you have people that engaged with a network, it allows for your business to benefit from advertising. If you can create ads that target the right users, you can get them to click on your ad, like your page, or buy your product. Besides generating higher order values, Instagram ads also maintain higher conversion rates than other networks. The average conversion rate for Instagram ads is 1.08%. In comparison, the average conversion rate for Pinterest ads is 0.54% and 0.77% for Twitter ads. While the cost of Instagram ads is worth it, it’s important to remember that earning great results from Instagram requires a great ad campaign. You need to develop and optimize your strategy continuously to get the kind of results you want from Instagram ads. On average, businesses allocate 11% – 20% of their total advertising budget to Instagram ads. How much you allocate towards Instagram ads will depend on your company’s unique needs and goals, along with the return you receive from your Instagram ad campaign. When it comes to advertising on social media, you want to do whatever you can to lower the cost for advertising on these platforms. Here are a few best practices that will help you lower the cost of your Instagram ads and maximize your return on them. If you’re new to Instagram advertising, it’s beneficial to use automatic bidding for your campaign. It’s an easy way for you to get a bid that is the best for your campaign. Automatic bidding is beneficial to your business if you don’t have any previous data telling you about a good CPC to set for your campaign. It will help you set the bid amount that’s right for your campaign. When you use automatic bidding, you prevent your business from overbidding to run an ad. The lack of previous data can make it difficult for you to know the best bid amount. You may think you need to bid more than you actually do. Using automatic bidding helps you set the right bid amount until you obtain data that helps you guide your campaign. It’s a great way to reduce your Instagram advertising costs. When you set up your Instagram ads, the goal is to reach people that will be interested in your products or services. To drive the best results for your campaign, use precise targeting to reach your ideal audience. Instagram allows you to target people through: When you use precise targeting, you reach more people interested in your products and services. This means your ad copy will be more relevant to them, which will allow you to get a higher ad rank and lower CPC. It will also lead to an increase in conversions, which helps offset the cost of running the campaign. Whenever you run a marketing campaign, it’s crucial that you set goals for your campaign. Setting goals will help keep you focused on what you want to achieve with your ad. There are three main goals you’ll want to focus on achieving with your Instagram ads: By setting goals, you’ll have a more cohesive campaign. You’ll know what you want to achieve, which will allow you to create more cohesive ad copy. Better ad copy leads to more engagement and more conversions. Creating more relevant landing pages is another great way to reduce your Instagram ad costs. Many companies make the mistake of directing leads to their home page after clicking on their Instagram ad. It doesn’t encourage engagement because people aren’t directed to a landing page that is relevant to the ad. When you create an Instagram ad, the creative and ad link should be cohesive. If you’re advertising your stylish boot collection, your ad link should direct people to a page filled with your boots. Directing them to your homepage isn’t relevant to the ad you created because it’s focused on your entire store instead of specifically focusing on boots! This is where landing pages help. You can direct leads to a page that is created and tailored to your ad content. Relevant landing pages result in more conversions. When people are directed straight to the product they see in the ad, they are more likely to convert. This helps you recoup the costs you pay to run your campaign. If you want to create a truly effective campaign and lower how much it costs to advertise on Instagram, you must build dedicated landing pages that encourage conversion. If you want to lower your Instagram ad price, you must test your ad. Whenever you create ad copy, it’s never going to be the best or most effective version of your ad. It’s crucial that you test to your ad to ensure that you’re putting out the best possible version. Testing your ad helps you create more relevant ad copy. Relevant ad copy means you’ll get a higher ad position, which leads to a lower CPC. It’s an easy and efficient way to lower your Instagram advertising costs.

Instagram ads are paid content that appears in newsfeeds and stories. Instagram ads are targeted towards people most likely to be interested in your products or services. People see Instagram ads based on their demographic data, as well as their interests. These ads are meant to blend in seamlessly to the point where users barely recognize them as ads. There are two indications of content being a paid advertisement. The first sign is the word “sponsored” written under the company’s name. The second sign is the call-to-action (CTA) that appears at the bottom of the picture. These typically have phrases like “shop now” or “learn more” depending upon the campaign’s goal. When you run an Instagram ad campaign, you’ll have your choice of advertising formats. There are four main types of ads: Story ads are the newest option for advertisers to reach interested users. Considering that over 500 million Instagram accounts use stories every day, it’s a great opportunity to connect with people. People take a look at business’s Instagram stories, too. In fact, 33% of the most viewed Instagram stories are from businesses. People want to hear from businesses through the stories function, so having a paid ad wouldn’t seem out of place. These Instagram stories make full use of the screen. If someone sees your Instagram story ad, they will only see that on their screen. It helps you get your audience to focus fully on your ad. Story ads are very effective for your audience. They engage with them and check out your products. Although it’s a newer feature, it has the power to drive valuable results for your business. Photo ads are the most common ads on Instagram. These are pictures that appear in your audience’s Instagram feed. Instagram photo ads appear in a square frame or portrait frame. As mentioned previously, these ads have a CTA button at the bottom of the photo and a sponsored tag. With these ads, it’s crucial that you choose the right photo. You want your photo to fit in with Instagram’s style. Having a photo that looks too stock photo-like will stand out and could deter people from interacting with your ad campaign. To have an effective campaign, you must choose a photo that balances looking like a regular Instagram post with choosing a photo that embodies your brand image. Video ads are another option for your Instagram ad campaign. These operate similar to photos, except the content contains a video. These videos can be up to 60 seconds long. Videos are great for capturing your audience’s attention. When they scroll through their feed and get to your ad, the ad will immediately start playing. It’s a great way to catch your audience’s attention and get them interested in your ad. It’s important to note, however, that the videos automatically play without sound. This is important to think about when you create your video ad because you don’t want your audience to miss important information. If you put your most important information in the first few seconds, your audience is likely to miss it. Instagram video ads are an effective way to engage your audience and get them to check out your business. Carousel ads are a great option to get your audience to interact with your ad. These ads allow you to post multiple photos or videos in one post. It’s a great way to provide your audience with many options for your products. Let’s say you’re promoting a new fashion line. Showcasing one piece wouldn’t do justice to the line. While it does represent the new line, it doesn’t show people the variety in your clothing line. By using a carousel ad, you could use multiple photos and videos to showcase your product line. It enables you to show your audience variety, which engages more people. One outfit may spark interest in your audience over another outfit. Using carousel ads is a great way to garner engagement and interest in your ads. You’ll give your audience multiple visuals to look at and get them interested in your products or services. If you’re ready to start running Instagram ads, there are three different ways to start running ads: When you access ads in the Instagram app, you can share posts you’ve already created on Instagram. You’ll go into the app and select the post you want to promote. Once you select the post, you can launch it as an ad. Once you launch your promoted post, you can start tracking how many people see your post and interact with it. Instagram ads use the same Ad Manager tool as Facebook. If you want to run ads through this program, it’s easy and efficient. When you use Ads Manager, you can set up your campaign, make alterations to your campaign, and monitor the results. It’s a great way to run your Instagram advertising campaign. If you’re short on time or need extra help with your campaign, you have the option to use Instagram partners. Instagram partners can help you run your campaign if you don’t have time or don’t know how to run a campaign. With Instagram partners, you’re working with proven experts that are vetted by Instagram. They will help you buy ads and deliver valuable creative. It’s a great alternative for businesses that don’t have experience.

Title: Most marketers think we’ll rely on AI to produce most creative content by 2030

Advertisement September 11, 2025 | 9 min read Listen to article 4 min It’s just one finding from a new WPP report on senior marketers’ visions for advertising’s near future. We sit down with the author. What will advertising, media and our consumer lives look like in 2030? A new report asks experts. / Drmakete Lab Via Unsplash Decide for yourself how alarmed you are by a future where most ‘creative content’ (including art, music, TV shows and movies) is created by AI. But according to the 2025 edition of WPP Media’s Advertising in 2030 report, most marketers think that reality will already be with us in five years’ time. A follow-up to similar reports in 2020 and 2021, the research digs into the credence that top marketers and analysts give to certain possible near-future scenarios. The portion of respondents predicting this AI-dominated media future (now at 71%) was the greatest ‘positive’ shift in sentiment since the last edition of the report, reflecting the dizzying pace of AI-related change marketers are seeing right now. One expert interviewed for the research, attention primo Karen Nelson Field, said: “The rate of transformation in only two years since AI became accessible is astounding. Nothing will be the same across the entire advertising ecosystem in 2030.” Plenty of the study’s respondents argue that 2030 is too soon a date to predict such a major shift, or that AI is more likely to dominate advertising content than narrative entertainment, or that AI will play only a partial role. But the portion treating the scenario seriously is striking. Other formerly science-fictional scenarios viewed as likely by the study’s cohort include a 2030 where most interactions between brands and consumers are ‘bot-to-bot,’ with individuals’ personal assistants liaising directly with customer service bots. Citing efficiency, convenience and the rapidly developing sophistication of ‘agentic AI,’ 66% of respondents viewed the scenario as likely – although most (61%) don’t think we’ll yet have passed the tipping point at which most social media ‘users’ are fictitious personae. Nor do they say, on balance, that they’re expecting the efficiencies associated with automation will result in reduced working hours or wages, with 66% rejecting that scenario – despite conceding “downward pressure on wages in some sectors.” But how likely is it, really, that an industry so totally overhauled by scaled AI’s promises of efficiencies and cost-savings won’t see those efficiencies reflected in billable hours and headcounts? The report’s lead author, WPP Media’s global president of business intelligence Kate Scott-Dawkins, tells The Drum that there’s evidence in that sentiment of “a desire to be optimistic about these things in the face of so much change,” but that there may also be some reason for that optimism. “Our industry is already one of the most integrated with AI and, if you look at job numbers now in the ad industry versus 10 years ago when we first started seeing Google and Meta applying machine learning and natural language processing and all these optimization programs, we’re not dramatically worse off… So there’s some rationale for people thinking it’ll just look different. We won’t be doing the same things, but our industry has continued to grow and we’ll just be doing new things with the help of AI. We may lose some jobs and types of jobs, but I can understand why they are optimistic about the industry as a whole.” (That optimism should perhaps be tempered with the trajectory of employment figures across the industry since the AI revolution began in earnest: in toto, adland’s big five holding companies reduced their workforce by over 2% last year; WPP itself has suffered a 5% drop in headcount over the last year.) Advertisement Hovering above the AI of it all, Scott-Dawkins says there’s greater reason to be cheerful to be gleaned from the difference between this year’s report and its Covid-era predecessors. The original report set out to answer, first, a provocative question: will advertising even continue to exist in 10 years’ time? Those Covid years, she says, were a time of soul-searching and a time where the growing adoption of adblockers, all-subs-no-ads media channels like Netflix, behove the industry to ask itself existential questions. Taking stock of where the industry as a whole finds itself in 2025 shows that question has almost entirely receded from view: Netflix is now, per a headline in these pages, ‘All-in on ads’; in 2024, the global ad business saw revenues of over $1tn for the first time in history. If anything, Scott-Dawkins says, in 2025 we see an industry hungrier than ever to expand its coverage. “I’ve seen a noticeable shift in the number and types of companies that are selling advertising now, with this realization that it can be a useful revenue stream, especially in low-margin businesses like retail. And now we’re getting into all the different places where you can have screens and consumer interaction” – with growth expected not just in retail media, but transit, transport, wearables… “You can picture this world where we’re able to turn any sort of surface and glass into content. That’s an interesting counterpoint to where we were five years ago.” Other stark shifts from where we were five years ago: the metaverse, cause celebre of the industry until the AI hype cycle engulfed all the space around it, has fallen away almost entirely, taking with it predictions about growth in uses of virtual and augmented reality tech (though, Scott-Dawkins says, the experts weren’t that convinced back in 2020 either – “they’re as pessimistic now as they were then”). Scott-Dawkins goes on: “What they got wrong was the sustainability piece.” In what the report calls a “striking reversal,” predictions that the environmental impact of goods and services would be more important to us than price by 2030 swung radically. In 2020, 70% thought that was likely. Now, 74% say it’s unlikely. Acknowledging a “cultural realignment” and “greenwashing fears” on the corporate side, the report declares that “consumers and marketers both seem to be moving on.” Advertisement In the data and privacy worlds, the report finds a balance of experts predicting by 2030 the widespread use of biometric data to access and personalize services; the widespread personalization of goods and services; and the widespread accessibility of personal data by corporations and governments. But they reject as unlikely the development of single, global approaches. In tech and media, most experts rejected as unlikely a scenario where 3D printing would replace mass production. They also rejected a scenario in which “seamless micropayments” replace subscription and ad models for online publishers, and one in which most products and services would be bought as part of a subscription. They mostly agreed that the same internet service providers, platforms and social media companies would remain intact until 2030, despite ongoing antitrust actions. For publishers, they predict more change, with 63% seeing it as likely that most news consumption would come from individual creators, ‘citizen journalists’ and bots. As the next decade approaches, what’s most striking, says Scott-Dawkins, is that “people got more pessimistic across the board” – less likely, that is, to predict changes to the status quo. Will the study run again before 2030? Maybe – but maybe the AI question will by then have become even more all-pervasive. “Maybe, I don’t know, we’ll be asking AI about itself.” Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Title: Oracle CEO Safra Catz's net worth rises $412 million in a day as stock hits record highs

Oracle Corp.’s stock rally this week has not only lifted the software giant’s market value but also added significantly to the personal wealth of its chief executive officer, Safra Catz. According to CNBC, Catz’s net worth surged by about $412 million during the first six hours of trading on Wednesday after the company’s strong earnings report sent its shares up nearly 40%. Forbes estimates her net worth at $3.4 billion as of Wednesday afternoon, compared with $3 billion earlier in the day. The jump followed Oracle’s disclosure of $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, contracted revenue that has yet to be recognised. The figures underline the company’s accelerating growth in cloud services and its expanding role in powering artificial intelligence workloads. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder, benefited even more from the rally. His net worth soared to an estimated $386.3 billion, making him the world’s second-richest person, up from $293 billion at the start of the trading day. “Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads,” Catz said on the company’s earnings call, citing new cloud contracts with firms such as OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia and AMD. Catz, who has been Oracle’s sole CEO since 2019, has overseen a more than 800% rise in the company’s stock price during her tenure. She previously led Oracle’s M&A strategy, completing high-profile acquisitions including PeopleSoft and Sun Microsystems. Analysts across Wall Street were surprised by the scale of Oracle’s performance. Deutsche Bank’s Brad Zelnick said he was “in shock, in a very good way,” while John DiFucci of Guggenheim Securities said he was “blown away.” Bank of America analysts have forecast further upside in the stock on the back of Oracle’s strong revenue pipeline and AI-driven demand. Oracle's shares were already on the rise before the latest financial results. They increased by 45% this year through Tuesday’s close, four times the gain seen in the S&P 500. Its surge on Wednesday also boosted other AI stocks, including Nvidia, which rose 3.8%. In Asia, Nvidia suppliers rallied in Japan and South Korea, with Advantest Corp. up over 3% and SK Hynix Inc. increasing by 5.6%. The company's forecast underscores the need for global AI developers to step up their investments. OpenAI, an Oracle customer, predicts it will need trillions of dollars over time to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and run its services. Major US companies have recently given investors grounds for optimism about the pace and sustainability of AI investment. Last week, Broadcom Inc. announced it had secured a major new customer in this sector. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Do We Need to Interview Candidates In Person Again?

Interviewing I help hiring teams improve speed & quality. Ex-Amazon, Ex-Expedia. September 11, 2025 Are we about to go full circle and return to in-person interviews for most salaried roles? COVID pushed us to remote, Zoom-based interviews. Emerging tech then allowed employers to leverage AI to prompt interviewers on questions to use to interview humans. And now those candidates are responding by using AI to ace interviews. Which has caused folks like me to push TA leaders to get out ahead of this. Especially because some employers are even encouraging candidates to use AI during the interviewing process. If everyone is using AI, how will we know what a candidate can actually do? Does it matter if they need AI to do great work, as long as it’s great work? Will the future be bot-on-bot action, with employer AI agents screening and interviewing candidate bots? I’m not sure, but what I do know is that some companies are going old school, returning to in-person interviews, mostly because they’re fearful of hiring someone who’s aced the interview only because they have help from AI. 1. Based on my conversations with heads of TA, candidate use of AI is about 80% of the pull to return to in-person interviews. With the rising risk of candidate fraud — especially AI-assisted identity fraud and cheating — companies like Google and Deloitte are starting to prioritize in-person live interviews over remote video interviews. If you’re just getting up to speed on the risks, check out some of my previous articles here: 2. Another small reason for the return to in-person interviews — maybe 15% — is related to the big shift back to in-office work. Several TA leaders I spoke with said in-person interview requests are being driven somewhat by a need for a realistic job preview and an improved opportunity to connect with and sell candidates. In-person allows the candidate to meet the team in person, see the office and learn about their commute pattern, and experience the culture. 3. The third reason — maybe explaining just 5% of the pull — is related to beliefs that 1) soft skills and motivation are even more important to predicting success in a world where most knowledge is just a quick ChatGPT prompt away and that 2) human interviewers can better evaluate those soft skills in person, sitting across from the candidate. I think most of us have mixed feelings on this. The table below outlines the pros and cons of live, in-person interviews: The good news? Companies are 100% prepared for this shift back to in-person interviews. Just kidding. Most of us are not ready. In fact, because of the uncertain economy, recruiter and recruiting coordinator layoffs, more reliance on assessment-related tech to interview, and generally slower hiring, candidate experience and interviewer capabilities have not improved in the past three years. In fact, if you talk to candidates and hiring managers in focus groups as my team does, they’ll often say it’s gotten worse. What do we need to do if you and your business leaders decide to return to in-person interviews as the norm? 1. Training: We need to ensure our hiring teams are trained, not just in behavioral interviewing, legal risks, biases, and process. They also need to be aligned on your company’s new hard and soft skill needs — AI is disrupting a lot of jobs, so a more prescriptive weighting and shared philosophy on what’s trainable and what’s not will be key to selecting the right talent. For some companies, that’ll mean a smaller weighting on hard skills and a bigger emphasis on soft skills like curiosity, empathy, learning agility, building trust, influence/gaining buy-in, problem-solving, and communication skills. For others, that’ll mean a bigger focus on the expert skills and smaller focus on the supporting skills - and unfortunately, expert skills and soft skills are harder to evaluate than the supporting skills that AI will likely take over. 2. Candidate experience: Take advantage of the in-person interview to create a better candidate experience. In-demand candidates still need to be sold, even if it’s an employer’s market. Show off that expensive real estate, go old school and set up a non-interview lunch with the team, and get an executive to jump in and wow them with insights into your company’s compelling future. Some of us might need to rebuild the muscles around creating a great candidate experience for interviewed candidates, which includes excellent preinterview instructions on what to expect, a nice “we’re expecting you” greeting with reception/security, on-time, prepared interviewers, and excellent communication and expectation setting on next steps. This focus on CX might even bring us back to hiring recruiting coordinators. 3. Scheduling: Place advance holds on busy interviewer and hiring manager calendars for in-office interviews and same-day hiring decisions. We need speed to get quality, so don’t let in-person interviews cause you to miss out on top talent. 4. Identity verification: Ensure you have a mechanism to ensure that the person you screened over Zoom is the same person who shows up for your in-person interviews. Identity fraud — where someone uses AI or another interviewer to complete and pass the pre–onsite interview screen and assessments — is a bigger problem than it used to be. Talk to your HR and security team about the rigor needed to verify identity. 5. Talent advising: Train your recruiters to move from transactional process owners to true Talent Advisors. The business needs us in TA to level up the role we play in interviewing and selection given the renewed prioritization on quality of hire. Check out these free resources I’ve pulled together on how to be a Talent Advisor. And if you’re going to LinkedIn Talent Connect in San Diego in October, sign up for one of my sessions on quality of hire and reducing candidate fraud. 6. Leverage AI: Use generative AI to help your hiring teams translate job description language and your company-wide values/behaviors into hiring criteria, interview focus areas, interview questions, and good answer rubrics. But don’t just trust generic AI content on interviewing — your company may have a very different hiring approach than the median content AI has been trained on. Be sure to review what AI generates and correct anything that’s not in line with the business VP’s goals around what she wants her org makeup to look like in two to three years. Too often, TA has seen the middle-funnel work of interviewing and selection as something the business designs and leads independently. In fact, I’d argue most recruiting teams play a very small role between screened-candidate presentation and the post-interview decision action items (offer or decline). That needs to change. The risks associated with AI, the cost of bad hires, and the significant time investment around hiring requires us to lead more around the middle of the funnel. This starts with leading a conversation with the business around the pros and cons of remote interviews, asynchronous assessments, AI, and in-person interviews. Are you seeing a shift in your org to in-person interviews? Just for key roles, just for salaried corporate roles, just for executive hiring? I’ll post this article on my personal LinkedIn feed, and I’d love it if you’d share your plans and the why for your approach to interviewing in 2025 and beyond.
