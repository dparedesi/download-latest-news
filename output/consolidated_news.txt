February 24, 2025 12:13 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=131243&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: Apple says it will spend $500 billion in US over next four years as it faces down Trump tariffs

Spending is said to include over 20,000 new American workers and the production of servers in Texas. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Apple today announced a plan to spend $500 billion in the United States in the next four years, including in jobs, suppliers, and building servers. This comes as Apple — like most consumer electronics companies — faces down a threat of tariffs from importing goods and components from China and other countries from President Donald Trump.The company says this is its biggest US-focused spending plan to date. Beyond jobs, it includes paying US-based suppliers, including factories owned by Texas Instruments and TSMC. Apple will build servers for Apple Intelligence at a facility in Houston, and claims it will increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund and establish an "academy" in Michigan to "train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers, and grow its research and development investments in the U.S. to support cutting-edge fields like silicon engineering." Following a meeting between Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook last week, Trump said that Cook was ceasing plants in Mexico and would increase its spend in the US. “They don’t want to be in the tariffs,” he told U.S. state governors. It's unclear which Mexican facilities Trump was referring to, though Apple supplier Foxconn has some plants there, Bloomberg points out.The Trump administration has put a 10% tariff on goods imported from China and has mentioned, but not yet enacted, a 25% tariff on chips.Apple made a similar announcement in 2018 during the first Trump administration, including jobs and a campus in Austin, Texas. It's unclear which, if any, of the investments discussed recently were previously planned prior to Trump entering office for his second term. During the first term, Trump took credit for Apple's Mac Pro plant run by a contractor, which was already in operation.In 2021, Apple announced more U.S.-based spending plans, including a $430 billion investment including a North Carolina campus, as well as jobs in silicon engineering and research and development. (That campus is currently on pause)."We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Cook said in a press release. Notably, the hiring commitments come at a time when much of big tech is going through layoffs.Cook's plans for US investments helped Apple during Trump's first terms, earning it exceptions from some tariffs on its biggest devices, including the iPhone. This time around, it appears other tech executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon chairman and former CEO Jeff Bezos, are trying to follow Cook's playbook by cultivating relationships with the president.

Title: ‘They got to get rid of it somehow’: Shopper buys 24-pack of Sprite from Walmart. Then they open up the cans

Stace Fernandez This Walmart shopper found something really strange in her Sprite cans. Now, viewers are starting to speculate. Sprite, known for its iconic lemon-lime flavor, is known to be a clear drink, unlike sodas like Dr.Pepper and Coca-Cola, which are brown, and even ginger ale, which has a slight yellow tinge. That’s why this woman was so freaked out once she started pouring the soda she just bought. In a trending TikTok, Walmart shopper Meagan McGee (@themeaganmcgee) shared the offputting thing she found when she went to open a Sprite. The clip garnered more than 200,000 views total, as it was posted twice. See, her husband just went to Walmart and picked up a 24-pack of Sprite. But when McGee opened one, the liquid inside was a dark brown. Maybe it was a fluke with just one soda being accidentally filled? That doesn’t seem to be the case. McGee had already poured out two cans, and the third had the same contents. “Every single one of these is pouring out Coke. Make it make sense,” McGee says. Now, the most logical explanation is that Coca-Cola and Sprite are owned by the same parent company. A big mistake may have been made during the packing process, and Sprite cans were incorrectly filled. But commenters have their own, potentially less plausible, theories. “I wonder to make up for the difference in sales coke cola is being sold as other products just a hunch,” a person said, referring to the Coke boycotts. “Thanks but i like my soda companies with no ICE,” another added, also in refence to the boycott. “I did some quality work in that industry and there is a way to track back to the technician who signed off for that particular can,” a commenter claimed. Last year, people started boycotting companies that donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Those boycotts have only grown as numerous big companies—including Target, Meta, Walmart, Amazon, and McDonald’s—rolled back their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Coca-Cola did donate to Trump. The soda brand was added to this boycott list, not for ending its DEI work, but because of rumors that they fired a slew of Latino workers in Texas and allegedly reported them to ICE, Yahoo reported. Let’s be clear up front: these are all rumors until evidence comes out. And so far, there is no evidence, fact-checker Distractify reported. Coca-Cola’s targeting of Latinos could have a huge business impact given that its Latin American division serves about 530 million consumers. A few other things. On layoffs: As a publicly traded company, Coca-Cola must disclose specific financial information. While not all layoffs are public record, one of the scales the rumors propose would certainly be included in their SEC filings. So far, there are no recent SEC filings or press releases on the matter.They did reportedly lay off 75 employees at the Grand Prairie, Texas plant that was closing—but that was in 2021. The Daily Dot reached out to McGee for comment via TikTok direct message and comment and to Coca-Cola via email. Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Title: A Costco executive on the luxury items its wealthy customers love

Costco (COST+1.75%) is best known for its no-frills, bulk-buying experience, but the warehouse giant also moves a surprising amount of luxury goods. From Rolex watches to gold bars, high-end items have become an integral part of the business, and according to Hamilton “Tony” James, chairman of Costco, wealthier shoppers are hooked. “We’ve known we could move anything in volume if the quality was good and the price was great,” James said in an interview with Chief Executive magazine. That’s partly why the retail giant sells everything from Dom Perignon to 10-karat diamonds. According to James, Costco’s members are not just average-income households – they also include wealthier shoppers who recognize a good deal when they see one, like a Porsche on the sales floor of a Costco in Seattle. Costco, known for its “treasure hunt” shopping experience, won’t sell just anything. Unlike rivals Amazon (AMZN-2.65%) and Walmart (WMT+3.62%), Costco is selective about what it sells. While big-box retailers like Walmart stock over 120,000 different items, Costco limits its selection to about 3,400 stock-keeping units (SKUs). “We’re not interested in selling just anything at a low price,” James said. Instead of offering a $500 TV for $250, Costco would rather sell a $1,000 TV for $500. This formula has been a massive profit boost, further buoyed by the recent surge in gold bar sales. Wells Fargo (WFC-2.61%) noted last year in a research report that the company moved between $100 million and $200 million worth of gold bars each month. James told the magazine he wasn’t sure whether affluent shoppers or those wary of the economy were driving gold bar demand, but either way, the strategy has set Costco apart. He expressed confidence in the company’s position against Amazon and Walmart, noting that Costco focuses on its own approach rather than its competitors’ moves. Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, however, dethroned Costco to claim the top spot in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) 2024 rankings for general merchandise retailers. Another area where Costco continues to be an outlier is in its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). While many corporations, such as Walmart, McDonald’s (MCD+0.86%), and Target (TGT+0.86%), have scaled back on their DEI plans, Costco has held firm.

Title: Florida Sues Target Over Trans Merchandise
URL: https://reason.com/2025/02/24/florida-sues-target-over-trans-merchandise/
Time Published: 2025-02-24T15:00:42Z
Full Content:
LGBT Elizabeth Nolan Brown | 2.24.2025 10:00 AM Florida is suing Target for selling LGBTQ-friendly merchandise, something the state is misleadingly calling "efforts to sexualize children." You're probably thinking: Wait, doesn't the First Amendment stop the government from doing things like this? Doesn't Target have a First Amendment right to sell goods broadcasting whatever perfectly legal messages it chooses, and don't individual Americans have a First Amendment right to access those messages? The answer is a resounding: of course. But Florida authorities don't seem to care, so long as they get to perform concern for children. You are reading Sex & Tech, the newsletter from Elizabeth Nolan Brown on sex, technology, bodily autonomy, law, and online culture. Want more on sex, technology, and the law? Subscribe to Sex & Tech. It's free and you can unsubscribe any time. Δ What the state considers the "sexualization of children" seems to be anything discussing gender identity or acknowledging that transgender people exist. On X, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier listed three of the products that he objects to: "rainbow sports bras for boys," swimsuits for transgender children, and books about gender identity. Like many anti-trans crusaders, Uthmeier doesn't bother elaborating on how products concerned with gender identity—whether someone identifies as male or female or neither or both—are related to sexualization. He expects his audience to take it as a given that anything related to transgender or nonbinary identities is rooted in (deviant) sexuality. As has been pointed out many times before: In cases like this, it's the anti-trans crowd who are sexualizing children, applying their adult interpretations of gender and sex to things that are not inherently sexual. A girl saying she feels like a boy is not automatically expressing anything related to sexual feelings or preferences, nor is a teenager who likes to wear elements of masculine and feminine clothing necessarily making a sexual statement. Likewise, catering to a market of transgender and nonbinary minors is not an attempt to sexualize them. And Florida isn't only objecting to products designed for children. On the first page of its massive 163-page class action complaint, the state complains about Target having sold "transgender 'tuck-friendly' women's swimsuits with 'extra crotch coverage.'" Ari Cohn, who serves as lead counsel for tech policy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, has called Florida's lawsuit "asinine, performative buffoonery and an attack on the First Amendment." The state, he noted, is objecting to products "based on the messages they convey—all of which are First Amendment–protected, and none of which 'sexualize children.'" You do have to give it to Florida authorities for creativity. Presumably aware that the state can't simply ban messages it finds distasteful, the state is trying to frame this not as a matter of censorship but as a matter of Target's corporate duty to shareholders. "Target's efforts to sexualize children caused its stock price to plummet, harming Florida's retirement fund and putting the retirements of our teachers and first responders at risk," Uthmeier said in his X post. Uthmeier accused the company of "misleading shareholders" and promoting "a harmful leftist agenda at the expense of shareholder returns." By this argument, the state could engage in all sorts of censorship so long as it bought shares in whatever companies it wanted to bully into cracking down on speech. It could even demand the suppression of certain messages on social media on in search results by buying shares in companies like Meta and Alphabet. "It's beyond question" that the products Uthmeier objects to Target having sold are "expressive items" protected by the First Amendment, noted Cohn. "That Florida's retirement fund holds shares of Target is irrelevant and meaningless. Government does not gain the power to regulate speech because it's a shareholder." If Florida thinks Target stock is a bad investment, it can divest itself of Target shares. It cannot use them as an excuse to say what sorts of perfectly legal messages the company may broadcast. Even if Florida could somehow sweep First Amendment issues aside, the state might not have much of a case. The new lawsuit, filed in federal court, "is one of at least three similar cases against Target in Florida," reports the Tallahassee Democrat. It claims that Target CEO Brian Cornell and the company's board of directors violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by failing to "oversee or disclose the obvious risks of Target's 2023 LGBT-Pride Campaign" and thus "deceived Target investors." In a previous Florida lawsuit against Target, the company disputed some similar claims. The company "repeatedly warned investors of the risk" that consumers might boycott over its initiatives, it said in a January 2024 filing in this case. Florida might be unhappy with "Target's business judgment about merchandising. But disagreeing with Target's business judgment does not give rise to an actionable claim under the securities laws." • Surrogacy is the new battlefield in reproductive freedom. • "Presenting people with more partisan video recommendations has no detectable polarizing effects on users' attitudes in the short term," according to a new study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "While we cannot rule out effects from long-term exposure or to small vulnerable subsets of users, our evidence is not consistent with prevailing popular narratives about YouTube recommendation systems radicalizing users en masse." • A new bill in Alabama would allow pregnant women to defer jail or prison sentences. "The woman would then serve a term of pre-incarceration probation under electronic supervision until 12 weeks after she gives birth," reports the Alabama Political Reporter. "That probation period would then be credited to the woman's sentence." • After Texas banned abortion in 2021, "the rate of sepsis shot up more than 50% for women hospitalized when they lost their pregnancies in the second trimester," reports ProPublica.

Title: Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer is betting on the human touch — and AI

AI tools are here to stay, Moyer says, but Vimeo wants to build on ‘authenticity.’ by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer. You probably know Vimeo from its beginnings as an artsier, more creative competitor to YouTube. But over the last few years, and especially after it went public in 2021, Vimeo has really turned itself into an enterprise software company, selling video hosting services to companies of all sizes. And this episode is a particularly fun full-circle Decoder moment — I interviewed Philip’s predecessor, Anjali Sud, both when she was the CEO of Vimeo and again more recently in her new gig as CEO of Tubi. So it was fascinating to close the loop and see how Philip is changing Vimeo after taking over, especially as the entire ecosystem of online video is shifting so rapidly. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Philip is pushing to make Vimeo a different kind of YouTube competitor, one that can support everything from independent creators to huge corporations. It’s a shift from the strategy Anjali used to reset the company and take it public, and there’s a lot of interesting nuance to it. Everyone wants to put videos on the internet, it turns out, but only some of those people want them to be ingested by YouTube’s advertising and recommendation systems. Philip himself has a ton of big tech experience: he’s worked at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and he’s deep in the weeds on both the tech and the business. You’ll hear us talk about Google’s business and YouTube in particular quite a bit in this one, but we also get into TikTok and what it means to have the incentives of algorithmic video platforms drastically influence both creators worldwide and the culture we all consume. Of course, we talked about AI, too, and how it’s upending every platform in different ways. Vimeo has been marketing itself as an “AI-powered video platform” lately, so I wanted to know what Philip is thinking about Vimeo’s creator-focused mission colliding with the pitfalls of AI-generated video. We also spent some time on the simple supply-and-demand math problem that seems like it will change the creator economy drastically in the years to come: that is, if the amount of video on the internet explodes because of AI while the total amount of time we can spend watching video remains relatively fixed, how is anyone going to make any money at all? This is a fun one; I think you can really tell that Philip and I could have kept talking for a very long time. Okay, Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Philip Moyer, you are the CEO of Vimeo. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you, Nilay. It’s great to be here. I am very excited to talk to you. I have got to tell you, just structurally, this is one of the very first truly full-circle Decoder episodes. Because we had your predecessor Anjali on as CEO of Vimeo, and then we had her on in her new job as CEO of Tubi, and now we have you on as her replacement. Wow, it’s full circle. It’s full circle for a show that’s about structure, decision-making, and organizational culture — this is as good as it gets for me. So thank you so much for joining us. That’s fantastic. I have a lot of respect for Anjali and have to say a big thank you to her for all she built here, so it’s wonderful to hear. I’m very curious. Anjali was in the middle of executing a big pivot when we talked about Vimeo. People know Vimeo as what it started as — a consumer video service, kind of the art-ier competitor to YouTube. She pivoted it to a [software-as-a-service] business. She was very open: “This is now a SaaS company, we’re doing a lot of enterprise work, we’re a video hosting provider to a lot of people, we are a video creation tool for small businesses.” That was several years ago. I talked to her three years ago at Vimeo. You’re the new CEO. What do you think of Vimeo today? I think in a lot of ways, I mean a little bit of what she started, and a lot of what we’re continuing here, is going back to the roots of what Vimeo is known for. People came to us because, at the time, 20 years ago, it was hard to upload video. I kind of call that… I’ll say the second or third epoch of video was right around that time period when video files were getting bigger. It was hard to stream video. They were no longer just a single file. We were starting to get multiple formats. People came to us because of the quality of our transcoding and then, ultimately, our ability to be able to serve it directly to the person that was most important that they wanted to provide that video. And a lot of what we’re doing right now, and what we’ve taken that Anjali had started and extended pretty significantly is… It turns out that lots and lots of organizations and individuals around the world want to be able to keep a video private or they want to be able to serve it only to an intended audience. They don’t want to have someone collect data, they don’t want to have an algorithm that tries to send them down a rabbit hole. Instead, they want to just literally be able to provide that video. And so we’re seeing that video makes up about 82 percent of the world’s internet today and we’re seeing that same concept arrive with private individuals, doctors, educators, and large organizations. And so yes, I would say that what we’re really becoming now is… Our goal is to become the largest private video distribution platform in the world. We think that there’s an increasing demand for video that isn’t public or algorithm-driven, but instead, it could be very personal and delivered at the right moment, at the right time, to the right individual. Let me try to just understand that in context. There was the beginning of [shared video], right? You’re saying there are several epochs of [online] video. There’s the beginning, which was on iOS as a “send to YouTube” button at the operating system level because no one thought that public videos were a big deal. You just needed someplace to watch videos and YouTube was that. And then YouTube grew into the social media juggernaut it is now. TikTok exists, all that’s there, and the initial reaction was that it’s very hard to compete with that. “We’ll be for enterprises, business customers have video needs, we’ll service them.” Are you saying there’s some kind of middle ground, in the middle of the spectrum between big algorithmic consumer video platforms and enterprise, where just a lot of regular people want private video sharing? We have hundreds of thousands of school districts that use us. Teachers want students to be able to upload video assignments. Especially in a world of ChatGPT and AI, teachers want to see that the student is actually doing the assignment. We’ve got tens of thousands of medical professionals who want to be able to send a video to a patient without having some algorithm capture their disease state or the question that they have. We’ve got lots and lots of marketing organizations that want to be able to serve their video over to an individual inside of a big company, or to their client, and they don’t want it to be public. And then what we’re also finding is, on the YouTube front, organizations that were hosting entire YouTube sections on their website… YouTube is redirecting its customers over to some other place. I was meeting with a really large financial services company’s CEO and the chief economist. I took them to the website and I said, “Let me show you your chief economist speaking.” I clicked on the video, and before the video played, we had to watch some advertising on some Bitcoin or something. And on the right-hand side, it said, “Here’s how the top three credit rating organizations are trying to control the world. This is the video you should watch next.” And we’re just trying to watch the economist’s video. So organizations are getting tired of being redirected or having their data captured. A lot of organizations are starting to bypass what I call the big walled gardens, and in a lot of ways we’re back in the MSN and AOL era for websites. That’s where we are with video right now and people want to be able to go directly to their consumers. They want to be able to serve the message in an unfettered way, and then ultimately, they just want to be able to ensure the highest quality and the most personalized experience. We’re seeing tremendous demand for those kinds of scenarios. Again, it’s everything from the school teacher, the fitness instructor, and in some cases, the faith institution, all the way up to some of the biggest companies in the world — and I do mean that literally the biggest companies in the world are becoming customers. I think the thing that I’m keying on there is… there’s the consumer-facing video platforms and then you have a bunch of enterprise video needs and you’re in some way describing a bunch of core enterprise customers, right? Large school districts, and companies big enough to have a chief economist. I think those are classic enterprise customers and then somewhere in the middle, those companies actually want to reach consumers without participating in algorithmic media, and that consumer surface is what Vimeo has gotten away from. Are you saying you’re pushing back towards it? We get about 100 billion views of video a year on Vimeo, and only 20 percent of it is on Vimeo.com. We show up on e-commerce platforms. I was meeting with a physician, who is an independent practitioner, a fertility doctor, and he records a video before his patients come in and he sends that video over to his patients in the fertility clinic. So we have individual proprietors, people who want to be able to share a family video or something that they learned if they had been at a doctor’s visit or otherwise — so we have lots and lots of people that are using [the platform as] individuals. Now on the filmmaker side… What is most amazing to me right now is the sheer number of filmmakers that I have coming to me, and this has really started kicking up since I’ve become CEO. I would tell you it’s been a trend for about the past six months. I have so many filmmakers that are coming to me saying, “We don’t like the deal… We don’t like the deal that we have with the big studios. We don’t like the fact that if we go to YouTube, as an example, they take 45 cents of every advertising dollar. Or if we want to go onto one of the big platforms, they’ll take as much as 50 cents of every dollar. Is there a way for me to be able to sell tickets to my audience?” In some cases, some of these filmmakers that come to us have audiences that are bigger than they might get on one of those platforms and so we’re finding people who want to go direct. Our streaming business is like that. When you post on some of these big platforms… I really encourage people to look at the terms of service of the major consumer-based video platforms. It says in their terms of service that they’re able to monetize your content any way they want to. They can reuse your content, they can serve the content, and quite frankly, they’re capturing 45 cents of every dollar in that process. So a lot of these organizations want to be able to bypass those kinds of economics. So is that you building a consumer interface? You’re saying it’s only a small percentage that’s coming to Vimeo.com. Where are they finding an audience? Is it all on their own websites? Is it on other people’s platforms? Where is that audience actually going? It’s been interesting because there is this trend among streamers in particular where they’ll go to the large platforms, they’ll get some following, and then when they want to be able to serve premium content. That’s when they’ll come over and say, “We want to put SVOD. We want to be able to put a gate in front of this content.” Or they may want to go live, they may want to go asynchronously, and so they’ll come to us and say, “Look, we want to be able to have a common library so that people can see past live events.” Plus, they want to be able to serve new content. In some cases, we’re getting organizations that want to do more interactive content — so like clickable videos, as an example. It’s a whole variety of creators that are saying, “Look, we might not want to adhere to the… let’s call it compliance requirements, the economic requirements, or the IP requirements of the big platforms. Give us an environment that we can control ourselves.” And that environment lives on their websites? Exactly. Sidemen is a great example of a group. They have one of the biggest followerships in the UK. They sold out Wembley Stadium in two hours and they famously played a soccer match where, when a yellow card was shown, one of the Sidemen held up an Uno reverse e-card to the ref and it blew up the internet over in the UK. They serve on Vimeo. They have both content that they put on YouTube or they put on Instagram, but then some of the more extended content they actually put on Vimeo, and then that library lives on us as well for a lot of things. Dropout’s is another great example of that. Try Guys is a great example of that. Zeus Networks, Martha Stewart — where they want a little bit more control over the content and they want control over the monetization more so than what the traditional platforms give you. I’m going to ask you a question, and you’re just going to have to bear with me on the mathematical nature of this question. Hopefully, it makes sense. I have a lot of CEOs of web hosting companies on the show because I’m very curious about the web in the age of platforms and where the audience comes from. The last great referrer of web traffic is, as everyone knows, Google Search; Google Search is undergoing some sort of gigantic AI-powered identity crisis. Who knows what’s going over there, but it’s changing. So I have the CEO of Squarespace or the CEO of Wix, or whatever other hosting providers, and I say, “Why does anyone build a website? Why would you do that instead of starting a TikTok channel now?” And they all say, “Well, it’s to do e-commerce, right?” Embedded in that is some sense that, “Okay, you’ve built a following on some platform, now you want to sell something to your audience. And you have to sell the spoons somewhere, so you’re going to start Spoons.com and that’s going to be hosted on Squarespace, and that’s the way it goes.” You’re describing the content itself as being valuable, and being more valuable when it’s hosted on Vimeo. Maybe you’re selling it, maybe you’re doing subscriptions, whatever you’re doing. But that’s happening on a website because you can’t transact that way on YouTube or TikTok. You can’t make the content valuable, but you’re still stuck with how you get the audience to come to the website that’s still just some fraction of a search audience or some fraction of conversions from one of the social video platforms. And that — this is the math — seems like the upper bound of your growth. Because some number of people have to come to the website, some number of people have to choose to transact on a video from the Try Guys, and that can only grow insofar as all of those individual customers can get people to come to the websites. Do you see that the web is the limiter in that way? No, not at all. I’ve worked for Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in my life. Most recently at Google, I worked in all manners of businesses and data problems, and I have this foundational philosophy that there’s actually more data behind firewalls and paywalls than there is in front. There’s more information behind those firewalls and paywalls than in front. And when I take a look at the enterprise market for video… In the past, you’d have a marketing video and it was hard, or you might have a couple of product videos for e-commerce. Or you might have, for example, the CEO’s message. Video is coming to literally every single element of business. In the same way that it’s 82 percent of the internet, it’s coming in [to business]. And so whether or not it’s that e-newsletter, whether or not it’s for sales… You look at an organization like Seismic or Gong, that records sales calls, and then it helps to coach individuals. If you watch a video, you’re 67 percent more likely to buy a product. And so we’ve got very large e-commerce customers where they now have millions of videos on us that are serving to every single product page on their website. So what I’m seeing is quite frankly that there is an explosion of video. It’s such an engaging medium. When you watch a video, you have 91 percent better retention than when you read something. A lot of the stuff that’s behind the firewall and behind the paywall is now getting video enabled, and it’s going across every single division inside of an organization, and it actually dwarfs what I’ll call a lot of the content. We’re going to see video show up in so many different ways and in so many different businesses. People are starting to use video to be able to determine efficiencies inside quick-service restaurants. They’re starting to use video to be able to evaluate what’s on a shelf and whether or not there’s a stock on the shelf. So when I think about this, I don’t think about it just in terms of one segment of our organization. Actually, the beauty of Vimeo is that we’re able to live inside and outside the firewall, and YouTube does not live inside the firewall. We’re able to hook in and sign a [business associate agreement] to do HIPAA for a doctor. YouTube’s not going to do that. You think about all the interactions in the healthcare industry that actually can be video-enabled… And so our upper bound of growth is a larger opportunity than what YouTube is focused on right now. YouTube, right now, is focused on video podcasts. They picked their shot and they’re going to take it. By the way, every time anyone says that stat about video retention, I feel like a dinosaur because I need to read. For as much video podcasting as I literally do, I am a reader. I’m an underliner. I have to underline things. I learned to highlight with five colors in law school. It’s still where I’m at. Maybe the future is video and that’s why we do a video podcast, but I’m still a reader to my core. There are three parts of the video business. We’ve talked a lot about distribution, and where you might distribute that video. It sounds like that’s where you think there’s a lot of growth across organizations, even to consumer in some new way. Then there’s monetization, which I want to go to, but the first part is the hardest and I think undergoing the most change in terms of what we expect videos to be, and that’s obviously creation. You need to make a video, you need to distribute it, you need to monetize it. The creation of video right now is super interesting because you have not just the young generation, but everybody learning to speak the language of TikTok. TikTok, I think, is most importantly expressed to people as a video editor, not just a scrolling video tool, and it’s a very powerful video editor that you can also use in CapCut. Then there’s AI, which is making it a lot easier to make all kinds of videos in all kinds of ways, and then there’s the smaller AI components, like it’s going to write a script for you that you can read and maybe that’s good. Maybe that’s bad, but it’s all just in the mix. Everyone is expecting the tools to guide them. You can see in particular how TikTok tools, challenges, filters, and templates create a kind of culture that builds upon itself. Are you thinking of that component of it? Like “We need to build an enterprise TikTok editor for people just to bring them into the pipeline?” I think there are a couple of dynamics that are happening right now. This is what gets me so excited about this… One of the biggest things that brought me here is that the barriers to video creation are dropping so dramatically, which leads to that mass proliferation of video, and then the difficulty in being able to manage at that scale. That’s just, foundationally, the market forces that are behind us. I always pause for a second and tell people, “I’ll be able to talk to you for a long time about artificial intelligence in a couple of seconds, but let me talk to you about what’s happening in video formats.” You’re one hundred percent right. Right now, we’re in that era when mobile video is becoming much easier. People are becoming more comfortable. Covid really helped us get comfortable with dogs barking in the background, babies being inserted into frames, and basically, I’ll just call it more casualness, in video. Before it was highly scripted, if you recall. Highly scripted. And so culturally, people are getting much more comfortable shooting video. The proliferation of tools has been extraordinary. Now, we did make some acquisitions in the past. Magisto was an example of this because we really felt that we had to make it easier and easier to be able to create video. Well, I was thrilled with the proliferation of tools. We shot a video for our Reframe conference. I shouldn’t say shot a video — we actually created a video using 16 AI tools that didn’t exist 18 months ago. Over $15 billion of venture capital has gone into creating those tools and that’s just one small set. But you’re absolutely right… You’ve got all these tools that are being created and so we are thrilled about that, but simultaneously, the format of video is also proliferating, and so you’ve got traditional like 1068, and you’ve got 4K that’s starting to become more commonplace. 8K is arriving. When you do 8K, it’s roughly about six times the size of a 4K video. Well, 16K and 32K televisions are on the horizon right now. You’ve got wide stream formats, square formats for podcasting, rectangular formats, and then we just recently released Apple Vision Pro support to be able to stream on an Apple Vision Pro — which is 8K per eye, 36 frames per second. Simultaneously, while the tools are proliferating, the format types are also proliferating. So, your ability to both accept video from any format… In some cases, you accept something that’s an old, old format that you have to get improved, or it’s a super high quality, giant widescreen format that needs to be cut up for all the different areas that you’re going to serve that video. What I would tell you is that it’s becoming more complex for the creator to choose which tool to use and when, and then how to ensure that the right format gets served at the right moment. So the two simultaneous things that are happening in our business are creative tools and formats, and they are exponentially growing right now. They’re exponentially growing the amount of video that a creator has to deal with. What’s growing the fastest? It’s really interesting. As you can imagine, I think the square format is popping up a lot. We are seeing a lot of demand for 4K — 4K in live formats and in serving formats. I think people are starting to demand that format more, which is obviously for us… We have to move more bits, we have to store more bits, we’ve got to transcode more bits, and so I would tell you that’s probably the thing that we’re seeing spike the most in terms of consumption. The traditional mobile stuff is going to be there and it’s going to be constant. I think it’s almost growing at the speed of so-called mobile phones, but I’m actually surprised about how many people are coming to us asking us for 4K. Why do you think that is? I look at the broader industry and you see the big streamers are pushing everybody to 1080p with ads. That’s sort of the default for Max or Netflix, and then you have to pay extra for 4K. Are you seeing that demand in the same way they do, which is that people will pay extra for it? Or are you seeing that demand as this is now the understood industry norm? It may be the place that we sit in the industry. As I mentioned at the top of our talk, people have always come to us for quality. So it may just be that because we’ve been known for quality — we’ve been known for the quality of our transcoding, our stream, the service that we do — that people are not finding that kind of support elsewhere and coming to us for it. I think that people are experimenting with those formats. I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the sheer number of people who have come to us since we launched the Apple Vision Pro. They are coming to us with really interesting film projects to do 8K per eye, stitching all the camera work together. You’ll see us talk a lot about this at SXSW, about what we think. I’m seeing some good excitement in those 8K formats as well, that’s all I’ll say, but it might just be the position that we sit in the industry. It’s so interesting to see the rest of the industry basically insist that consumers don’t care about 4K. You and I are talking two days before the Super Bowl. For all of Fox’s talk about 4K, they’re still producing that in 1080p and then upscaling it. It’s fascinating to see the consumer side of the market land at one standard quality level while you’re saying the enterprise side of the market — the more discerning part of the market — is now not only assuming that 4K will exist, but that you will support 8K per eye, 36 frames per second on the Vision Pro. And when there’s 16K for TVs out, I think people will be buying them. That’s a lot of cost, right? I mean you’re talking about moving an enormous amount of data. Are you just getting ahead of it because that’s what the customers expect? You have a background in cloud services and big data. Is that something where you say, “Okay, this is just scalable? We can solve this problem with the tools we have”? Or do you have to build new systems? It’s a little bit like… I’ll use the corollary of what’s going on with token size inside of AI models, where everybody knows that the very first version of ChatGPT was maybe, I don’t know, a hundred million tokens and then it popped over to a billion tokens and will be up to a trillion tokens. So the cost to be able to deliver all of that will come down over time. The cost of storage comes down, the cost of bandwidth comes down, and then even the innovations that are in the televisions, those costs will be coming down. When you think about the quality of the TVs we have now versus even just 10 years ago, it’s so discernibly different and I think that as those costs come down, somebody has to serve that content and our infrastructure... We have the infrastructure to be able to do it, and so for some of us, we have to stay slightly ahead so that we are that place that’s always viewed as quality. So yeah, I guess it has to be part of our DNA that we’re always going to support those cutting-edge formats. We’ve opened the door to AI and I definitely want to talk about that and in particular, using AI as a creative tool, and how your customers might be thinking about that and their relationship to it. But first, I just want to get to the Decoder questions. We’ve talked a lot about how you’re thinking about growing Vimeo’s business. What would you say is the most tangibly different thing you’re doing compared to your predecessor Anjali? There are a couple of things. I think Anjali was supporting a lot of different businesses. I’ll say as you went through covid and as you went through when video was hard… I would say it wasn’t as culturally ingrained as it is right now. She had to make a lot of decisions around the business. When I got here, a lot of people asked me this question: “Well, do we serve the consumer or do we serve the enterprise? Do we serve the filmmaker or do we serve the physician?” When I really spent time with who our customer was, I really had to get deep, deep, deep down inside and go, who really uses us? Show me the type of company, show me the names of the companies, and the industries that we’re in. It was very clear to me that we serve the creator who is professional, somebody who is using video for their business professionally. It’s not a hobby. It’s actually to get a job done. Being able to consensus around that creative pro, not trying to go and create a YouTube competitor or a low-cost tool for the hobbyist, but truly that we serve that professional creator, and then being able to describe very succinctly the fact that all of that comes together. Sometimes a professional creator wants to serve a single video. Sometimes they need to be able to manage thousands of videos. Sometimes they want to be able to go live, sometimes they need a high quality, and sometimes they need help to divide it, to cut it up into rectangular or square formats. I think one of the core things that I did when I got here was really obsess about the customer. Every meeting we start, we start by telling a customer’s story. I learned a lot of this, I would tell you, between Google and Amazon. Amazon is, I would say, renowned for this, but we really tell the stories of who our creators are and then really build the ability to move quickly and listen to those enterprise requirements. When you start a company, and… I started at Microsoft in the very early days of Microsoft. It wasn’t an enterprise company then, believe it or not. Amazon, when I got there, didn’t have a lot of financial services companies using the cloud. I went through that transition. At Google, it wasn’t really known as an enterprise-grade cloud when I first got there. So I’ve been through this transition, and when you start a product that is going to serve the enterprise, what I always tell people is that it’s easier to get more complex, but it’s really hard to be complex and get easier. And so we were starting from these roots as a consumer and filmmaker’s product, and a lot of what I’ve focused on is really listening quickly to not just our individual customers, but the entire spectrum, and being able to say yes to those requirements. I also come with a tremendous amount of experience as you can imagine. You could look at my background — it’s years of enterprise experience, and so, I know what’s required to be able to do HIPAA. I understand how to do General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). I understand compliance requirements. When we go into things like artificial intelligence, or we go into storage and distribution, I have a lot of instincts around that. Spending the time to explain where we’re going as a company, to be able to serve both inside and outside the firewall, and the requirements that we’re going to have architecturally, and just explaining that to the organization and weaving together… Hey, that filmmaker wants their content protected the same way that the largest retailer in the world or the CEO wants their content protected, then weaving those two messages together and building a product roadmap that’s going to serve both. I feel like that’s probably the biggest thing that I’ve done since getting here: unifying the vision into a single cohesive vision. And then the second thing is really making sure that all of us are telling the stories. “Hey, did you know that this fertility clinic is using us in this way? Did you know that this school teacher is using us in this way? Did you know that this faith organization uses us in this way? Do you know that the largest retailer uses us this way?” Getting people to tell the stories internally, I think, was important. The last thing I’ll tell you is that there was a little bit of a shine that came off the company after the IPO. I think, giving the company confidence and saying, “Let me tell you who’s actually using us.” I don’t think that a lot of people really realized, internally even, the broad array of customers we have. I put this in our shareholder letter: we have eight out of the top eight big box retailers. We have eight out of the top eight media companies that are using us internally. We have huge numbers of insurance and financial services companies, companies that could use anybody, and I said they’re using us for a reason. So getting some confidence back into the company that we actually are an incredibly valuable tool in a world of increasing complexity — I think that gives the company a lot more confidence to be even bolder as we go forward. You’re talking a lot about culture change, and renewed focus. The thesis of this show is that that comes out of structure. I’m just looking at our notes here from my producers. In the past few months, you’ve named a new chief marketing officer, a new chief information security officer, a new people officer, and a new chief revenue officer. You’re obviously making some changes in the organization. How was Vimeo structured and how are you restructuring? I think that, in some cases, our technology organizations were incredibly siloed. How we did trust and safety as an example, in some cases how we did data, and who owned which parts of engineering. They were actually broken up in a lot of ways. I think oftentimes our marketing organization had one mandate while the sales organization might’ve had another mandate. A lot of what I would tell you was really important to me… One of my first hires was a chief technology and product officer, Bob Petrocelli. I brought in an individual who unifies product engineering and is able to have single-threaded leadership over top of parts of the business that are that important. They have to be working together well. Some of the things that we’re doing in trust and safety, we actually think we can turn around and expose that to our enterprise customers. It turns out they probably don’t want things on their platform the same way that we don’t want certain things on our platform. So getting any internal function to become an external function and getting that kind of view that we all serve the customer in some way, shape, or form is super important inside of our product and technology organizations. One of the most important things I had to do was bring in our Chief Marketing Officer, Charlie Ungashick, who has really extensive experience marketing to individuals and enterprise. We are going out and talking about how we can protect videos, serve videos, and provide AI to that entire audience. So we had to get an individual who was able to oversee both parts of the business. I’ve also done some recent restructuring where we put an individual completely in charge of what we call our self-service business. To be able to move even faster in that part of the business and obsess on everything from the top of the funnel all the way through when a subscriber comes in, right down to “what are we actually using in the product”… And this is a big element as well. I will tell you one of the other changes I didn’t mention is that we’re obsessing on use right down to the feature level. I look at those reports on a weekly basis, like how many people are using our edit feature, and how many people are using our live feature. How many people applied permissions to a video? Did that increase week over week? What did we do? And so that self-service leader is really now a single-threaded leader, and we also had a single-threaded leader around our streaming business. We really started seeing some of the results from that inside the company. Giving single-threaded leadership, I will tell you it is talked about a lot, but oh my God, it’s beautiful to actually be able to call up somebody that owns the number, that owns the resources, that worries about it as much as you do every single day. Single-threaded leadership is an Amazon concept. You’ve worked at all the companies, so I can pick out where the concepts come from. It’s pretty fun for me. That’s a classic Amazon concept. It is. You need to have a pretty small team that owns the thing and there’s a leader who is responsible for the whole stack. That is how you get silos. You can look at Amazon’s product and say, “Oh, there’s a bunch of single-threaded leaders here.” This is not necessarily cohesive. Everything is running as fast as it can, but the holistic vision of the Amazon product suffers for it at scale, right? You started out talking about having too many silos and we’re talking about single-threaded leaders. How are you managing that tension? I was asked one time to give a talk on what it was like to work at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. I got an opportunity to work directly with Gates, Ballmer, Jassy, and then certainly with Thomas Curry and Sundar Pichai. One of the most important lessons I learned very early on at Microsoft was about really establishing a strong single-sentence vision for the entire company about what we’re trying to do in the future. And you wake up every single morning and I mean… I was there in the early days when the vision was a PC on every desktop in every home. That was extraordinary at the time. Now we have a PC in every pocket, but we all knew that what we were trying to do was unlock information for the world by putting this powerful computing device in someone’s hands. And so regardless of the divisions or otherwise, it all feathered into a common vision. It was a lot of what I had to do when I got here. I owed the company a strong agreement among everybody in the company about what we’re trying to build. Are we trying to build the best livestream product? Are we trying to build the best marketing platform? Are we trying to build a product for filmmakers? We settled on this common vision and then we’re able to say, “Okay, this is the individual that owns this part of the business.” There’s a huge portion of our individual business where people swipe a credit card and start using us or register for free. A huge number of those customers actually end up as enterprise customers. I called up one of the top retailers and started talking to him about Vimeo and he said, “Well, first of all,” he goes, “You don’t have to tell me who you are.” He goes, “My son is on Vimeo every weekend. He’s an independent filmmaker.” He goes, “So I know who you are, but why are you calling me?” And I said, “Well, we have 2,600 accounts, self-service accounts that are on [our platform]. We should do an enterprise agreement.” So being able to explain to the organization how the two sides work together and being able to make decisions in a room between where we’re applying more features may be in one part of the business or another… And how those features actually feather, how we might start them for an individual, but they have to grow to work for an entire enterprise — is all really, really important. Starting with a strong vision that everybody buys into, that they understand their piece of it, is really critical. And then for each one of those leaders, I expect them to have a strong vision for how they’re going to contribute to the overall vision. That’s another important thing. You can’t let their vision exist in the absence of the rest of the company’s vision, so you have to actively stitch those visions together. You brought up decisions. That’s the other classic Decoder question. I will warn you: this is a honeypot for former Amazon executives. When you ask Amazon executives how they make decisions, everybody sings chapter and verse, but you’ve worked at a bunch of places. You are now the CEO of this company. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? The other company I didn’t talk about that I learned a lot from was Google. One of the things that I would tell you Google gave me was that they managed something like 10 out of the top 11 billion-user products in the world and were really thinking big. Actually giving an organization incredibly lofty goals, and sometimes you only reach 80–90 percent of them. One of the things that I do first and foremost is — that I really am a believer in — that you’ve got to set these very high goals. You need to have this vision and you need to be willing to put yourself out there to set extremely high goals. And then back into that from a decision-making process, I would tell you that we’ve made a number of decisions around which products we focus on, which areas we deprecate. I come back to the customer. One of the things I really try to hold people accountable to, and I think it’s really important, I learned a lot of this both at Google and at Amazon, but actually explaining the customer problem that we’re trying to solve. And there are all kinds of studies that you can do. There are user studies, data studies, and so forth, but truly being able to assess what that workflow looks like. What are we trying to solve? What is the most challenging thing for the customer? What is actually frustrating the customer most? And really having a strong sense for your customer and the customer anecdotes as well as what we call... At Google, we called it customer empathy, actually putting yourself in the shoes of the customer. One of the things that we ask everyone inside of Vimeo to do is be a user of the product. So the things that are frustrating us, we are elevating those into our decision-making process. We both bring the voice of the customer in and, we bring our own voice in, and then we also are saying, “Okay, well what’s going to help us grow? What’s going to grow the next million users for us or what’s going to grow us to 10X?” So I can’t just tell you it’s one thing. It’s a little bit of a framework of the customer, making sure we’re tethered to big ideas and really making sure that we’re being innovative enough in how we push the team. Well, I applaud you for being the only former Amazon executive to not talk about one-way and two-way doors when I ask that. You’ve done it, you’ve achieved escape velocity. I mean, I appreciate the one-way and two-way doors. I’m just saying. No, I get it. I don’t know if I’d buy that. The thing I do love, I mean, at Google, I think they’ve proven that there’s not a lot of one-way doors. Fair enough. Google’s interesting. We’ve talked a lot about YouTube during this conversation. Vimeo has come out against YouTube. You have entire blog posts about how your search capabilities are better than YouTube’s search capabilities or how Vimeo is a better platform. You’ve talked, even in this episode, about wanting things to be private, not being part of the algorithmic ecosystem or the advertising ecosystem on YouTube. Google is big. They think so big that sometimes they let opportunities just slide away because they think at such a massive scale. How are you thinking about competing with YouTube at that scale when they seem to own so much of the attention, space, and video? I don’t think that a lot of product companies love the fact that you have to go to YouTube to get some customer support for one of their products. Meanwhile, one of their competitors could be rolling right next to you. And I think that when I look at YouTube… I was at Google and spent a lot of time with customers, and I really foundationally believe... I love YouTube, I’ll watch YouTube as much as the next person. I think that what they’re doing for, I’ll call it the attention economy, for what they’re doing around content, for democratizing access to more and more content — I think it’s absolutely wonderful. And quite frankly, as I said, a lot of our customers are great YouTube customers as well. People will house their videos on Vimeo and post on YouTube in a lot of ways. But I really do think that there is… In the same way that you don’t do a lot of your business on Facebook or you don’t do it on LinkedIn, you kind of do it behind closed walls. I think that a lot of the economy runs behind firewalls and paywalls. So I think that we can go directly at that. The other thing I’m going to say is… Think about what happened in content and why some of these platforms rose. Think about, and again, I’m old enough to remember MSN and AOL — the reason why we went there was because news had to be consolidated. It was hard to create websites. It was difficult to find information, it had to be curated. Well, Netflix and YouTube were born in an era where it was really hard to categorize content to say, “Hey, this video is about a cat,” or “This video is about how to plug an HDMI cord into the back of your LG TV.” And so there was categorization that had to take place. There was standardization of the data, the metadata, and then recommendations engines. I don’t know if you remember, but Netflix famously paid a million dollars to be able to write their recommendation engine. They went out and said, “Whoever builds the best recommendation engine will win a million dollars.” Well, with an AI model, I can categorize content in seconds now. With a recommendation engine, I can buy recommendation engines off the shelf. And quite frankly, the metadata that we can produce now out of a video is extraordinarily more detailed than a human being can even write. I can tell you precisely when the purse left the beach, who was carrying the purse, and what brand of shoes the individual was wearing. All stuff that may be missed when a human being has to enter all that metadata. And so what I see is that there is going to be a democratization of content classification, content recommendation, and context discoverability. I think that there are searches… There is a single search place that you go to be able to get your content, videos, and maps, and pick your favorite things. But I think that there are billions of dollars going into discovering other ways to find and interact with information. And so I think that Vimeo can serve that kind of information outside of a traditional Google search in a lot of ways, whether or not you’re on an intranet inside of a company, whether or not you’re inside an AI model and you don’t want to leave the ecosystem of the AI model. We can provide an answer to a question as well. I think YouTube is fantastic, I love it, but I think that for the discoverability, accessibility, indexing, and recommendations, there’s a whole new era coming and we intend to be a part of it. There’s another piece of that dynamic that I’m wondering if you are considering, which is that Google is a huge company that is under an enormous amount of pressure right now. Maybe it’s so much pressure that it will be hard for the company to execute. There’s an antitrust trial in this country that resulted in the government suggesting Google break itself up and sell Chrome. There’s Donald Trump in the mix, who may or may not make some sort of deal. There’s a Donald Trump in the mix who’s done a tariffs regime with China that resulted in a Chinese antitrust investigation of Google — which is amazing because Google doesn’t really operate in that country. Europe exists, much to the chagrin of many of our tech companies. There’s just a lot going on. There’s a lot of pressure on Google to not flex that dominance. And then there’s competitive pressure from the AI products, like ChatGPT, SearchGPT, and Bing — to whatever extent that Microsoft believes that Bing is a real competitor to Google. Does that create an opening for you? Do you see that as a real opening or is that just well, if those doors open, you’ll be ready? I have a lot of friends at Google. I really enjoyed my time there. I don’t wish them ill in any way, and I really hope that they sail through this era of challenge for them in a really great way. Clearly, I came here from Google because I saw the opportunity. I really did see the opportunity that… We’re about to go through a seismic shift in the accessibility of information with new ways to go and access it. Whether or not you’re using ChatGPT, Anthropic, or Mistral, there are so many different ways to be able to discover information. The notion of the common crawl on the web, the ability to be able to crawl the whole web, index it, and then to be able to ingest it into these models shows that it’s democratizing access to that information discovery. Video is a very important element of video, and I think you’d agree. You can’t just imagine only one platform is going to serve all the video answers in the world, and so that’s where I see it’s such a super opportunity for us at Vimeo. Let’s talk about AI. I want to start by asking a mathematical question. One of my theses for the year is that the creator economy is under an enormous amount of pressure. Not just from AI, but also from what you’re describing: this huge shift to video. You can see that there’s just an exponential increase in the supply of video on all these platforms. More and more kids are making videos. More and more people are choosing to communicate in video-first ways. More enterprises are doing it. And then you have AI, which is just making it easier and easier to produce a massive amount of video. So the platforms are getting flooded with supply. There’s not as much ad revenue as there is an increase in video supply, so you do the division and you’re like, well, the ad rates are going to go down, and then attention is sort of fixed. There are only so many people with so many hours in a day, and presumably, people do have to eat and do productive work. So attention is kind of fixed, right? It’s just like a fixed number that you can capture. That all just seems like it’s a bubble that’s going to pop. You flood an ecosystem that has been pretty stable for a few years with an enormous amount of supply, the ad rates go down, and attention stays fixed. Something happens in there, and it seems like, to me, AI is the most important component of that because it’s the thing that can change the economics of the supply the fastest. You just say, “Make 50 videos about my product,” and now we have 50 videos about the product on whatever platform. Is that an opportunity for you? That this whole creator economy, or the video creator economy as we know it, seems like it’s going to have a pretty basic shift in its economics? That’s a huge question. To me, it is the question of 2025 — if you asked me, “What is The Verge doing in 2025?” There’s Elon Musk and DOGE, and then there’s what happens to the creator economy. I think with the creator economy, we are reaching saturation. I mean, think of your own experience. I don’t know when we’re going to get to the post-mobile phone era, but this is not a way we’re going to live for the rest of eternity as human beings. And so on the creator’s side, yes, I think that there is a saturation point, but I also think that people are looking for a little bit of a higher quality experience. I think people are getting tired of the doom scrolling. I think the mere fact that we name it, the fact that we are now acknowledging that we get sent down rabbit holes... I do think people will like storytelling. And I do think there’s going to be really different opportunities. I get asked all the time, “When will AI be able to take my favorite book and turn it into a movie?” And now, think about that. Think about how wonderful that would be. Think about being able to take your child’s favorite book and turn it into a video for them that has an extended storyline. I think storytelling is as old as humanity and it’s going to continue forward and so I do — Can I just stop you there for one second? I know the Decoder audience fairly well. A lot of people just started screaming at you in their car because they think that’s a bad outcome. Do you think that’s a bad outcome? I have a young child. The idea that we’re going to read The Wild Robot and then some AI tool is going to make the movie The Wild Robot instead of the beautiful actual movie made by people, The Wild Robot — I would argue that that’s a bad outcome. I think it is for a class. Here’s what bugs me the most right now. Last year the big six studios only put out 88 movies. 88. Right, because the economics of video have collapsed on them. They don’t have a distribution monopoly. Exactly, and I think there are so many stories to be told. If the creator of The Wild Robot gets paid for having a movie and is able to be monetized in some shape or form, in a really beautiful way, I actually think we’re supporting storytellers in a foundational way. I think that that’s a decade away. I would say maybe five to seven years away. And so first and foremost, I do think that AI is going to help people create more stories. I think they are. I think they’re going to be able to illustrate more stories, let’s put it that way. I talk to a lot of creative types who tell me, “Look, AI is fairly disjointed right now. It’s indeterministic. I don’t know what I’m going to get out of it.” Human curation of AI creation is going to be a necessity, in the same way that shooting on a green screen and then being able to put in a background for a movie is indeterministic until the human being decides what’s on that green screen. What I’m saying is that I do think that longer-form stories are going to be more compelling. I think people are going to want to stay inside of a story a little bit longer. That doesn’t mean that the creator is going away. It doesn’t mean human curation is going away. I just think that we’re going to be able to tell more beautiful stories in more ways. So I’ll park there because we are pro-creator, we are pro-filmmaker, and we serve a lot of them. They’re not going away. We’re going to uplift them and make them faster. I think this is a real tension, and I see it expressed all the time. I’ve heard it from your peers on the show when they tell me about the tools that people use in Photoshop, right? Generative fill in Photoshop, according to Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen, is like a hundred percent usage rate. But then, everyone yells about generative fill existing, and there’s a real mismatch between consumer expectations and how people feel about AI, and then about the creatives actually using the tools at high rates. I get all that. I also think there’s a mismatch between you saying you’re for filmmakers and how marketers want to use AI. I think we’re careening towards a world of basically custom creative being shown to individual users. [A world] where some brand uploads their assets to a video platform and ads get assembled for you in AI. For you, a specific user, [to get] ads targeted to your interests. We’re headed there and the big platform’s already talking about it. But those really commercial uses of AI — “we’re going to make a whole bunch of ads and we’re going to do some of the most creative filmmaking that exists” — they don’t seem like they’re happening at the same rate or with the same level of acceptance, or even like they should happen with the same tools, and you have every piece of the puzzle in front of you. Where do you see the biggest growth and where do you see the biggest pushback? One of our creators, Jake Oleson, recently shot Currents for Apple Vision Pro. And when you shoot for an Apple Vision Pro, you have to maintain perfect stillness in the camera. You’ll shoot four to six cameras and by hand, you have to stitch all these things together. If you get an opportunity to watch Currents, it’s absolutely stunning. You kind of look at it and go, “Oh my God, I’ve seen the future of filmmaking. I truly have.” And I do think that this is where I say that I think we’re going to get into a post-mobile phone era for watching content and creativity. And I think that we’ll experience film in new ways. We’ll experience stories in new ways. And I think that I’m seeing the best creators blend together the content and AI usage with traditional techniques to make something incredible. Most filmmakers that I talk to start with something they’ve shot and then enhance it with AI. One of the things that is most interesting to me is that, in the marketing world, the thing that’s taking off the most right now are not avatars (and avatars, I like to call them… like nobody wants to talk to a robot), it’s actually people that are sitting there going, “Hey, I just bought this piece of furniture. This looks really cool. Let me show you what it looks like inside of my house.” Actually, authenticity in a world of robots I think is actually... I’m already seeing it. We offered to a number of our customers, “Hey, would you like us to do some avatars?” And then we also offered to them, “Hey, we have this super down-and-dirty create tool where you can record, we can put a teleprompter up in front of you so you can do your own script. And we can either make the avatar look perfect or you can be sitting in your living room and do this quick thing about your product or about your service.” And inevitably, all of them go to the real human being doing this. I’m just going to tell you point blank: I’m not seeing the robots take off. I’m not seeing it. And we’ve tried to serve both. I think that humans have always risen above. They’ve always brought authenticity. They’ve always brought through how you kind of know when you’re getting something and when you’re not. Even in the chatbot world, how many people get frustrated when they’re talking to a chatbot online? They quickly want to talk to a human being. I don’t know how to say it to you, but we sense that there are no ghosts in the machine. So I don’t know how to say it to you any other way. I studied artificial intelligence for a long time and I’m very confident in the beauty of the human soul in the context of creativity. I feel like I’m more cynical than you, but I spend more time on social platforms, it feels like. And the problem, generally, is you can sense it. Some people can feel it, and a lot of people cannot, right? Or they just let it wash over them and then you end up in sort of interminable fights about metadata or labeling. Google just rolled out SynthID for images that you edit in Google Photos. None of that stuff seems to have landed. It has certainly not landed in a universal way. Vimeo has some labeling features. You have some ideas about how you might show people AI-generated content or expose that metadata to people. Do you think that’s working? Is that something you’re going to continue? Is that something that you think needs to be expanded? When I was at Google, there were about 42 different regulatory bodies that were working on AI legislation. The last we checked, there are over one thousand on a worldwide basis. And I’m raising that to say that when you do translations in certain states inside of the United States, like Illinois or Texas, you can’t actually modify people’s lips and put words in their mouths, so that’s just one of the regulations. Over in Europe, you actually do have to identify that something’s been AI-enhanced or modified. So I do think that we as humanity are wrestling with it when we want to know that something’s not real. The mere fact that that’s coming from all over the world, that you’re seeing the desire to know when something’s not real, I can’t say whether or not that’s good or bad, but I can tell you that it’s actually a human desire. And so, getting something done like changing the credit card on my telephone bill, I’ll deal with a bot to do that. But if I’m really having a problem, or my elderly father-in-law is having a problem, I actually do want a human being to pick up the phone and just talk him through it. I guess what I’d say to you is… I think in filmmaking as well, we’ve always used tools to tell our story. It’s been the invention of so many tools to help us tell stories. AI is just another tool to help us tell the stories. I would certainly like to know when characters aren’t real. I guess this is the hardest question. This is an existentially philosophical question, but: Where do you draw the line? Where do you personally think the line should be for when you have to put the label on something? I’ll give you two examples. I think when I stabilize a video with AI, that does not require it. I think if I’m talking to a deepfake avatar, or a creator that is photorealistic, that is just lying to me, that situation probably requires it, right? I’ve replaced products in this movie with other products and that may require it. Where do you think the line is? I think that I haven’t been asked this question before, but as I reflect on it, I would like to know that a particular character, animal, or something that’s in the film is actually not real — that it’s completely made up. Now you can tell that in animation, but in a real film, if I know that a certain character or a certain scene is actually completely fabricated with a single individual in it, I probably would like to know that. Or when there’s dialogue involved where something’s talking back to me that’s not for real, I probably want to know about it. When I look at some of the Marvel movies, clearly you start crossing the line. Well, does the fox in Guardians of the Galaxy do it? We all know the fox is- The latest Marvel movie they just announced is Fantastic Four, and they made the poster with AI, and there’s fan backlash to it. So I’m just wondering if you see the norms moving faster than the technology, or slower? You are shipping these products and you have such a direct line to creators, so it feels like you’re caught up right in the middle of where we put the labels. The thing that really does bother me right now is the influencers that don’t even exist. If I’m looking at something that’s clearly animated, I’m okay with it. I would love to know that somebody’s voice was actually used for real by that individual. So it’s going to be complex and I wonder out loud, will we stop caring, and at what point? Will we become comfortable that basically the whole thing is simply animated because that’s really what we’re talking about? We’re just creating animation that’s higher and higher fidelity in a lot of ways. But I think it should probably be noted that, at some point, the human doesn’t exist. I feel like that’s probably where I’d cross the line, or that dog doesn’t actually exist, especially if the dog’s a main character. So you might end up doing it based on the classification of the importance of the character and whether or not there’s actual, true existence there. And how much modification was done to the individual based on the class of character in the story? I asked that question three different ways and pushed on it again because it feels like the pressure on the creator economy and the social platforms is just going to go up. With Meta, Mark Zuckerberg is out there openly saying, “We will have AI content in people’s social feeds on Facebook and Instagram.” How they choose to label it, whether or not the mean dogs have labels — I don’t know. I don’t know what Mark Zuckerberg is going to do. No one can see into his soul, but it’s pretty obvious that if he could get a bunch more cute cat videos on Facebook using AI, he’s going to do it. It’s obvious why he would do that. Does that create an opportunity for you to say Vimeo is for real content or real people? Is that something you would lean into? Because you do have the AI tools. When you open the website today, it says you’re an AI-powered video platform. There’s a lot of conflation between “we can do better classification and with better recommendations” and “we can do better marketing videos and we’re going to steal everyone’s data and make cat videos for Facebook attention spans.” I think as I sit here and think about protecting the Vimeo brand, I aspire to actually be the place that people trust. When I first got here, we were approached to basically crawl our content and it was like as many companies were approached… We talked to the creators and the creators said, “Listen, don’t replace us. Just uplift us and protect us. Make sure that Vimeo is always a place where we’re protected and that’s why we come to you and that’s why we want to continue to come to you.” So we made a decision not to allow that crawling, and then shortly thereafter we had to say, “Anytime you use AI on Vimeo, we’re going to actually guarantee that none of the AI models will improve based on your usage of it.” Unless you say, “Improve based on my usage, like understanding my storyline, my filters, my dialogue, or my style of dialogue,” we’ll do that for you as an individual creator. We’ll create your own private AI. We were actually approached as well to say, “Listen, we need you.” A number of the creators said, “We want you to help us identify when content has been generated by AI.” We do a lot of business over in the EU, and so we said, “Yes, we’re going to do that as well.” The thing that I describe about AI… Back in the era of the production line, humans stopped being able to keep up in a lot of ways, and so we started creating robots. We started creating machines that turned on screws and so forth. And next year at this time, there’s going to be more information created in the next year than there has in the history of mankind coming up until this point. Humans are struggling to keep up with a production line of information. So we’ve invented these machines. I also think AI is going to help us identify these things. It will help us filter and help us be able to say, “This is AI generated,” or “This content cannot be verified from the source.” We have to do some work around what we call KYC or know your creator. In some jurisdictions that we operate in, we have to actually say, “Yes, this is a human being that created this, this is the company that created this.” I actually think we have an opportunity to serve as that — like “Yes, this was created by a real human,” which actually stands out in a world of robots. So I think there are a lot of opportunities to protect the viewer and the creator, as well as serve them in helping produce stories faster. I want to ask one more foundational question about AI. There’s a lot of talk about cost right now in the AI world. There’s DeepSeek, which might have brought down the cost of training. There’s an argument about whether the cost of inference will drop. At the same time, Sam Altman is saying he’s going to build $500 billion worth of data centers all around the world with SoftBank. You use these tools, right? You’re deploying these tools against some large data sets in video, which is where the costs tend to go up the fastest. Where do you think that is? Is that working out for you? Are you making more money on the use of AI than you’re spending on it right now? The short answer is yes. I would tell you that I expect the cost of inference to drop dramatically. We were experimenting with some of the exact same things that DeepSeek claimed to do, to be able to use really low-cost chips to be able to do inference. And I do expect inference… the cost of inference is going to go through the floor. I used to joke to say, “If I need to order a Frosty and a double burger at Wendy’s, I don’t need to wade through all of Taylor Swift’s boyfriends and songs to be able to get through that.” So distillations of models to be able to serve at the exact moment of time that’s necessary, whatever the language or the function is. I think that you’re going to see that distillation will help us with this. The most recent Blackwell chips from Nvidia were about four times more efficient. Lighter weight models are super important to us. So we’re going to solve a lot of the inference problems and the cost associated with inference. I’m seeing it drop dramatically for what we do, and so it’ll be very manageable over time. I think that the real big cost for a lot of these companies is the training of some of this stuff, and that is going to come in line as well. We’ll get to a point of diminishing returns, like do you really need to go to 10 trillion-parameter models, or do you need something that’s just lighter weight to be able to do chemistry, biology, security, or coloration, as an example? I think, right now, we’re in the era of big models, and I don’t think that’ll last. Do you think we need to spend $500 billion on data centers all around the world? We need to lay down a new infrastructure of silicon. The silicon that’s around the world right now is highly optimized for general compute, and this is a new mathematical model that has to be supported with silicon. Otherwise, we’d actually consume more power if we didn’t have specialized chips that run this math equation. So all that’s happening right now is that, yes, we need to run our current compute and now we have a new algorithm we have to run. We’re going to need optimized silicon to be able to run that extra algorithm. So the short answer is that we actually do have to duplicate the silicon around the world. Is that something that you can drive at Vimeo? We talked about needing to serve 8K and the price of storage and compute for those falling on a pretty predictable basis. We need to invent new silicon to support AI workloads. That’s like a whole industry effort, right? And the pressure is all on maybe a handful of companies in one foundry to pull that off. How do you make those bets? I would tell you that we’re doing a lot in evaluating quality across a whole spectrum. One of the things that, as I said to you at the very start, we’re obsessing about is how our creators really want to use AI. They don’t want to be replaced and all this. And so what we’re doing is we’re picking each one of these areas and actually establishing quality frameworks inside of Vimeo — I almost said Google — inside of Vimeo where we’re saying, “Hey, this is high-quality translation,” or, “This is what we need to do to be able to support understanding what changed frame to frame.” And so a lot of what we’re doing is that we’re saying, “Okay, what’s the best model for the job that our creators are going to need to get done?” And then under the surface, we’re stitching all that together so the creator doesn’t even know there might be multiple models that are supporting them. We’ve established quality and then also handoffs for that creator because, as I said to you, we’re creating AI that’s going to be unique to that creator. And so we’re going to remember whether it’s over here in the translation world, over in asking a question, indexing, or otherwise. We stitch it all together for the creator so they don’t even know that we might be using multiple AI, but it’s establishing quality bars for each one of those things. And then also economics — making sure we get the best economics and best performance, like queries per second from the model providers for that area so they can serve our massive minutes of video and number of creators. We’re managing performance, cost, and quality on behalf of the creator across multiple models. Well, Philip, as you can probably tell, I could talk to you forever, but we are out of time. What’s next for Vimeo? Give people a preview of what’s coming up next and we’ll let you get out of here. I’m probably most excited right now, as I mentioned to you, about the massive formats that are coming at the creator. I’m super excited about what can be done with immersive formats. I’m also starting to see a lot of people who want to go back into these sphere-like experiences. I do think that that’s going to be exciting and you’ll see us continue to push the edge there. You’re going to see us invest more in the filmmaking community. Literally on Monday, I’m headed over to the Berlin Film Festival after hopefully, my Philadelphia Eagles do well in the Super Bowl. So you’re going to see us do even more around staff picks and celebrating filmmakers in every geography we serve around the world. I mean, it’s been fairly US-centric, and you’re going to see us get a lot more global in supporting filmmakers. Also, I would tell you as we look over at our enterprise customers, we think we can support customers in their customer journey. This mass proliferation of video across every part of the organization in the service of customers. We’re going to do really well at just-in-time video serving just the right video to just the right person at just the right moment of the customer interaction. So you’ll see us really come out with some exciting things about that between the format and the AI, things we can do to transform storytelling. Amazing. Well, we’ll have to have you back when we do just-in-time immersive video, AKA to both eyes at the same time. Phil, thanks. That’d be amazing. Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode?

Title: Week Ahead: Busy Week On Wall Street

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 16: People walk past the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 16, 2023 ... [+] in New York City. Stocks fell again in morning trading as investors continue to show concerns over the stability of global banks following the collapse last week of Silicon Valley Bank. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Wall Street kicks off the final week of February 2025, investors are bracing for a busy week of data. I watch the news but I pay more attention to how the market reacts to the news. Remember, there are only three ways the market can move: up, down or sideways. A market that can’t fall on bearish news is bullish. The opposite is also true. Moreover, we all make (and or lose) money based on one thing: change in price. If the price moves in our favor (up if we are long and down if we are short) than we make money. If the price moves against us, we lose money. Everything else, including the latest headlines du jour comes second. For me, that’s why the reaction to the news matters more than the news itself. That doesn’t mean the news doesn’t matter, it does. The key is to focus on how the market reacts to the news and adjust accordingly. First, let’s look at the day-to-day breakdown and some of the big events happening this week: Monday, February 24: Earnings season keeps rolling with Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Owens Corning (OC), and Zoom Communications (ZM) reporting. Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) is also on tap—could give us a read on industrial demand. No major economic data today, so the focus is on these corporate updates. Tuesday, February 25: Big day—Home Depot (HD) reports, offering a window into consumer spending and housing trends. We’ve also got American Tower (AMT), Intuit (INTU), and Workday (WDAY). Plus, February Consumer Confidence drops—last month it hit a low, so any bounce could lift spirits. Wednesday, February 26: Heavyweight day for tech and retail—Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM), and Snowflake (SNOW) report, which could swing the Nasdaq. Lowe’s (LOW) and TJX (TJX) give us more consumer clues. January New Home Sales data lands too—watch for housing momentum. Thursday, February 27: GDP second estimate for Q4 hits, alongside durable goods and pending home sales for January. On the earnings front, Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), and Autodesk (ADSK) report—tech’s still in the spotlight. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and TD Bank (TD) could signal financial sector health. Friday, February 28: Is the last trading day in February. We wrap the week with January PCE price index—the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—plus personal income and spending data. Earnings from Chart Industries (GTLS) and Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) close out a busy earnings week. Markets will be digesting all this ahead of the weekend. Political News: Second, let’s step back and look at the different news that we expect to hit the tape this week. First, we have the always fun political news. Investors will want to see the latest developments and what will happen with tariffs. Last month, Canada and Mexico managed to get a one month extension. Investors will want to see if they get another extension or if they can reach a deal to get rid of tariffs. In early February, U.S. stocks sold off after the tariffs were announced. We’ll see what happens in March. Economic News: Next up we have a flurry of economic news. As mentioned above, on Tuesday we have the Consumer Confidence Index. That will offer a fresh perspective on household optimism, a critical driver of consumer spending. It is important to note that consumer spending makes up over 75% of the economy. That’s why focusing on the consumer is important to make sense of what the rest of 2025 will look like. On Wednesday, Nvidia reports earnings and we will get more economic data. Nvidia is considered the big artificial intelligence darling on Wall Street. If it gaps up and rallies, that will bode well for other AI and tech stocks. On the other hand, if it rolls over and falls, that could put pressure on the market. On the economic front, durable goods orders are going to be released. That could signal whether businesses are ramping up spending or cutting back. Thursday brings international news with preliminary inflation figures from major Eurozone economies: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, among others. Inflation has been public enemy #1 for many global central banks so that will be important going forward. We also have the second estimate for U.S. GDP. In the U.S., we get a sneak peak at inflation on Friday when the Personal Consumption Expenditures data is announced. The PCE is one of the important metrics the Federal Reserve looks at each month. We will also get the personal income and spending figures; a hotter-than-expected PCE could cut hopes for near-term rate cuts, while slowing spending might hint at an economic slowdown. Together, these releases will test the narrative of a robust U.S. economy against lingering inflation risks, offering clues on whether stocks can sustain their lofty heights or face a reality check. What It Means For Investors Investors will want to see who will win this week, the bulls or the bears. If we get a big up week, that means the bulls win. Conversely, if we roll over and see more selling pressure (a.k.a. distribution) show up, the bears will emerge victorious. As February draws to a close, this week’s heavy data and earnings will test global markets. Bulls will point to resilient earnings and lower central-bank rates as fuel for further gains; bears will highlight inflation risks and policy uncertainty. By Friday’s close, we’ll have a clearer picture of what the rest of 2025 may look like. As always, it is never a dull moment on Wall Street.

Title: An advanced degree was once viewed as the best path toward job security. It's now proving to be a liability.

What did you do last week? Sorry to be so blunt, but federal workers are grappling with that question. DOGE sent an email this weekend asking government employees to list their recent accomplishments before midnight tonight. Many told BI they feel frustrated by the request. The Department of Defense, meanwhile, instructed staff not to respond. In today's big story, getting an advanced degree was once viewed as the best path toward job security. Now, it's proving to be a liability on your résumé. What's on deck Markets: The takeaways from Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. Tech: A former big-time Elon Musk believer makes the case for why Tesla is in trouble this year. Business: The Russian media oligarch pushing Putin to even further extremes. But first, school's out forever. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Their degrees were something for them to fall back on. Instead, they're in a free fall. Job seekers with advanced degrees are having a much harder time finding work compared to their less-educated peers, writes Business Insider's Aki Ito. These days, you're better off with just a high school diploma instead of a Ph.D. if you want to find work fast. People who didn't go to college can get work twice as quickly as those with advanced degrees. (Let's be clear: Advanced-degree holders still largely rule the roost on compensation. But pay only matters once you have a job.) Aki has previously written about the struggles of white-collar workers thanks to hiring reductions among tech and finance firms. Those are common landing spots for people with advanced degrees, which might be why extra education isn't paying off in the job hunt. However, Aki's story explores whether the labor market's latest shift could signal a bigger change in the importance of education. All of this is also happening at a time when colleges are facing a reckoning. Some say you can't put a price on education, but universities have certainly tried. With the cost of a four-year degree at a private college easily surpassing $250,000, more and more young people are questioning the benefits of college, let alone grad school. Another corner of the job market that was once a sure thing is also getting shaken up. Government jobs, traditionally considered a stable paycheck with good benefits, have been upended by the Trump administration. (Just reread the intro to this newsletter if you need a recent example.) Tens of thousands of employees took buyouts, and thousands of probationary workers were fired during the first month of the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-cutting efforts.It's still unclear the impact these job cuts will have on the wider labor market. But continuing to make wholesale changes to the largest employer in the US, which is known for its job security, will likely have some residual effect. 1. Warren Buffett's tax bill was a doozy. Berkshire Hathaway, the legendary investor's conglomerate, paid a record $26.8 billion in taxes last year, Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. It's the most paid by any US company in history and represents about 5% of total American corporate income taxes paid in 2024. "Spend it wisely," Buffett wrote. The letter also included some more fundamental business — and life — lessons, too. 2. The meme coin explosion. Once an obscure corner of crypto, meme coins have taken on a life — and market — of their own. But scams are common with meme coins, and ongoing conversations about a regulatory path are another big question mark. 3. How a hedge fund repays $1.2 billion to investors heading for the exits. The past few years have been rocky for Paloma Partners, posting just a 2.5% return in 2024. The multistrategy hedge fund said last fall it would take time to repay departing investors. To meet redemption requests, Paloma plans to pull $600 million from hedge funds it backed, including the quant firm Aquatic Capital, according to four people familiar with the matter. 1. An early Tesla investor is now bearish on the stock. Ross Gerber was among the first to spot Tesla's potential, but he isn't feeling so confident now. Gerber doubts the company can achieve Full Self-Driving on time without switching hardware, and he believes Elon Musk has too many pots in the fire. 2. We're hiring … just not humans. Originally created as an experiment, two founders built a jobs board for AI agents. The jobs board, dubbed "Job for Agent," provides insight into what companies might look for in an AI workforce. 3. AI bosses feel the pressure. In a recent interview, the CEOs of Google DeepMind and Anthropic spoke about the weight of responsibility that comes with ushering in AI. The leaders urged people to better grasp the real force for change they expect AI to be — and for societies to start planning accordingly. 1. The oligarch who wants to "Make Russia Great Again." There is one Russian nationalist currently in the spotlight who may be even more zealous than Vladimir Putin. Konstantin Malofeyev operates Tsargrad, a multimedia platform with over three million followers. He embraces Trumpian rhetoric and helped organize the Russian separatist rebellion in Ukraine's Donbas region, paving the way for Putin's invasion. But Malofeyev thinks Putin isn't doing enough to crush Ukraine. 2. Scaredy-cat capitalism in the new Trump era. While deregulation and tax cuts are generally favored by corporate America, Trump and his policies aren't exactly predictable. That's leading some companies — from Meta to Disney — to brace for his whims. Many businesses are trying to get in Trump's good graces by cutting back on DEI and handing over a check. 3. You might be waiting on your tax return this year. The Internal Revenue Service began firing probationary workers last week who were not "critical" to tax filing season. These terminations are part of Trump's efforts to slash the federal workforce, but it could result in more backlogs, slower customer service, and delayed refunds, tax experts and IRS employees told BI. An IRS HR employee said the firings, coupled with a hiring freeze, could set the agency behind on its functions well into 2026.

Title: Apple braces for DEI showdown at annual shareholder meeting

Apple is set to face a showdown with shareholders this week as it prepares to defend its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies against critical opponents in its investor base. The iPhone maker is scheduled to meet investors Tuesday at its annual shareholder meeting, where a vote is expected on a motion put forward by the National Center for Public Policy Research to cease DEI efforts. The organization, a conservative think tank in Washington, DC, argued that US Supreme Court cases had called into question the legality of corporate DEI programs, putting employers at risk of discrimination claims. Apple, the world's most valuable company, said in a filing that it would oppose the proposal because it "inappropriately attempts" to restrict how the company manages its operations. It comes at a time when its Big Tech counterparts have been rolling back DEI initiatives. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg's Meta announced it would cut its DEI programs. The company told employees that the "legal and policy landscape" around DEI efforts in the US was changing. Other companies that have rolled back programs include Google, which said this month that it would no longer pursue hiring goals based on DEI, and Amazon, which has changed references about DEI benefits on some of its websites. Though some companies began shifting focus away from DEI before the election, several tech leaders have recently reacted to President Donald Trump's deeming DEI efforts "wasteful." Apple's decision to stand by its DEI policies could weigh on its relationship with the president. CEO Tim Cook has tried to build a good rapport with Trump, visiting his Mar-a-Lago resort in December. On Monday, Apple announced a plan to hire about 20,000 people over the next four years as part of a commitment to invest more than $500 billion in US projects. Apple is a rare holdout among tech firms stepping back from DEI initiatives. Large shareholders in its investor base, such as BlackRock, have kept a distance from activist campaigns. Shareholder proposals don't always end up on a company's ballot. A review by the consultancy ISS-Corporate found that proposals against ESG policies, including those against DEI, that came to a vote had garnered little support in the past three years. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

Title: Where Germany Goes From Here

Time Published: 2025-02-24T13:00:16Z

It is salutary to remember that the man set to take over Germany has not had any role in government. Friedrich Merz, whose Christian Democrats won a comfortable if unconvincing victory in Sunday’s elections, will form a government at a time of tumult on multiple fronts. He faces an economy reeling from a decade of under-investment and entering its third year of recession, an immigration crisis exacerbated by a series of lone terror attacks, and the ever-growing popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Most of all it is facing the unprecedented collapse of relations with the U.S., on whom Germans have relied on for security since the end of World War Two. Read More: Exclusive: Alice Weidel on Her Far-Right AfD Party’s Rise, Elon Musk’s Support, and the German Election Merz would see himself as a classic Conservative of the old school, somewhere perhaps between Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, a believer in traditional social values and the established security and political architecture of the postwar era that has bound Germans into the Transatlantic alliance. When Donald Trump was re-elected U.S. President in November, Merz was confident he could do business with him—two fist-pumping men who wanted to slash bureaucracy, cut taxes, and wage war on “woke.” Yet the confrontational approach of Trump’s lieutenants at the recent Munich Security Conference—in which they lauded praise on the AfD—has changed that. The 69-year-old Merz—a man who has interspersed politics with boardroom life as Chairman of the German arm of Blackrock, the investment house—is keen not to waste time. As he made clear during his victory speech, “the world isn’t waiting for us.” Germany, he added, could not spend months haggling over the finer points of a coalition agreement while Ukraine’s fate is decided by Trump and the man whom they feel has captured him, Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Kaja Kallas, the E.U.’s chief diplomat, reiterated that point, expressing the hope that a new government is formed “as quickly as possible, as we really need to move on with decisions at the European level which requires German participation.” With Emmanuel Macron in Washington today, and Keir Starmer following on Thursday, Europe is seeking to persuade Trump to step back from his seeming endorsement of Putin’s Ukraine position. Both the French and British leaders have been coordinating their positions, stressing the need for quiet diplomacy. But within hours of securing his election victory, Merz appeared to take a more confrontational approach toward the White House. “My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” Merz said Sunday, before even the final election tally came in. Some wondered whether this might be another example of an impetuousness that is seen, even by his confidants, as a weak spot in Merz’s character. Yet he doubled down on his position the following morning: “Now more than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength. For a just peace, the attacked country must be part of peace negotiations.” For such talk to have substance, Merz will have to show that he is prepared to borrow more to ramp up Germany’s defense budget. A decade after NATO members agreed to devote a minimum of 2% of GDP for military spending, Germany only reached that target in 2024. In order to increase it to 2.5%, let alone a new 3% target, will cost tens of billions. For that, the incoming government will have to reform its so-called “debt brake” that places stringent limits on public debt. It seems that Merz is prepared to do that, with the support of the center-left Social Democrats. The outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s SPD suffered a humiliating result, falling into third place to a historic low. They are now expected to play a junior role in a center-right administration. Yet some of Merz’s agenda will be hard for it to accede to, particularly elements of his economic reform package such as welfare cuts and tax breaks, and his plans to crack down hard on illegal migration. In one respect, the row with Trump makes Merz’s task harder; it is a warning to mainstream on the politicians on both the left and right of what may follow if they fail to form a durable coalition. Encouraged by its best-ever result, with 20% of the vote, and boosted by the boisterous support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump Administration, the AfD is waiting in the wings. It is preparing a second front of attack the moment the new government faces its next crisis. The far-right in Germany is confident that its moment will come, again. Contact us at letters@time.com

Title: German election: Who won, who lost and what’s next?

Christian Democrats came first. Their leader, Friedrich Merz, is expected to be next chancellor. But the far right and the left were the top gainers. The conservative Christian Democrats have won Germany’s national election, putting them on track to lead the next coalition government, according to provisional results. The outcome means the party’s leader, Friedrich Merz, will likely be Germany’s next chancellor. Here’s a breakdown of Sunday’s election results and what to expect from Germany’s next leadership: Conservative and right-wing parties emerged on top. The mainstream conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), along with its partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), finished first with 28.6 percent of the vote, while the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged into second with 20.8 percent, according to provisional results announced by election authorities. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) came in third with just 16.4 percent, a nearly 10-point drop from their first-place finish in 2021. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz of SPD acknowledged a “bitter” defeat, saying “the election result is poor and I bear responsibility”. Germany’s Greens and the far-left Die Linke, or The Left, party exceeded the 5 percent threshold to secure seats in parliament, with 11.6 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively. As a result, the CDU/CSU partnership is projected to secure 208 seats in the Bundestag, the German parliament, the AfD 152, the SPD 120, the Greens 85 and The Left 64. The 69-year-old CDU leader is a multimillionaire lawyer who has been in and out of politics for decades. He was first elected to the European Parliament in 1989, and by 2000 had become chairman of the CDU’s parliamentary alliance. However, fellow party member Angela Merkel eventually pushed Merz aside, and he left parliament in 2009 to jump into the private sector, working for multinational companies like Mayer Brown and BlackRock Germany. Merz was re-elected leader of the CDU in 2022 after Merkel retired from politics following her 16-year-long stint as the country’s chancellor. A social conservative who has broached the idea of a new European defence coalition, Merz says he plans to govern Germany “reliably” and push for European “independence” from the United States. “That is my absolute priority, I have no illusions at all about what will come out of America,” Merz said on Sunday, amid growing public differences between European leaders and US President Donald Trump over Ukraine and US security cover for Europe. Soon after his party’s victory on Monday, Merz went on to pledge that Europe will “remain firmly by” Ukraine, which he said must play a role in any peace negotiations. The far-right party finished just after Merz’s CDU, with 20.8 percent of the vote, double their 2021 support. It is projected to win 152 seats in parliament. That marks the strongest showing by a far-right movement in Germany since the end of World War II. The AfD’s rise highlights its growing populist appeal among voters who are critical of immigration and the European Union, especially in eastern Germany, where it outperformed all other parties. Despite little chance of the AfD being invited into a coalition, the party, led by 46-year-old Alice Weidel, is celebrating what it believes to be a victory, positioning a once-fringe force firmly in the mainstream of Europe’s right wing. The results are also expected to further strengthen the AfD’s clout in the German parliament, where it scored a big win in January when Merz and the CDU — for all of their talk of not allying with the far-right party — turned to Weidel’s group for votes to push through a bill calling for tougher restrictions on immigration. The Left won 8.8 percent of the vote, nearly doubling its share from the last election. It performed especially well in the capital, Berlin, surpassing all parties with 19.9 percent of the vote. That puts it on track to win 64 seats in the Bundestag. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), a populist left-wing party formed last year after a split with The Left, took 4.97 percent of the vote. That was just shy of the 5 percent hurdle needed to take seats in the Bundestag, meaning larger parties would get more seats. The Social Democrats’ two outgoing coalition partners – the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) – also took a hit in the elections. The Greens won 11.6 percent of the vote, a 3 percent drop from the 2021 elections. The party’s chancellor candidate, Robert Habeck, conceded it was “not a good result” and said he would no longer seek a leading role in the party. The FDP, which effectively triggered the snap election by abandoning the coalition over a budget dispute, fared worse, getting just 4.3 percent of the vote. Since the party did not win any constituencies, and its national vote is below the 5 percent threshold required to hold seats in parliament allocated through proportional representation, it is projected to lose all 91 seats it has held since 2021. As its poor result became clear, leader Christian Lindner announced he would leave active politics. “The German election brought defeat for the FDP, but hopefully a new start for Germany. This is what I fought for,” he said in a post on X. Die Bundestagswahl brachte eine Niederlage für die FDP, aber hoffentlich einen Neuanfang für Deutschland. Dafür hatte ich gekämpft. Nun scheide ich aus der aktiven Politik aus. Mit nur einem Gefühl: Dankbarkeit für fast 25 intensive, herausfordernde Jahre voller Gestaltung und… pic.twitter.com/UuT1jTUeRW — Christian Lindner (@c_lindner) February 23, 2025 Merz will now begin the tough task of forming a coalition government. To do so, he needs to shore up at least 316 seats in the 630-member Bundestag. He has ruled out working with the far-right AfD, saying they have “fundamentally different views”, despite joining hands with the party in January over the immigration bill. That means his best bet is likely a two-way alliance with the SPD, which would come out to 328 seats. The CDU/CSU and the SPD have ruled through so-called grand coalitions four times in the past — between 1966 and 1969 in West Germany, and thrice since reunification, under Merkel’s chancellorship. A three-way partnership with the Greens and The Left would likely require more concessions from Merz’s centrist CDU and be more fragile. The Greens support higher taxes on the wealthy and renewable energy, while Merz favours corporate tax cuts and nuclear energy. The Left also backs higher taxes for the rich and advocates laxer immigration policies, conflicting with Merz’s stance to curb immigration and ramp up deportations. The composition of the next government is also likely to influence the foreign policy stances that Merz, who aims for Germany to play a leading role in European affairs and help unite the continent, can adopt. “If it winds up being a coalition with two parties – with Merz and CDU, and the centre left – that puts him [Merz] in a stronger position,” global strategy adviser Marco Vicenzino told Al Jazeera. “If it has to go into a three-party coalition, it gets into a weaker position.” With major defence challenges facing Europe, particularly due to the war in Ukraine, the European Union’s foreign policy chief urged German parties to form a coalition quickly “I hope that they do it as fast as possible, because we really need to move on with the decisions also on the European level that require German participation,” said Kaja Kallas. Merz said he hoped to form a new government by Easter, April 20, 2025. Party leaders have hailed AfD’s performance and argued it should be represented in the next coalition government. “We have achieved something historic today,” AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla said to cheering supporters on Sunday. “We are now the political centre and we have left the fringes behind us.” Weidel said the party remains open to joining a coalition and claimed that if Merz partners with left-wing parties instead, that would be “electoral fraud”. If that happens, she added, “next time we’ll come first”. Follow Al Jazeera English:

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin and ether, the two largest digital assets by market value, remain largely within their recent trading ranges two days after the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges. Perpetual funding rates for both are positive, indicating a bias for long positions that benefit from price rises. Bitcoin options trading on Deribit show a bullish bias for call options across all time frames, while those tied to ether show a downside bias into March. The bias for ether puts, however, has been present since well before the hack. Meanwhile, Volmex Finance's 30-day bitcoin implied volatility index has dropped to an annualized 48.45%, the lowest since July, according to charting platform TradingView. Ether's implied volatility has reversed the minor weekend spike from 67% to 70%. The calm is a sign of market maturity, according to QCP Capital. "The price action underscores the growing maturity of the crypto landscape since the FTX collapse in 2022, particularly in the crypto credit market," the trading firm said. "Every facet of crypto — from custodial and security solutions to corporate governance and transparency — has strengthened with each past crisis." Overall, the crypto community is reassured by Bybit’s ability to manage over $6 billion in withdrawals following the hack. Plus, the exchange has filled the gap in its ETH reserves. According to Mena Theodorou, a co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, all eyes will be on Solana's SOL as Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has submitted a spot SOL ETF proposal to the SEC. In addition, 11.2 million SOL (2.3% of total supply) from the FTX estate are scheduled to be unlocked on March 1, which could breed market volatility. That has already boosted volume in SOL put options on Deribit. President Donald Trump's decision to audit gold reserves at Fort Knox in Kentucky has piqued interest in the crypto community. "While routine gold audits are rare, the timing is notable as Trump continues to push a pro-crypto narrative. If the gold supply turns out to be lower than expected, it could reinforce Bitcoin’s case as digital gold — and possibly even as a superior reserve asset," Theodorou said in an email. In traditional markets, the yen continues to gain ground against the U.S. dollar and growth-sensitive commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar, calling for caution on the part of the risk asset bulls.

Title: Review: Space to Grow

Full Content:
Space to Grow: Unlocking the Final Economic Frontier by Matthew Weinzierl and Brendan Rosseau Harvard Business Review Press, 2025 hardcover, 320 pp., illus. ISBN 978-1-64782-716-8 US$32 At Blue Origin, the company with the motto “Gradatim ferociter” or “step by step ferociously,” the steps have been a little more ferocious so far this year. The company finally conducted its first New Glenn orbital launch in January, a mission that was mostly successful other than a failed booster landing. Earlier this month, the company launched its New Shepard suborbital vehicle, demonstrating the ability to provide simulated lunar gravity for the payloads inside for about two minutes. This week, the company will launch another New Shepard carrying six private astronauts. But, earlier this month, the company also announced it was laying off about 10% of its workforce, at least 1,000 employees. Dave Limp, the CEO of Blue Origin, said the company had created “more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed” as it grew significantly in recent years. The layoffs were intended to address those concerns, reducing both engineering and management positions. Limp, a longtime Amazon executive, was hired a little more than a year ago by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos to make the company more decisive. ““He said he didn’t think Blue needed another rocket scientist,” Limp said of Bezos at the Commercial Space Conference in Washington a day before he announced the layoffs. “What we needed was a little bit more organization, a little more decisiveness, some manufacturing expertise.” Those events demonstrated that technical success is a necessary but not sufficient condition for success in commercial space: companies, even those backed by billionaires, must eventually demonstrate that they can provide a product that meets the needs of customers and in a way that is financially sustainable. That is at the core of Space to Grow, a new book by Matthew Weinzierl, a professor at Harvard Business School (HBS), and Brendan Rosseau, a former teaching fellow and research associate there. The authors, who created a space economics project at HBS, make clear they see tremendous opportunity for the commercial space industry thanks to the reduced costs to build and launch spacecraft and the growing value of services provided by those satellites in communications, Earth observation, and other sectors. But while they call this a “revolution,” this is book is not an uncritical, overzealous look at the space industry, but one grounded in the rigors of economics. Many of the chapters in the book are case studies of some major space companies: Blue Origin, Planet, SpaceX, and others. Those chapters trace the rise (and sometimes fall: one of the profiled companies is defunct asteroid mining startup Planetary Resources) of these companies, including how they responded to, and sometimes reshaped, the markets. That is tied to what can be considered the book’s central theme, that under certain conditions, markets are efficient. They use economic concepts throughout the book to support their analyses of the companies they profile. Those concepts range from simple supply-and-demand curves to more advanced concepts like the Le Chatelier principle, which explains how decreasing the cost of the supply of a product or service may create only modest increases in demand in the short term, but larger changes in the long term as the market takes more advantage of that less expensive supply. Fortunately, you do not need a background in economics to appreciate that: Weinzierl and Rosseau do a good job explaining those concepts in plain language. They acknowledge that, despite that central theme, markets are not always efficient. They discuss market failures like orbital debris, where there are limited incentives for satellite operators to pay to clean up their defunct satellites, along with regulatory obstacles. They also cite concerns of monopoly power that SpaceX in particular holds in the launch sector; competition, they note, is one of those “certain conditions” required for markets to be efficient. Much of the background about the companies in the book will be familiar to readers, but the economic framing is useful for people inside and outside the industry alike. The authors stop short of making specific recommendations for companies or policymakers, but it’s clear they see potential for efficient markets to enable further growth of the industry. In light of the recent events at Blue Origin, it was worth examining that chapter in detail to review their assessment of the company. A “monumental turning point” for the company, in the words of former president Rob Meyerson, was the decision not to bid on the next phase of NASA’s commercial crew program in 2012 after participating in earlier phases. By doing so, Weinzierl and Rosseau state, Blue Origin was “denying itself the discipline imposed by the market forces that are at the heart of the commercial space revolution’s promise” and acting more like a “philanthropic nonprofit than like a space startup.” That appears to be changing now, both with Blue Origin’s technical accomplishments and its internal shakeups. “We have made a lot of progress in the past year on fundamentals and acting quickly and turning us into a world-class manufacturing company, and focusing the company,” Limp said at the Commercial Space Conference. “I think we’ve made some progress. We have a lot to do this year, too.” Note: the authors provided me with a galley of Space to Grow and requested a blurb about the book, which was included in the published version. That blurb reflected my sincere opinion of the book, described in far greater detail in this review.

Title: After Germany’s Right-Wing Gains in Elections, New Conservative Leader Vows to ‘Achieve Independence’ From U.S. Under Trump’s Rule

By Ed Meza @edmezavar While the far right made historic gains in Germany’s pivotal federal elections on Sunday, the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party ultimately thrived with Friedrich Merz securing nearly 29% of the vote and placing him in the top spot to lead the country. Poised to become Germany’s next chancellor, Merz has yet to form a coalition with at least one other party in order to secure a majority in the German parliament, but he has already vowed to “achieve independence from the U.S.A.” in view of President Donald Trump’s indifference towards Europe. These elections, which saw a record-breaking voter turnout of 83.5% (the highest since unification in 1990), saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party make historic gains to become the second largest political force in the country. Related Stories VIP+ Apple TV+ Viewership Is Surging. Is It the ‘Severance’ Halo Effect? 'A Complete Unknown' and Timothée Chalamet's Late Oscars Surge Could Result in a Best Picture Spoiler With around 21% of the vote, the AfD nearly doubled its result from four years ago as immigration, crime, inflation, unemployment and the war in Ukraine became hot-button issues that helped galvanized support for the populist, Eurosceptic party, which leads in eastern Germany. The rise of the far right in the country has also been fueled by a series of attacks that have involved immigrants, the latest of which happened on Feb. 13 in Munich, on the eve of the Berlin Film Festival, and caused dozens of injuries. Popular on Variety Sunday’s snap election was triggered by the collapse in November of Germany’s coalition government made up of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s left-of-center Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens and the business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP). Disputes over budget and economic policy led Scholz to fire FDP finance minister Christian Lindner, ending the coalition. For the moment, there appears no chance of the AfD joining a new government with the CDU as Merz has rejected forming a coalition with the party, which remains a pariah in Germany’s political establishment. The AfD has nevertheless won strong support from the Trump administration – Musk in particular has championed it as the only party “that can save Germany.” For Merz, that support appears to have gone too far. Taking part in a discussion on broadcaster ARD on Sunday, Merz said it was his “absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that we can really achieve independence from the U.S.A. as quickly as possible.” Merz, a traditionally pro-American politician and former exec at Blackrock, said he would have never imagined saying something like that on television but stressed that Trump’s recent statements made it clear that his administration was “largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.” He also questioned the future of NATO and said it may be necessary to establish an independent European defense capability, noting that he had “no illusions at all about what is happening in America — just look at the recent interference in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk. “The interference from Washington was no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interference we saw from Moscow,” he added. “We are under so much pressure here from two sides that my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.” German security officials have accused Russian actors of spreading disinformation online with fabricated videos claiming election fraud in the country in the run-up to Sunday’s vote. For Merz, navigating such a new kind of relationship with the U.S. may be challenging despite his own extensive ties to the business world. A corporate lawyer, Merz served as a member of parliament, or the Bundestag, from 1994 to 2009, when he left politics for a private sector career that saw him take seats on numerous corporate boards, including that of supervisory board chairman of Blackrock Germany from 2016 to 2020. What effect those ties may have on his administration remains to be seen. Merz’s election was actually welcomed by Trump who hailed it as “a great day” for Germany in a post on his social network Social Truth on Sunday. “It looks like the conservative party in Germany has won the elections… This is a great day for Germany and the United States of America, under the leadership of a ‘gentleman’… Congratulations to everyone,” Trump wrote. Trump is not the only problem Germany is facing. The country is currently undergoing a period of economic decline as it struggles with such major challenges as inflation, immigration and the consequences of the war in Ukraine, including the end of cheap Russian gas that for decades powered Germany’s industrial might. While votes are still being tallied late into the night Sunday, a coalition between the CDU and the SPD, which managed 16% of the vote, or a larger one with the SPD and Green Party (12%) is seen as likely. However, political analysts see a three-way coalition as potentially dysfunctional due to the major policy differences between the CDU and Greens. Taking part in a roundtable discussion on Sunday on broadcaster ARD, AfD head and chancellor candidate Alice Weidel said the CDU had “completely copied our program, adopted our entire position” but would “not be able to implement it with leftist parties.” Weidel said the AfD was extending its hand to the CDU, noting that Merz may not be willing to accept it but perhaps others in the CDU would. Weidel warned that a coalition between the CDU, SPD and Greens would result in an “unstable government that would not last four years” and the AfD would end up overtaking the CDU in the next few years. While widely rejected by the establishment, the AfD and its policies, including its stark anti-immigration stance and demonization of pro-Palestinian activists, seem to have had a profound impact on Germany’s other leading parties. The AfD’s stance on cultural issues was also evident in the recent revamp of federal film funding. The AfD has long rejected diversity, gender equality, inclusion, anti-discrimination and sustainability as film funding criteria – standards that were championed by Green Party culture minister Claudia Roth in her ambitious reform of film funding legislation. Yet, it was the FDP that killed the draft law’s planned diversity advisory board and ecological sustainability guidelines when it agreed to provide its decisive vote for the measure in December, saying it was seeking to do away with “bureaucratic advisory councils.” The reform nevertheless managed to extend and increase two key funding incentives, implementing one of three planned measures that also included a 30% tax incentive and an investment obligation for streamers and broadcasters. Some industry players are eager to see the new government tackle those measures, others less so. In a statement to Variety, Fred Kogel, CEO of leading entertainment giant Leonine Studios, said: “We’re confident that the new government under the leadership of Friedrich Merz will be formed quickly and will help our country move forward. Over the course of the last months, we held constructive talks with members of the CDU/CSU, SPD and Bündnis 90/Die Grünen [the Greens] who recognize the cultural and economic importance of Germany as a media hub. “We now need to build on this,” Kogel added. “The rapid introduction of a tax incentive and an investment obligation with a legally regulated reversion of rights to producers remains our key message to the new government. This is a long overdue step and the only way to restore Germany’s international competitiveness as a media location and as a relevant player in the global production business.” Björn Böhning, CEO of the Produktionsallianz industry association, added: “Germany urgently needs a stable and capable federal government. The film and television production industry also depends on planning security and sustainable framework conditions. The international competitiveness of Germany as a film location stands and falls with the continuation of the film reform that has begun. It is high time to finally hold international streaming providers accountable and ensure that rights to German productions do not migrate abroad unhindered.” The Produktionsallianz therefore calls on the new federal government to approve the investment commitment as well as the planned tax incentive within the 100-day program of its term in office, Böhning said. Vaunet, the association of private broadcasters, is vehemently opposed to an investment obligation for VoD providers, which, it argues, restricts programming freedom and would not necessarily lead to an increase in investments in Germany. It does back the new tax incentive plan, however. Vaunet expressed hope that a new government would improve economic prospects and create a fairer environment. “The audio and audiovisual sector is both an economic and a cultural asset: Securing the economic foundations and freedom of programming as well as protecting content is crucial for the activities of journalistic and editorial media and thus for our democracy. “Vaunet therefore expects a new government to bring about a rapid and sustainable improvement in the economic framework, especially in the areas of refinancing through advertising, as well as preventing further burdens on media providers and equalizing the level playing field with the big tech platforms. Strong and competitive private media are the guarantee of media diversity in Germany and an important driver of the cultural and creative industries.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Germany Holds an Election in an Alternate Reality

Germany held an election yesterday. It went about as expected. The biggest surprise continues to be how the majority of parties all support some flavor of ongoing belligerence towards Russia — a policy that is destroying Germany. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) achieved its best result in any national vote (20.8 percent) since it was founded in 2013. The party which started out more as an anti-EU, anti-NATO party and became more ethno nationalist and now favors both an end to conflict with Russia as well as strong ties with the US, looks likely to be excluded from government according to statements from Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leaders. The pro-war, capital-friendly CDU came in first with 28.6 percent and will likely head the next government with former Blackrock executive Friedrich Merz at the helm. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s centrist Social Democratic Party (SPD) was rewarded for its disastrous governance of the past four years with its worst national election result (16.4 percent) in more than a century. Yet its stance on “supporting” Ukraine remains unchanged. And the warmongering Greens lost a few points from 2021 but remained mostly steady with 11.6 percent of the vote. As of Monday morning in Berlin the anti-war Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) is at 4.97 percent, which means the party would just miss getting into the Bundestag. Some BSW members are crying foul: The Germans abroad referenced by De Masi cannot vote at embassies or consulates and postal delays might have prevented their ballots from arriving on time. Euronews, for example, reports on abroad voters still waiting for their ballots on Thursday, which even if returned immediately via express mail would have been unlikely to arrive before the 6 pm Sunday deadline. Here are some possibilities on the future governing coalition from Deutsche Welle: To form a government, a majority of at least 316 seats out of the 630 seats in the Bundestag is needed. A coalition between CDU and AfD would have been possible numerically, as both parties easily pass this threshhold, adding up to 358. But according to conservative leader Friedrich Merz, this is out of the question. That leaves Olaf Scholz’s SPD as a possible partner, which together with CDU scrape by with 328 seats. A bigger majority could be formed if CDU were to add the Greens to the mix, reaching 416. But the CDU’s junior partner CSU has repeatedly ruled out governing with the Greens. Over the coming days and weeks a coalition will likely be formed, voter shifts will be dissected, and campaign promises will fade away. There will be plenty of time to examine that, but here I’d like to pose a few questions. Will the new chancellor and the new government be able to confront reality and begin to seek a path out of Germany current …predicament? How could they do so? And are any of the parties that will be seated in the upcoming Bundestag even asking the right questions that would lead to possible answers? Germany’s House of Mirrors Germany’s political elite largely represented by the four parties (the CDU/CSU, SPD, Greens, and the Free Democratic Party, which fell below the five percent threshold to be seated in the Bundestag) remain stuck in the “rules-based order” transatlantic fantasyland championing their democracy and liberal values while demonizing Russia, reality is at the gates. It’s increasingly difficult to square that paradigm while remaining obsessed with supporting Israel’s genocide campaign and criminalizing speech (notice JD Vance in his widely celebrated Munich dress down didn’t criticize Germany’s heavy handed approach when it comes to this area of free speech). But more than anything it is an economy circling the drain, which is largely the result of the war against Russia, as well as hitching itself to the US empire with a more combative stance against Beijing. And for all the talk of a US-Russia peace, what do we have so far? Let’s cut away all the headline-grabbing transatlantic political fights and look at the ways Germany and Europe remain on autopilot on a journey to becoming the next Ukraine: The madwoman in Berlin, foreign minister Annalena Baerbock let the cat out of the bag on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that $700 billion is coming. She told Berliner Zeitung the following: “We will launch a large package that has never been seen on this scale before,” said Baerbock. “Similar to the euro or the [Coronavirus] crisis, there is now a financial package for security in Europe. That will come in the near future.” According to Baerbock, the deal will be announced sometime after the German election. The package is believed to include money for ​​”military training, the acceleration of relief efforts, arms deliveries and what Europe could offer for security guarantees.” Merz, too, is reportedly on board. He had this to say following yesterday’s victory. From DW: The favorite for the future German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, sharply criticized Donald Trump’s administration and urged Europe to distance [itself] from Washington during a post-election panel airing on state broadcaster ARD. “I am communicating closely with a lot of prime ministers, and heads of EU states and for me it is an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieve independence from the US, step by step,” Merz said. “Step by step” is doing a lot of work there. Merz was after all recently floating the idea of buying F-35s from the US. How will the European public, which has largely soured on the war, react to more power going to Brussels and loads of debt in order to keep losing to the Russians? The humiliation from the US has been so thorough — self-inflicted by Europe but humiliating nonetheless — while the propaganda against Russia so relentless for years, I wonder if we’re going to see a rally around the EU flag moment similar to the time after the official start of the Ukraine war in 2022. The hatred and fear of Russia certainly remains strong: One factor limiting the stimulus to be had from rearmament is that Europe buys much of its military gear from American suppliers. Former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s competitiveness report estimated that 78% of purchases come from production outside the EU—and 63% from the US alone. That means any “multiplier” effect of stepped-up spending on growth would be low. What’s more, recruiting more Europeans to the military and defense industry would bring down unemployment, possibly fueling inflationary pressures that would lead to higher interest rates. In all, Rush calculates that EU economic output might be higher by about 0.6% in 2028, “which implies a modest nudge up in GDP growth in the next few years.” And yet the priority is more weapons to fund an unwinnable war and prevent the Russians from conquering Europe — a threat for which there is still no evidence and makes no sense if you spend ten seconds thinking about it. But on the plus side from the perspective of the European vultures, it provides cover to continue dismantling the welfare state and privatize everything from infrastructure to social services. The US and Russia could work out some rapprochement, which some in Washington believe will help with other wars in the Middle East, as well as the looming confrontation with China. Meanwhile, the EU continues to piss into the tent, and should talks between Washington and Moscow fall apart, Europe’s militarization is setting it up to become the next Ukraine. That would certainly “extend” Russia as the famous 2019 RAND report suggested. At the very least, Europe’s doubling down on suicidal belligerence ensures that it remains walled off from the Eurasian project for the foreseeable future, and the US can focus its efforts on blowing up other bridges in the world’s heartland. One would have thought that the US would have had to stay in the heavyweight fight against Russia in order to continue to profit off of Europe’s misery, but this line of thinking might have underestimated the EU’s impotence. As of now, it looks like the EU countries are content with ongoing vassalage despite the increasing abuse coming from Washington. What Is Needed to Get Germany — and Europe — out of This Mess? The New York Times ran a Friday guest essay by one Konstantin Richter entitled “Germany Is in Big Trouble, and Nobody Knows What to Do About It.” What? There are plenty of people who have been saying for the past three years (at least) that Germany was heading down a ruinous path. To change course all it would take would be a minimal amount of courage to imagine Germany as part of Eurasia, break with transatlantic slavishness — including quitting NATO, repair ties itself with Russia, take up China on its offer to merge the Belt and Road Initiative with Europe’s Global Gateway, and forge stronger ties in other areas. Rather than spend untold billions on arming against some imaginary Russian invasion, the EU could use that money to rebuild its economies with the help of Russian energy, Chinese investment, and integration with Eurasia. Yet, there are no signs this is being considered — at least not yet. Why, for example, are European heads of state not requesting their own bilateral talks with Russia? There is nothing preventing them from doing so. Why not resurrect the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe? At some point — one way or another — Europe is going to have to come to terms with Russia’s desire for a new European security architecture agreement. Do any of Germany’s leaders look capable of such a task? Are they even thinking about it? Are any in Europe for that matter? Maybe Orban? What’s on Offer Instead? Well, let’s take a brief look at the positions of the parties in yesterday’s election. Merz and the CDU. They represent the status quo with regards to Russia and atlanticism with more financialization to boot. Merz is the author of 2008 book “Dare more capitalism” and dare he does. The former Blackrock executive loves himself some privatization and deregulation. German workers are likely to see their living standards continue to decline under a Merz government. Merz likes to talk about Germany taking on a leadership role in Europe. What does that entail? Here’s a taste: International fugitive and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had a “warm conversation” with new German chancellor Friedrich Merz. Despite an ICC arrest warrant, Merz said he would invite Netanyahu to Germany, according to Netanyahu’s office. — jeremy scahill (@jeremyscahill) February 24, 2025 Here’s what the European Council on Foreign Relations expects: Should Merz triumph, the new German government will have a mandate to pursue a foreign policy based on integration steps concerning defence spending and debt-sponsored innovation policies. Eventually, Germany will be less likely to aim for the broad supranational alliances it previously developed to ensure no state was left behind. Instead, a ‘two-speed Europe’ is likely—although it come at the cost of alienating Germany’s core EU partner, France. …apart from Merz, the CDU’s leaders are generally younger—the powerful leader of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hendrik Wüst, is 49; the informal leader of the CDU’s conservative wing, Jens Spahn, is 44. Politically socialised in a reunified Germany, this new generation refers to their country as a clear leader in both Europe and the EU. Their parents were born after the second world war, while their grandparents—who might retain some connection to the post-war order—have long since passed away. Consequently, they lack the ties which defined previous generations of German leaders. To them, restraint is a foreign policy concept not rooted in personal conviction. AfD – Who knows? What Wolfgang Streeck said last year in an interview with Die Zeit about the AfD rings increasingly true: ​​I don’t know a single consistent thought from [Bjorn] Höcke and his followers. It’s all just cynical symbolic provocations. Lately that lack of consistency means taking a more friendly turn towards the US. The party that started out as an anti-EU and morphed more into an anti-immigrant has long been hated and feared by the German political-media establishment. Yes, it has a small core support from neo Nazis, but the real reason was its anti-NATO stance, brutal honesty about Berlin being a “slave” to the US, and a desire to make nice with Moscow seeing as it is in the national interest of Germany to do so. Well, last month the AfD adopted a motion in support of Germany and the US building closer relations, and it has embraced of Elon Musk and the Trump administration. So one can expect it to be an extension of the US rebrand in Europe. The shift also shows up in polling. German public opinion begins to take a more realistic view of the country’s relationship with the US: But the AfD supporters, unlike other German voters, are softening their stance towards Washington: Streeck, in that interview with Die Zeit, continued: Conservatives on the right believe in a natural hierarchy, a world in which the better ones are there to tell the less good ones what to do. But I am an unconverted egalitarian: all people are of equal value. Furthermore, right-wing conservatives believe that there can be no peace in this world: there are Schmittian existential enemies with whom we can only live if we don’t let them live. The latter has become a central theme of the American neocons and the European NATO conservatives, including our foreign minister. Zeit: Are you comparing Annalena Baerbock to Höcke? Streeck: If you say that this war can only end when we hand Putin over to The Hague, then that means final victory: German tanks in Moscow. And I say we should think about that again. And that leads us to… The Greens At least we know what we’re going to get here: more crazy, exemplified by Baerbock. Annalena Baerbock is apparently still angry about Russia’s WW2 defeat of Nazi Germany. Baerbock fixates on the Oder River, where her Nazi grandfather fought against Russia. Imagine the anti-Russia hatred in the Baerbock households during Annalena’s formative years. https://t.co/esk9rOsgZ0 pic.twitter.com/ujWx2IV3JX — ⏳Towhee 🌏☮️ (@amborin) February 21, 2025 The Greens are already angling to get into the next government with the party’s Bundestag leader, Britta Haßelmann, telling DW that the Greens are now more of a governing party than an opposition party. Wonderful. SPD. Representative of the “center.” Largely on board with Germany’s neoliberal war path, but might get there slower than the Greens and CDU. Die Linke. The Left Party collapsed in recent years after abandoning nearly all of its former working class platform in favor of identity politics in an attempt to appear “ready to govern.” The party saw a resurgence in response to the AfD’s rise, as well as a renewed focus on economic issues. It also softened key foreign policy stances including dropping any pretense of opposition to NATO, and there’s no evidence that the party is prepared to consider what is necessary to get Germany out of the hole it has dug for itself. BSW. Sahra Wagenknecht from the party that bears her name might be the one politician who grasps the enormity of Germany’s challenge and what it takes to tackle them. She’s been pushing the balancing of ties between the US and Eurasia and rebuilding German industry while also curtailing immigration. Alas, as of Monday morning in Germany BSW is only at 4.9 percent — just short of the 5 needed to get the party’s anti-war voice in the Bundestag. If Merz and company are serious about moving forward with hundreds of billions for militarization, it’s hard to see how the situation in Germany doesn’t go from a disaster to devastation. Even without that colossal misstep, it still appears as though the situation is destined to get a lot worse before it can get better. It all brings to mind something Glenn Diesen wrote the other day: … idealism is dangerous as unrealistic demands and uncompromising moral slogans are destroying both Ukraine and Europe. A key rule in political realism is that refusing to accept the world as it is will result in devastation. Once Trump’s team settled on a plan regarding Ukraine-Russia-Europe events and policy changes have been moving so fast these recent weeks, I’m half expecting Trump to announce an alliance with Russia against Ukraine and Europe. I jest, but never expected such quick US reproachment towards Russia. But Trump’s swift reproachment with Russia comes with a warning: Why is he doing it? So that the US can next try to drive a wedge between Russia and China. He motives I suspect are not entirely pure or innocent as he presents. Trump campaigned in 2016 in favor of better relations with Russia but was convinced/coerced into continuing anti-Russian policies. Russiagate was powerful in this regard. So perhaps his turn toward Russia is another part of him doing everything that the permanent bureaucracy and the media stopped him from doing last time. For better or worse. Good observation on driving a wedge. But Brian Berletic, always a voice of sanity, believes this is anything but a rapprochement with Russia. He believes the US intends to continue the war but is trying to rework the division of labour. As always he is meticulous about backing himself up with sources direct from the parties themselves. Check out his post of two days ago with Angelo Giuliano, titled “Is There a Real US-EU Split?” Warning: it’s a long one – 2 hours. I trust Brian on military issues; on geopolitics, not so much. Experts such as Jeffrey Sachs differ with him, in major ways. This is ad hominem. You need to address the particulars of his argument and try to debunk that and not engage in a personal attack in lieu of a rebuttal. I’ve watched Brian’s podcast and his interviews here in BKK. He tends to become adamant about US “actions”. His military background is extensive enough but his grasp of geopolitics often seems naïve, rather idealistic. He often “protests too much”. Sounds good to me. EU leaders have flocked to Kiev today to announce their undying support. The Germans now seem determined to give Ukraine taurus missiles to fire directly into Russia. Starmer now ‘guarantees’ that Ukraine will join Nato. World War III to come? Only if Trump agrees to send US troops into the Ukraine which he does not want to do, no matter how many times countries like the UK and France try to trick him into it. If countries like the UK, France and Germany sent troops into the Ukraine, the Russians have already said that they would attack them which is why they won’t do it without total US backing. Numbers would be low in any case. I believe that with troop rotations in mind, that the UK has said that it can only send in a hodgepodge force of some 3,000 troops as part of such an effort so that is about a brigade’s worth. You couldn’t garrison a major city with a force that size. They would probably be outnumbered by the local police force. Thank you, John. The UK’s stuffed. Let’s get it over with. Northwood and High Wycombe are down the road. Perhaps a warning shot on Chequers first? Thank you. Good idea. I had some friends visiting over the weekend and showed them Chequers and Wotton. I’m sure the Russians have the GPS coordinates 51.74357064219684, -0.781010480432043 Do they seem determined to do so? (sending Taurus to Ukraine and launching them towards Russia). I though it was nothing but cheap talk by Merz moths ago. Not having warranted support from the US which in turn has stopped launching ATACMS i believe this will not happen. It would be extremely stupid given Europe is absolutely unprepared against Russian retaliatory attacks with whatever they have including the Oreshniks. It´s just filling empty space. I have seldom seen such a blowhard as Merz. Even worse than Scholz or even Habeck who has actually turned out to be a giantly dishonest asshole considering his insulting behaviour towards his own ministerial staff. I have got accustomed to a little trick – if you wanna know a politician´s true colours go back to their early years and look what they did and how. And you will mostly see a ridiculous, cowardly clown. At least Lindner is honest. He promised not to enter another coalition with the Greens and will do what he said How will the European public, which has largely soured on the war, react to more power going to Brussels and loads of debt in order to keep losing to the Russians? They are going to punish the establishment by voting for it again. And has the public really soured on the war? They seem to not like the economic repercussions of the war, but the war course itself remains popular. There is no innocent population that was forced to go down this path by a treasonous political elite. Most people actively want this, they are just bitching and moaning about the personal discomfort that follows from their own actions. What is clear from the German election result is that the country is still divided into east and west Germany. After the asset stripping of eastern Germany to profit the west, the far right moved into the area and started to blame foreigners for all their woes, rather than the real culprits which was the German state and German corporations. This suited the west because it diverted attention from the real cause so they colluded to support the lie of foreign workers and not corporate asset stripping. Thus east Germany became the new home for the fascists of west Germany, the type of politics that the east had banned because of its destructive divisive nature. Now Germany is divided between the far right and the not quite so far right, not because thy are supported but because the left has been so heavily infiltrated by the right (the Greens are now a pro war party). It is said that the turnout has been high at over 80% but the result is still fractured and the German election rules have left many parties marginalized and unable to campaign effectively (criticism of Israel can result in bans). What is clear is that this election leaves the country deeply split and the people strongly opposed to the state The final tally for BSW — the only voice in the center-to-left spectrum that opposes further German military support for Ukraine — is 4.972%, missing by only 14,000 of more than 49.6 million votes cast (82.5% turnout) to hit the 5% required to enter the Bundestag (good graphics and numbers freely available here). This is a tragedy. Had they made the mark, the probable center-right aggressively Russophobic minority government would be more difficult to achieve. The blind march to war is so disheartening. It feels like 1914 around here. A CDU/CSU coalition with SPD is natural given their convergence on the top policy agenda items. (The Greens fit quite well too.) Given the progress of AfD, would it make sense for the CDU/CSU to form an pact with the SPD for future elections? Where are my manners? Thank you, Conor, for this valuable summary. My comment was already in mod when it dawned on me. Thank you, Conor. Further to the dodgy grandfathers, how about AfD toff Beatrix von Storch’s. “Why not resurrect the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe?” Aha, Conor Gallagher, because the OSCE had found extensive violation of human rights in Ukraine — including torture chambers and disappearances. The OSCE had to tone down those unfortunate findings after it became necessary to prove that the Russians were just plain old crazy Asiatics. Meanwhile, going forward, the horizontal bar chart: Which founding / core country is not like the others, at all? Italy. The Italian bar contrasts strikingly with the bars for Poland and Germany, which are similar indeed. So you have two rather unsuccessful countries spoiling for a fight. As to the Denmark bar, something is rotten in Denmark. Let us pray that akvavit consumption drops. And Italy is going its own way, as I watch the news and read the papers. Everyone from well-established Giuseppe Conte and most Five Stars, plus Marco Tarquinio in the Partito Democratico, to commentators like Alessandro di Battista and supposed alt-right (but more of a populist anarchist) Pubble are pushing Italy in another direction. And then there’s the Pope Factor. No wonder Giorgia Meloni is at CPAC telling the Elect that Italy is for sale and for plunder. Long term, she’s short term. PS: Noting the AfD’s figures, and noting Linke’s resurrection, I am reminded of a map that I saw today of results. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_German_federal_election#/media/File:2025_German_federal_election.svg This is what happens when the oh-so-rational Germans have economic integration (merge and purge) without considering social and political integration. The old East asserts itself. Bavaria is extremely conservative. Conserving what? The right to have illegitimate children? According to the Catholic Encyclopaedia, 14.01% of all births in Bavaria around 1890 were illegitimate, second to only Austria with 14.67%. Given her petite stature, she cannot possible see too far ahead… Some very high heels would be useful. Could get to be Putin’s height… Judging by the trajectory of the Sweden Democrats in Sweden, AfD will fill the following function: – say no to NATO until the vote when they immediately say yes. AfD will not help Germany to leave this destructive organization. – do not care about sovereignity because they voted yes to the defence agreement cooperation = surrender your territorial sovereignity. AfD will not tell the USA to deoccupy the country. – use immigrants as a scapegoat for all the ills in the country and attract voters with this argument – continue to inflict neoliberal pain on society to maintain and/or increase voter support because of immigrants causing all ills of the world – toe the lines of the zionist lobby and the US and neocons Goals stated to SD by a zionist lobbyist https://x.com/Johnpatrick500/status/1889794786959241408 2024 petitions from Sweden Democrats (SD) Petition from SD to the Swedish government to withdraw support to UNRWA https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/motion/indraget-bistand-till-unrwa_hc02225/ Petition from SD to move the capital to Jerusalem https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/motion/erkannande-av-jerusalem-som-israels-huvudstad_hb0259/ Petition from SD to cut all aid to Palestine https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/motion/upphorande-av-bistand-till-palestina-och-en_hc02386/ Petition from SD to cut diplomatic relations with Palestine https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/skriftlig-fraga/diplomatiska-atgarder-efter-palestinskt-stod-till_hb111057/ These far-right parties are definitely completely detached from the idea of sovereignity. Larry Johnson put some pen to this too: Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), is a war hawk and is likely to push anti-Russian policies. Fortunately, with only 28% of the vote, he lacks a mandate to up the ante and risk war with Russia. The political fissures that divide the German people mean that their country, once considered a powerhouse in Europe, will become irrelevant. https://sonar21.com/german-election-results-signals-more-chaos-ahead/ It’s now been two decades since I last visited Europe, and I spent quite a bit of time there in the 80s and 90s: I longed to return, but now I’m thinking I’d rather keep my memories as they are. As a Romanian, I say that it cannot happen to nicer people. Prior to WWII, Germany forced Romania via the Vienna Dicktat to cede the Northern Transylvania to Hungary, which was the downpayment to have Hungary join in the coming fight against USSR (likely it was not in the small print, otherwise Hungary would have rather taken the chance to stay neutral and maybe get the Austrian treatment after war). Then, with the non-agression treaty with USSR, Germany winked-winked, nod-noded for USSR to take over Basarabia from Romania (and of course the free hands in the Baltic and Finland, which was to be just provisional). This ensured that Romania would join Germany in the attack against USSR in June 1941, to recover lost territory. And the attitude towards the genocide in the Occupied territories… It cannot happen with nicer people… I don’t think anyone in Eastern Europe is feeling sorry for the Germans. German ideological infections are highly resistant to rationality treatment. However, the national recovery from near death in 1945 was quite vigorous. We can only hope that the return of realism in Germany does not require a similar degree of suffering. Germany needs to pull the EU together and lead an independent foreign policy that establishes economic ties indifferent to U.S. geopolitical machinations. Thanks. Only one wrinkle I feel, overextending Russia will not. The 2019 RAND paper is lacking data and insight into the reality of Russian planning and conduct. In fact I would suggest it´s the other way around EU overextending especially with commitment on the Pacific frontline being expanded. The Russians have stepped up production of hypsersonic systems among others for this very reason. With current Zircon covering almost all of Europe. The entire arsenal is well known to readers here. And that´s just the tip of the iceberg. Almost none of what RAND suggested will work. And where it did with Syria, in the long run we will see how it actually plays out for the perpetrators of that mess. Besides by now Russia appears to have found a new base with Algeria. Not to speak of BRICS etc. But as I said last night, as Connor stresses above – there is noone in Germany in sight who admits this or would act according to it. Germany.is.doomed. I can only hope BSW will create a grassroots basis with doing streetworkers´ jobs to work up from there. Like the Communist Party did in the Autrian city of Graz. As of now they are “our last hope” to quote Princess Leia. And the massive swing voters movements are proof of how insecure people truly are. With China having the Russians´ back and Russia being self-sufficient on every possible level RAND was producing fairy-tales. Besides that report was based on data at least 6 years old. wow. That´s like a lightyear away. Thanks Conor for your essay on the “alternate reality” Germany lives in. The main topic of the election campaign was not – as someone with a glimpse of common sense would have guessed – the accelerated deindustrialization process bleeding Germanys industrial sector dry or the destruction of the – in former times – very reliable german energy system or the destructive proxy war fought in Ukraine costing hundred thousand of lives and billions of Euros but the stupid idea of firewalling the AfD (a party with roots in hayekian neoliberalism as well as national conservatism) out of the parliamentary process. With the “firewall” the entrenched interests of the established party cartel manages to keep away the AfD from the possibility of having immediate influence on government politics. The other party which could have been a threat for the existing party cartel – the left-conservative BSW – was smeared as “puppets of Putin” by the MSM and – to make things worse – undermined itself by agreeing to government coalitions with cartel parties in Thuringia and Brandenburg. Not only were economic questions sidelined during the election campaign, a huge part of the populace seems neither interested in economic policy nor informed about the dire straits the national economy is in. And in the short run there will be no change of this: The MSM – one of the main tools of the professional-managerial caste – is still very good at “manufacturing consent” and upholding the “alternate reality” Conor described so precisely. p.s. quick look into the 2019 RAND study and its initial verdict of the Russian military which I need not comment here further. Just looking into their quoted sources reveals how they are missing the crucial points albeit trying to not denigrate the enemy. Which with faux respect fed false hopes. What is most striking: how little Western – publicly available – studies have changed since. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3063.html “(…) The present-day Russian military is a capable, albeit uneven, fighting force. Its ground and air forces can dominate the country’s near abroad militarily, (…) The Kremlin also possesses a survivable strategic nuclear deterrent consisting of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-based ship-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and bombers with air-launched cruise missiles, along with a formidable arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons. Thanks to decades of sustained investment, Russia boasts advanced air defense capabilities. Compared with the United States (or the Soviet Union), Putin’s Russia has a limited ability to project force, but defeating it on its home turf would be extremely challenging and costly. Moreover, it maintains these capabilities with a defense budget comparable to that of several weaker military powers, (…) Western observers disagree over the level of Russian military leaders’ acceptance of such concepts as “hybrid warfare” and such proposals as “escalating to deescalate” with nuclear weapons, but the 2014 seizure of Crimea demonstrated the Russian military’s capability to wage an unconventional military campaign. (…) While much Russian military equipment still dates back to the Soviet period, Russia launched an ambitious modernization program at the beginning of the decade seeking to provide the military with “70 percent modern equipment by 2020.”18 While the post-Crimea budget crunch has forced the Kremlin to scale back these targets, generous funding in the early 2010s enabled substantial progress. (…) The Russian militaryindustrial complex has shown it can produce modern weapons, if only in relatively limited numbers. Certain systems favored by Russian decisionmakers have benefited from decades of sustained investment and are world class. The S-400 air-defense system and T-14 Armata tank are advanced systems with no U.S. counterpart, as is Russia’s family of mobile ground-based strategic nuclear launchers. (…) Much of Russia’s defense industry has been neglected since Soviet times and is in desperate need of capital modernization. Critical production facilities and suppliers are located in former Soviet republics that are now hostile to Russia, particularly Ukraine, necessitating costly substitution programs. Like the rest of the Russian economy, the military-industrial complex is afflicted by corruption, although this might not be particularly bad by Russian standards. Moreover, much of the defense industry is state-owned via large holding companies. Both Russian and Western critics often charge that isolation from market forces is a critical weakness of the Russian military-industrial complex, but it is far from clear that this presents a vulnerability that could be exploited by a cost-imposing strategy. Corrupt and inefficient as the Russian defense industry might be, the cost-control problems afflicting U.S. defense procurement are so large that the Russians are often highly competitive on a cost-comparison basis. Potential Vulnerabilities For all their strengths, the Russian military and defense industry still suffer from many vulnerabilities. Even though ground forces make up the bulk of the Russian military and are still using outdated equipment, the Russian defense budget deemphasizes them in comparison with other services. While the quality of the average Russian soldier and his equipment is improving, it still lags considerably behind U.S. standards. The need to recapitalize the defense industry and the inadequacy of available funds to do so have helped perpetuate these critical weaknesses. Such areas as surface shipbuilding are in parlous condition, contributing to an uneven modernization. Furthermore, the scientific and technical capital underlying Soviet military strength has atrophied, as have the human resources available to the Russian militaryindustrial complex. Finally, military spending has been more protected from the effects of Russia’s budget crisis than have other areas of the state budget, but it is likely only a matter of time before economic realities catch up with Moscow’s military ambitions. (…)” In fact the truth of how little they understood in 2019 (and apparently might still do to some extent) is buried in the very last 1,5 pages of the 277 page study. Even if not all assessments in the entire study are wrong they did regard Russia as a leightweight. With some horrible consequences to everyone but Russians. Implications and Recommendations for the US Army “(…) Ultimately, the task of “extending” Russia should not fall primarily to the U.S. Army or even the U.S. armed forces. Indeed, the most-promising ways to extend Russia—with the highest benefit, lowest risk, and greatest likelihood of success—probably fall in the economic and information domains rather in the military domain. Moreover, as this study has argued, Russia is not seeking military parity with the United States and might simply choose not to respond to some U.S. military actions (e.g., shifts in naval presence), while other U.S. military actions (e.g., posturing forces closer to Russia) could ultimately prove costlier to the United States than to Russia. Nonetheless, there are at least three major implications of this work for the U.S. Army. First, the Army should rebuild its expertise on all things Russian, including foreign area officers, linguists, and intelligence analysts. If Russia does indeed pose a long-term threat, then the U.S. Army needs to develop the human capital to engage in this strategic competition. Second, the Army should consider investing—and encouraging the other services to invest—more in the handful of capabilities (e.g., ATACMs, IFPC2, longer-range anti-air defense, and other systems designed to counter Russian A2AD capabilities) that could extend Russia. The U.S. Army also might consider spending some of its R&D resources on less mature, more futuristic systems (e.g., swarm unmanned aerial vehicles or remote ground vehicles). While these measures would likely be insufficient in and of themselves to extend Russia, they would benefit U.S. deterrence efforts and could augment a broader whole-of-government policy. Third, even if the U.S. Army is not directly involved in “extending Russia” per se, it will play a key role in mitigating the consequences. As already mentioned, all the measures to extend Russia incur some degree of risk. As a result, enhancing U.S. deterrence posture in Europe and increasing U.S. military capabilities (e.g., an enhanced Javelin or active protective systems for Army vehicles) might need to go hand-inhand with any move to extend Russia as a way of hedging against the possibility of tensions with Russia escalating into conflict. (…)” A key difference that is missing is the aspect of morale: it is very clear to Russian front-line fighters why they are there and what they a doing it for, where as aside from the remaining true-believing Azov troopers who are simply thrilled to be killing “orcs,” most Ukrainian troops would likely rather be elsewhere. I don’t have the stats, but I know that the USA forever wars helped demolish many a hundred, two hundred years family traditions of serving the nation by serving in the military. Many of the actual combat vets I’ve encountered from these seem pretty messy in the head and often have fairly high disability-ratings from the VA. I haven’t come across one yet who thinks “it was worth it.” Training will only carry one so far, and it’ll usually click on when SHTF, but over the longer-term motivation from fear alone will not carry one through– it becomes burn-out. What do our soldiers fight for, especially if there is no god, tradition is dead, and that those who run their country actually hate them? edit: I am seriously sorry, I seem to not learn that the correct spelling is CONOR!!! Not CONNOR as in Terminator´s LISA CONNOR. Germany´s biggest alternative news site NACHDENKSEITEN seems pretty devastated. They have 3 articles alone today filled with the tune of the doomed. “The BSW’s election defeat – a political disaster” ““I don’t know any parties anymore…!” – or: Requiem for a country” “Peace is the big election loser” It is interesting though that Germany´s pro forma most influential evening news TAGESSCHAU writes: “Millions of votes not represented in the Bundestag – “A little more than one in seven votes in the Bundestag election went to a party that will not be represented in the next Bundestag. According to the results of the counting of all constituencies, around 13.9 percent voted for a party that failed to clear the five percent hurdle. That corresponds to around 6.9 million votes” Add to that 17% of non-voters. There is a lot of potential there for BSW. BERLINER ZEITUNG with a commentary on Habeck: German version https://archive.is/x2kV1 The end of Robert Habeck: His power was more important to him than his political ideals After the election, the Green Party member quickly found the culprit for his failure: Friedrich Merz. But that is not true. It was Habeck’s will to power. A commentary. by Anja Reich On the day of Robert Habeck’s defeat, one could once again experience what had caused him to fail. It was election Sunday, between 6 and 7 p.m., the first projections were in, the Greens were at 13.3 percent, later they slipped to 11.6 percent, far below the expectations of the man who had stood to become Chancellor for the Greens. In interviews, Habeck was asked about the reasons for the Greens’ poor performance, and he had – well – an interesting explanation: Friedrich Merz is to blame. His vote in the Bundestag with the AfD. Green sympathizers had wished that he would never speak to the CDU again, said Habeck with a concerned expression. But that was not possible for him, Habeck. Because: “I can’t do that. I’m polarized differently, we’re polarized differently.” And then he added: “In that respect, we are now victims of Friedrich Merz’s voting behavior.” Robert Habeck – a victim of the CDU? The Green candidate for chancellor – a victim of the CDU? Because he stood by Friedrich Merz in a difficult hour? Against his own conscience? Anyone who followed Habeck’s election campaign must have thought at this point that the Vice Chancellor was suffering from memory loss. Let us remember what really happened after the much-discussed decision on the “Influx Limitation Act” on the last day of January this year. The CDU had introduced the proposal for the law to the Bundestag, knowing full well that the AfD would also vote for it. But contrary to expectations, not only the SPD and the Greens voted against it, but also some members of the FDP and the Union. The law failed. And Robert Habeck ? Seemed to be in a good mood. He wanted to become Chancellor, to beat Merz; he had started the election campaign in November with this unrealistic goal. And it became more and more unrealistic. The CDU was at 30 percent in the polls, the Greens around 15. But now, after the vote with the AfD, people took to the streets, even former Chancellor Angela Merkel stabbed Friedrich Merz in the back, the churches protested against him, half the country, it seemed. Robert Habeck wanted to depose Friedrich Merz from his poll throne Habeck’s tone towards the CDU suddenly became harsh and relentless. He accused Merz of breaking taboos and breaking his word. “Not once, but twice. Not by accident, but on purpose. Against all warnings,” he shouted at a campaign event in Cologne. The CDU candidate had disqualified himself for office. Habeck even had his election campaign changed: “One person. One word” became “One word broken. Hundreds of thousands of people.”, “Word instead of word broken,” “Habeck instead of Merz.” Just a few hours after the Bundestag vote, Habeck’s anti-Merz ad was already appearing on Spiegel Online and other websites. Something was happening, he announced, “from the depths of the soul of the country.” He wanted to become chancellor, to topple Merz from his poll throne. That was Habeck’s mindset. And nothing else. But the Greens’ figures did not improve, and Habeck’s plan to beat Merz did not work. And again he changed his strategy, his tone, drafted a ten-point paper himself to limit migration, offered himself to Merz, and said on Markus Lanz about the CDU’s vote with the AfD: “Mistakes can be healed.” There is more that the SPD and CDU have in common than what divides them. If not chancellor, then at least minister in a government with Merz and Scholz. That was the new plan. And many of Habeck’s supporters must have realized by now: The former do-gooder, the Greens’ great hope from the last election campaign, seemed to be primarily concerned with one thing: himself, with his position. Having power was more important to him than political ideals. Habeck’s last hope was the success of the BSW – of all things That is the case with many politicians. But Habeck’s bad luck was that the Left, led by the young East German Heidi Reichinneck and the former Greenpeace activist Jan van Aken, showed that there was another way: the uncompromising fight against the right, the commitment to left-wing ideals and green politics. The Left’s poll ratings shot up. The Greens warned against voting for them. In vain. In the end, the Left were the winners and the Greens the losers. And Robert Habeck also lost his direct mandate in the Flensburg-Schleswig constituency – to the CDU candidate. His last hope was, of all things, the Sahra Wagenknecht coalition, which Habeck had accused of being “bought by Russia” during the state election campaign. If the BSW had received more than five percent, the CDU would have needed the Greens as well as the SPD for a coalition, and they would have taken on government responsibility – and Robert Habeck would probably have become a minister. But the BSW did not make it. The CDU does not need the Greens for the government. On Monday, Habeck announced that he no longer wanted to take on a leadership role. An end that seems almost symptomatic of a man who for a long time no longer seemed to know what he stood for – or against. In the end, he was not dependent on the outcome of his politics, but on a party he despised. Regarding that comment about some BSW members crying foul over the vote of Germans living abroad – as one of the members of that particular club I’ve seen a noticeable amount of anecdata from Germans mostly living in the US and Canada that their ballot documents didn’t arrive in time or at all. Apparently that’s not unusual based on comments from some members of a forum I’m on, but it seemed worse this time. The way voting works for Germans abroad is that you need to get in touch with the town you were last registered to vote in and they’re supposed to mail you the ballots. The excuse this time around was that the local election offices didn’t get the final candidate lists until very late and had to rush the ballots to the printer and out the door. Given how long it can take to get a letter from Germany to the US, I’m expecting that a fair number of people will have received their ballots too late to send them back in time or will get them after the election. Not that this is a massive surprise for me as I’ve lived about half my life outside Germany and I didn’t get the impression that the bureaucracy is set up to deal with their citizens living abroad very well, at least not during the last quarter century. Did I vote? No. I fell foul of a law that states that one has to petition the Bundeswahlleiter for permission to vote if one lived abroad for more than 25 years. That tends to take a while from what I heard (would’ve been my first time) and with the short notice for the election, it wasn’t even feasible to go through that process and have the documents sent out in time. In NJ you can vote from Europe by email (with a printed copy as backup). I am disheartened by BSW’s near miss from entering the Bundestag — Sarha Wagenknecht offered something otherwise missing from the German political scene. Instead it looks like more “radical centrism” and a continuation of the policy failures of the German political establishment. Where there is no vision, the people perish … I am disheartened as well. I reckon we’re not the only two. Wasn’t she regularly polling in the teens? It looks like the flashy new Linke’s youth scene drained Sarah’s support just in the last months. Very disappointing, but one can hope that the trad Left will become useful again. AfD is quite useful to the establishment centrists and to the oligarchs, as has been explained in comments above. BSW and any serious popular left movement is a threat. “…And yet the priority is more weapons to fund an unwinnable war and prevent the Russians from conquering Europe — a threat for which there is still no evidence and makes no sense if you spend ten seconds thinking about it. But on the plus side from the perspective of the European vultures, it provides cover to continue dismantling the welfare state and privatize everything from infrastructure to social services…” “…The US and Russia could work out some rapprochement, which some in Washington believe will help with other wars in the Middle East, as well as the looming confrontation with China….” And if no war with China materializes, all that money was thrown at “AI” hype which is nearly ALWAYS presented needing to be urgently adopted “becuase China.” Three years in, couldn’t understand then and can see consequences now. I cannot fathom why anyone would favor fighting a war you are going to lose. FWIW Macron arrived at the White House today. Trump did not receive him at the entrance. Adam Tooze – a few of the statistics are in English via FT Deutschland 2025 – A live (and complicated) democracy. https://substack.com/@adamtooze/p-157799674 p.s. Democracy? Well I guess you can spin it in any way. Who can fail to be charmed by Lord Bebo’s clip of the delightful Annalena’s expression of joy at finally achieving the goal her grandfather shared with the Mustache Man and for which he so bravely continued to fight for at the Oder even after Germany’s unconditional surrender? I hazard that it takes a real man, a prime example of pure blooded German manhood, to continue committing war crimes long after the war is over. He, too, was probably a vegetarian who never killed a living creature for food. Regarding Annalena Baerbock’s €700 billion (yes, euros) for Ukraine, that money really looks like its coming. I know some people consider this to be some Russian disinformation, so here is a link to a pro-Ukraine news site telling the story: https://united24media.com/latest-news/europe-eyes-unprecedented-eur700-billion-military-aid-plan-for-ukraine-5981 (though the site credits Berliner Zeitung as the source) It isn’t just the war that is in favor of this package. The military support package is about the same size as the €750 billion NextGenerationEU (NGEU) programme, which was set up to help EU countries cope with the Covid pandemic, and was financed with EU common debt. The NGEU programme increased the EU debt from 50 billion to 300 billion, which not only made larger investments possible, but also made the EU a bigger player in the bond market. The NGEU programme will end in 2026, so the EU needs another similar package to maintain its economic influence. “Regarding Annalena Baerbock’s €700 billion (yes, euros) for Ukraine…” I thought this was sarcasm, but evidently a serious Western European proposal. To me, the reality would be self-destructive madness. On the hidden transformation of the German LEFT PARTY as the cause for its sudden “success”: German daily JUNGE WELT: https://archive.is/28kXW From: Issue of 25.02.2025 , page 3 / Focus 2025 federal election Left strengthens Western ties Triumphantly back: The Left Party owes its return to the Bundestag primarily to a change in preferences among the urban “progressive” electorate By Nico Popp If the Left Party’s 4.9 percent in the 2021 federal election marked the transition from the latent to the open party crisis, then the 8.8 percent (4.35 million votes) in the early federal election in 2025, or so it seems, represent its conclusion. Two months ago, after years of political and organizational decline and at three percent in the polls, still almost written off, the Left Party has managed a comeback that no one expected. No other party has made such gains in the election campaign, no other has gained so many members. The Left Party had actually based its election campaign on winning at least three direct mandates, because a second vote result of more than five percent was still considered almost unattainable at the turn of the year. In the end, the party won six constituencies directly, four of them in Berlin, where Die Linke was also the strongest force in terms of second votes with 19.9 percent. Co-party leader Ines Schwerdtner won the mandate in Berlin-Lichtenberg, Gregor Gysi in Treptow-Köpenick, Pascal Meiser in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and Ferat Koçak in Neukölln. Neukölln is the first “western constituency” that the party has ever won. In the Berlin-Mitte and Berlin-Pankow constituencies, the Left Party candidates were only narrowly defeated by the Green candidates. The former Thuringian Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow won the Erfurt-Weimar-Weimarer Land II constituency, Sören Pellmann again won the Leipzig II constituency (the only Saxon constituency that did not go to the AfD). What happened here? Clearly, in the middle of the ongoing election campaign, a political constellation arose that was extremely favorable for the party, but which the party did not bring about itself. This constellation has resulted in considerable parts of the urban “progressive” electorate, who have voted for the Greens for decades (and in some cases for the SPD or Volt in the 2024 European elections), but who nevertheless steadfastly maintain the self-image of being “left,” making the transition to the Left Party – albeit only at the last minute and against the very specific background of the election campaign focusing on the interrelated issues of migration and dealing with the AfD. Pascal Meiser’s victory in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, which had long been considered a Green “model constituency,” is exemplary in this respect, and was not anticipated by anyone in the party just a week or two ago. This development is particularly striking when contrasted with the finding that the election campaign focused on social policy issues in the party’s old strongholds, the eastern German states or a former 50 percent constituency such as Marzahn-Hellersdorf, has not led to a return to previous highs. Here, the party has at best slightly improved on the comparatively poor result of 2021. The sudden and steep rise was driven by significant gains in the western German states (and especially in the big cities), where the party has recently performed disastrously. On Sunday, however, it also climbed above five percent in Bavaria, Rhineland-Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein, i.e. in large states that were previously considered particularly “difficult” for the party. The party was particularly successful here and elsewhere in constituencies with university towns, where the Greens have long been the main winners. In the Münster constituency, for example, Die Linke received an above-average 12.5 percent of the second vote (plus 7.5 percentage points), in Bonn 12.5 percent (plus seven), and in Freiburg 13.9 percent (plus seven). Overall, the individual state results of the Left Party in the West and in the East are no longer so far apart. This is a first in the party’s history, in which the success (or failure) in a federal election always depended on the result in the East German states and in which, even in the phase of the party’s initial successes, such as the 2009 federal election, the gap between the results in the West and the East was very large – not to mention the PDS years, when the votes were almost exclusively obtained in the East and repeated attempts to “expand” to the West failed. This chapter now seems to be finally closed – the former strongholds in the East are no longer there, but the party has prospects of approaching ten percent of the vote in the western German states under favorable conditions. The focus of the party’s voters and members has shifted to the West. With this election, the party apparatus has achieved two long-held goals: breaking into the “progressive” electorate of the Greens and SPD and at the same time reducing dependence on the old strongholds in the East. The attempt to stabilize this state of affairs by further forcing political and programmatic adjustments to the new clientele will not be long in coming. addendum to the article: Background: More crosses The early federal election has at least brought about a moderate repoliticization: the non-voter bloc, which had grown to almost a quarter of those eligible to vote in federal elections, has shrunk somewhat. 82.5 percent of those eligible to vote – 49.9 million – cast their vote this time (2021: 76.6 percent). This is the highest voter turnout since the GDR was incorporated into the Federal Republic in 1990. The lowest voter turnout was recorded on Sunday at 77.7 percent in Saxony-Anhalt, the highest at 84.5 percent in Bavaria. According to the preliminary results published by the Federal Returning Officer on Monday, the Union won the election. The CDU and CSU together received 28.6 percent of the second votes, while the AfD, which almost doubled its 2021 result, received 20.8 percent. They were followed by the SPD (16.4 percent), which fell by almost ten percentage points, Alliance 90/The Greens (11.6 percent) and the Left Party with 8.8 percent. The FDP, which played a key role in bringing about the end of the traffic light government in November 2024, is no longer a member of the Bundestag with 4.3 percent. It has lost about two-thirds of its 2021 vote share. The BSW, which entered the race for the first time in a federal election, narrowly failed to clear the five percent hurdle. On Monday, the Federal Returning Officer reported 4.972 percent of the vote (2.46 million votes) for the party; in the end, it was about 13,400 votes short. The party performed above average in eastern Germany – best with 11.2 percent in Saxony-Anhalt, where it also finished ahead of the Left Party (10.8 percent). The party also achieved double-digit results in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. It is striking that the party only received 9.4 percent in Thuringia, where it had received 15.8 percent in the state elections in September 2024 – so entering a coalition with the CDU and SPD cost a lot of votes. Another key factor in the narrow failure was that the party remained below five percent everywhere in the west, with the exception of Saarland. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous federal state, 4.1 percent of voters voted for the BSW. In the Bundestag, which has shrunk to 630 seats as a result of the traffic light coalition’s “electoral reform”, the Union parties have 208 seats, the AfD 152, the SPD 120, the Greens 85 and The Left 64. In addition, there is a single representative from the SSW. Apart from the AfD, with which no party wants to work together, the Union, as the strongest force, only has a parliamentary majority with the SPD. Popps article analyzes the surge of the party “The Left” correctly: “considerable parts of the urban “progressive” electorate, who have voted for the Greens for decades (and in some cases for the SPD or Volt in the 2024 European elections), but who nevertheless steadfastly maintain the self-image of being “left,” making the transition to the Left Party”. Estimated 700.000 voters flocked from “The Greens” to “The left”. That means: it is a borrowed success. The “Left” abandoned their old working class base in exchange for the academic salon bourgeoisie. The latter tends to look for moral purity instead of material interests based on the respective position in the economic process. It is to expect that this “greened left” will act like “The Greens” and say yes to “project Ukraine”, to “no borders/no nations” and to the neoliberal-authoritarian EU.

Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images In the summer of 2024, I noted that the stock market was likely to move higher. However, the big tech leaders were seen as too extended and overvalued. This group was due for a correction. If the market was to move higher and the tech leaders were to correct, then other lagging stocks would have to start outperforming, which has been the case. Let us take a closer look. The relative strength of the equally-weighted NASDAQ versus the S&P 500 turned up in late December and remains strong. This indicates that the average stock in the NASDAQ 100 is stronger than the cap-weighted S&P 500. The big-cap tech stocks have been lagging while the smaller weights in the index have been rising. The result: Many more stocks are rising but the equities that have the greatest influence on the indices have lagged. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in 2024 in which only 25% of the stocks outperformed the S&P 500. Note the rising relative strength as denoted by the green line. The relative strength screen shows that within the NASDAQ 100, the big eight tech stocks are ranked from No. 6 (Netflix) to No. 75 (Microsoft). Here are the stocks in relative strength order with the cycles recommendations in parentheses: Netflix (hold) Meta Platforms (sell) Tesla (buy) Nvidia (sell) Amazon (sell) Apple (hold) Google (sell) Microsoft (cycle low in March) This monthly cycle graph explains the buy signal on Tesla. This accurate monthly cycle points to higher prices through 2025. Here is another graph that explains the sell opinion on Nvidia: This cycle peaked at the price high and points down though the year. The top five NASDAQ current relative performers are: 1. Palantir 2. Super Micro Systems 3. Axon 4. Atlassian 5. DoorDash Some of these stocks are extremely overbought and too risky to buy now. From these new leaders, here are two stocks that can be added to portfolios. Super Micro came down hard, and is now giving longer-term buy signals, supported by rising cycles. There are weekly buy signals and a very oversold monthly price. Atlassian features technical strength and a rising monthly cycle. Use the pullback in this cycle and any NASDAQ weakness to accumulate shares. The cycle rises from March to June.

Nvidia (NVDA-2.20%) is expected to release its fiscal fourth quarter earnings results at the end of the trading day on Wednesday. The chipmaker’s stock was down 4% to $134.40 per share at Friday’s market close. The company is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.35%). Net income is estimated to be $19.6 billion for the quarter ended in January, while analysts are expecting earnings of $0.85 per share. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, during its last report. FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first quarter guidance at $42 billion. After Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based AI startup released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. Earlier this month, however, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM-2.47%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. Therefore, Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia’s stock experienced an extended rally last week and has recovered about 90% of the value lost during the sell-off. In a note on Friday, Jefferies (JEF-1.41%) analysts noted Nvidia’s stock rally but said it “has been relatively range bound” since November due to fears from the broader market over “a slower ramp in Blackwell shipments.” Despite concerns over supply chain issues for Blackwell, Jefferies analysts said they “believe” Nvidia will deliver a beat and a raise, although “the magnitude is likely to be smaller than the typical $2-3B range.” “We continue to like NVDA during product ramps,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that it expects “the beats to reaccelerate” in the second half of the year as Blackwell continues to expand.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Nobody’s honest. Scientists are not honest. And people usually believe that they are. That makes it worse. By honest I don’t mean that you only tell what’s true. But you make clear the entire situation. You make clear all the information that is required for somebody else who is intelligent to make up their mind” — Richard Feynman “The Unscientific Age”, The Meaning of It All (1998) Number of the Week: 29,000 THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW will continue with questioning whether climate science is a physical science. TWTW begins with a discussion of omitting physical evidence by the UN IPCC. Then it discusses the importance of the Greenhouse Effect. TWTW discusses a report that Earth’s albedo is changing. Then it discusses a report by Ross McKitrick that some advocates of the so-called social cost of carbon omitted key evidence. A controversy at the Royal Society is discussed, followed by an essay by David Legates explaining why the vaunted Hydrogen Economy is not materializing. TWTW concludes with a discussion on the failure of the green energy transition. ********************* Is It Science? For years, organizations have used the term science to sanctify their political actions. Some of these organizations even have the term science in their names, others are government organizations funded with the intent for providing physical evidence for certain concerns, such as weather. Most researchers are no doubt scrupulous, but some, such as James Hansen, may deceive themselves. Others seek funding for advancement and to profit from it. But in physical science the ultimate and final judge, nature, is impartial. All ideas and theories must be tested against what nature reveals to us, physical evidence from observation and experiment. To SEPP this is what is meant by applying the scientific method. And those ideas and theories which fail to meet the test must be discarded. Unfortunately, a common practice among researchers who are less than scrupulous is omitting data (physical evidence) that contradicts the desired conclusion. As Stephen McIntyre has demonstrated repeatedly, this practice was common to the so-called hockey-stick. It was featured in the reports of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [particularly the Third Assessment Report (AR3 or TAR, 2001)]. [The cover of the TAR Synthesis Report: Summary for Policymakers has been altered in recent versions, however the hockey-stick style shape (of roughly stable temperatures between the year 1000 to 1900 then sharply increasing temperatures and projections thereafter to 2100) can be seen in Figure SPM-10b: Variations of the Earth’s surface temperature: years 1000 to 2100.] Click to access spm.pdf To call such reports “science” is misleading. It is not physical science and some of the findings are contradicted by physical evidence. The contradicting physical evidence is omitted in such reports. However, it is common practice in the political game called “science” to label such reports as “science” — without mentioning the omitted physical evidence. This game is commonly practiced in the US and Europe. The integrity of all of physical science is tarnished by such efforts. *********************** Importance of the Greenhouse Effect: The UN IPCC and its collaborators have condemned carbon dioxide by speculating about possible harmful effects of increasing carbon dioxide and its greenhouse effect. Their publications seldom mention the benefits of the primary greenhouse gas, water vapor, without which we probably would not have life on Earth. Nor do they mention the benefits of the secondary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, which is essential for providing carbohydrates, the food source for all complex plants and animals. Their publications omit any benefits of the greenhouse effect itself. Starting with experiments in 1859, John Tyndall was the first to produce evidence that what he called greenhouse gases are critical for life on Earth. Without them the land masses of Earth would become too cold at night to support life as we know it. Growing plants would freeze every night. To understand the importance of the greenhouse effect for life, one needs only to compare the temperatures on Mars with those on Earth. Mars is about 1.5 times farther from the Sun than Earth. Thus, the solar radiant energy hitting it is less intense. But Earth has an albedo (reflective power) of about 30% reflecting solar radiation back to space, primarily from clouds and ice. Mars has an average albedo of around 16% primarily from dust and the composition of its surface. The daily rotation of Mars is about 24 hours and 37 minutes, a little less than 40 minutes longer than that of Earth. But it is the temperature range at the equator that is interesting. At the equator on Earth, the average daytime temperature is about 31°C (88°F). The average nighttime temperature is about 23°C (73°F). Thus, the average temperature range between daytime and nighttime is about 8°C (15°F). [Note there are other estimates that tend to give a smaller range.] At the equator on Mars daytime temperatures are around 20°C (70°F); the average nighttime temperature is about minus 70 °C (-94°F). Obviously, such cold on Earth would kill growing plants. Furthermore, although the atmosphere on Mars is thin, it is about 95% carbon dioxide. So, the runaway greenhouse effect is not occurring. https://www.space.com/16907-what-is-the-temperature-of-mars.html Some researchers such Carl Sagan falsely assumed such an effect is occurring on Venus. The overwhelming amount of the atmosphere on Venus is greenhouse gases, and the atmospheric pressure is about 92 times that on earth. If we had Venus’s quantity of greenhouse gases, they would amount to: CO2, 89,000,000 ppm (in other words 89 times our atmosphere in-toto; sulfur dioxide (SO2), 13,800 ppm; H2O, 1840 ppm, carbon monoxide (CO) 1560 ppm; hydrogen chloride (HCl), 30 ppm. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus The Greenhouse Effect is vital for life on Earth; without it the planet would be too cold to support life. Further, the two significant greenhouse gases, water vapor and carbon dioxide along with sunlight for photosynthesis provide carbohydrates (simple sugars), the food source for all complex plants and animals. Thanks to modern technology, we are measuring the greenhouse effect in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Calculations of the greenhouse effect by van Wijngaarden and Happer using the HITRAN database agree well with measurements at various latitudes made by satellites. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer *********************** Earth’s Changing Albedo? In August, Geomatics published a paper by Ned Nikolov and Karl F. Zeller titled “Roles of Earth’s Albedo Variations and Top-of-the-Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in Recent Warming: New Insights from Satellite and Surface Observations.” The abstract states: “Past studies have reported a decreasing planetary albedo and an increasing absorption of solar radiation by Earth since the early 1980s, and especially since 2000. This should have contributed to the observed surface warming. However, the magnitude of such solar contribution is presently unknown, and the question of whether or not an enhanced uptake of shortwave energy by the planet represents positive feedback to an initial warming induced by rising greenhouse-gas concentrations has not conclusively been answered. The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also did not properly assess this issue. Here, we quantify the effect of the observed albedo decrease on Earth’s Global Surface Air Temperature (GSAT) since 2000 using measurements by the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project and a novel climate-sensitivity model derived from independent NASA planetary data by employing objective rules of calculus. Our analysis revealed that the observed decrease of planetary albedo along with reported variations of the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) explain 100% of the global warming trend and 83% of the GSAT interannual variability as documented by six satellite- and ground-based monitoring systems over the past 24 years. Changes in Earth’s cloud albedo emerged as the dominant driver of GSAT, while TSI only played a marginal role. The new climate sensitivity model also helped us analyze the physical nature of the Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI) calculated as a difference between absorbed shortwave and outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere. Observations and model calculations revealed that EEI results from a quasi-adiabatic attenuation of surface energy fluxes traveling through a field of decreasing air pressure with altitude. In other words, the adiabatic dissipation of thermal kinetic energy in ascending air parcels gives rise to an apparent EEI, which does not represent “heat trapping” by increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases as currently assumed. We provide numerical evidence that the observed EEI has been misinterpreted as a source of energy gain by the Earth system on multidecadal time scales.” [Boldface added] In other words, the increase in warming that has occurred since 2000 may be from a small decrease in cloudiness, not from an increase in CO2. The CERES project, designed to measure the earth’s energy imbalance by measuring solar intensity, albedo, and outgoing IR, concluded that the “Large ASR [Absorbed Solar Radiation] trend [is] primarily driven by reductions in low and middle clouds. (https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/documents/STM/2023-05/15_Loeb Contributed_Science_Presentation_2023.pdf) As explained by AMO physicists William van Wijngaarden and William Happer, a 1% decrease in cloudiness can cause a warming equal to that of a doubling in CO2. Further, John Robson discusses a paper by Swiss scientists suggesting sunlight hitting the earth is increasing, first from a reduction in Soviet era pollution, then from an overall decrease in cloudiness. [Robson did not link to the paper.] See links under Science: Is the Sun Rising? and Commentary: Is the Sun Rising? *********************** More Omissions: During the Biden Administration a group of economists decided to increase the mythical Social Cost of Carbon (Dioxide) (SCC). Econometrician Ross McKitrick examined their work and wrote a paper “Extended crop yield meta-analysis data do not support upward SCC revision” published by Nature, Scientific Reports. The abstract states: “The Biden Administration raised its Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimate about fivefold based in part on global crop yield decline projections estimated on a meta-analysis data base first published in 2014. The data set contains 1722 records, but half were missing at least one variable (usually the change in CO2) so only 862 were available for multivariate regression modeling. By re-examining the underlying sources, I was able to recover 360 records and increase the sample size to 1222. Reanalysis on the larger data set yields very different results. While the original smaller data set implies yield declines of all crop types even at low levels of warming, on the full data set global average yield changes are zero or positive even out to 5 °C warming.” [Boldface added] Judith Curry’s Climate Etc. had a post by McKitrick which explains his work in some detail. The background sections states: “In 2023 a team of economists working for the Biden Administration concluded the SCC needed to be increased by a considerable amount. The higher the SCC, the costlier the regulatory burden that can be justified by the agency. This not only affected US regulations but Canada’s as well since our own environment ministry adopted the new US values when justifying a sweeping set of new greenhouse gas regulations. I wrote an op-ed about the SCC change in May 2023 in which I drew attention to the important role played by a revision to projected agricultural yield damages. While it is difficult to trace where, precisely, all the changes came from, I estimate about $50 of an approximately $100 increase in the 2030 value of the SCC (holding the discount rate constant) was attributable to the revised agricultural yield damage estimates. These revisions were attributed to estimates of crop yield losses from a 2017 paper published in Nature Communications by Frances Moore et al. called “New science of climate change impacts on agriculture implies higher social cost of carbon.” I’ll call that paper M17. I was familiar with this paper because Kevin Dayaratna and I had studied it while preparing a response to a comment by Philip Meyer on a paper of ours on the SCC. I knew, for instance, that M17 used a data set originally developed for a 2014 paper published in Nature Climate Change by Andy Challinor et al. called “A meta-analysis of crop yield under climate change and adaptation.” I’ll refer to that one as C14. But C14 and M17 had different implications about the impact of CO2-induced warming on crop yields. In the C14 model CO2 fertilization offsets the damage from warming, whereas in M17 the combined effect is negative for most crops across most warming paths. So why the difference? It was not possible to tell simply by reading the papers. Neither one provided a detailed explanation of its regression analysis. M17, in particular, did not report its regression results nor was its model directly comparable to C14. So, in 2023 I decided to get the data and try to replicate both sets of findings. While both papers said the data was available online at a website called http://www.ag-impacts.org no such site currently exists, and the Wayback machine entries did not include any data. I emailed Moore to ask for her data, but she was at that time working for the Biden Administration and her university email was inactive. I then reached out to Challinor who replied promptly and sent me his data set.” McKitrick explains the misleading dataset he terms as C14. He then explains the slow review process in which his paper was rejected by Nature Climate Change and the slow review by Nature Scientific Reports. The paper was finally published by Nature Scientific Reports on February 15, after the new US administration took office. McKitrick states: “Of course, the topic has now been rendered somewhat moot by the Trump Administration’s January 20 Executive Order suspending the SCC on the grounds that it is “marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation.” The EPA has until mid-March to issue guidance on how to address these problems including possibly scraping the use of the SCC altogether. I have had no contact with people working on that undertaking but if any of them were to ask me I would tell them the following. Measuring the SCC is not a scientific procedure akin to measuring the weight of an atom or the speed of light. The SCC is based on so-called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that contain countless assumptions and yield complicated “if-then” statements. If the following assumptions are true, then a ton of CO2 emissions will cause $X worth of damage to the world. Whoever gets to pick the “If” statements determine what the “then” statement will be. And you can pick studies that guarantee any SCC value you like, although some are more plausible than others. Ultimately the SCC is determined by the political and social process of choosing who gets to write the report. The Biden-era SCC report was written by people whose antennae were up for any reasons whatsoever to boost the SCC estimate, and who ignored evidence pointing in the other direction. The report even warns the reader that they probably overlooked many reasons why the SCC is even higher than they have estimated because surely there are many other damages associated with CO2 that they have not yet thought of. (They claimed to have taken account of the benefits associated with CO2 fertilization in one of their two IAMs, but they did so based on the M17 analysis. Which means, in effect, they didn’t take it into account.) From an economic perspective, the dirty little secret of climate policy is that CO2 emission reductions are so costly, even if the US government accepted the Biden SCC estimate very few climate policies would survive a cost-benefit test, and if the SCC were lowered to something more reasonable none of them would. So, in that sense climate activists will get no joy from hanging onto the SCC. But beyond the question of what the magic SCC number should be, the bigger question is how you convince a bureaucracy not to rig the report-writing process. The 2013 Interagency Working Group SCC report boasted of consulting 11 separate government agencies, and the 2023 report additionally boasted of input from the National Academies of Science and outside expert reviewers. Yawn. The more agencies involved the less scrutiny a report gets. It is all but certain that no one checked any underlying data or undertook any replication work. And I know from experience in the IPCC and other bureaucratic processes that review comments going against a chapter author’s biases are ignored or argued away, while comments confirming an author’s biases are welcomed at face value. The scientific establishment has resisted all attempts to fix climate assessment processes because they always got to pick the authors. But now a very different team is going to do the picking. If the establishment grandees suddenly decide they don’t like the process, they should have said something sooner.”[Boldface added] See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy *********************** Which Science? Episodes such as the one experienced by McKitrick prompt one to ask: when organizations speak of science, what type of science are they referring to: Is it the science of using the scientific method to test all ideas against nature, or the science of omitting key physical evidence that contradicts the proposed idea or theory? The Royal Society is the oldest science society in the world. Elon Musk is a fellow. Jo Nova links to an article in the journal Nature which states; “The Royal Society in London has called a meeting to discuss the behavior of fellows after a growing campaign by scientists over the membership of Elon Musk. The meeting, scheduled for 3 March, comes after more than 1,300 scientists signed an open letter expressing “deep concerns” about the conduct of billionaire Musk, who is a fellow. Musk is working closely with US President Donald Trump on sweeping government reforms that threaten flagship US research programs and are causing havoc for scientists in the United States and globally. He is also accused of spreading misinformation on the social-media site X, which he owns. Two Royal Society fellows have resigned over the institution’s perceived lack of action over Musk’s behavior in recent months. ‘It is tarnishing their reputation and to some degree devalues the honor of awarding fellowships. Does one want to be associated to a society that does not stand up for its values?’ says Stephen Curry, a retired structural biologist at Imperial College London, who wrote the letter and published it on his blog on 11 February.” The Imperial College London harbors World Weather Attribution (WWA) which without physical evidence attributes severe weather events to increasing carbon dioxide. Further, Musk and his team are exposing significant funding of highly questionable political organizations in the name of science. The question is, which type of science are these members defending: the science that tests all ideas against physical evidence? or the “science” that omits key physical evidence to make a political assertion? Nova writes: “The Royal Society acts every day more and more like a trade union for approved priests of science. They reveal their small mindedness in so many ways. They accuse Musk of ‘attacking public sciences’ which begs the question of what a public science is? Is that different to real science? Or has the Royal Society totally forgotten that science is a process and not a government institution? The original full name of the Society was ‘The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge’ and no one on Earth is doing more to improve natural knowledge than Elon Musk is. And the reason he can do so much, so fast, is surely because he is funding it all himself, not waiting for government approval, appeasing bureaucrats, or cringing before ‘science’ committees with magical fashionable keywords like diversity. Musk should quit the Royal Society because it has forgotten what science is The Royal Society doesn’t know it, but they desperately need Elon Musk. The Royal Society has become nothing more than a workers’ union for government funded technicians dressed in lab coats, and he’s the greatest private scientist in the world today. He is the antidote to government funded paralysis in science (and in so many ways). Consensus ‘scientists’ are just a paid marketing wing of Big Government — captured by the monopolistic funding. The Royal Society needs Elon much more than Elon needs the Royal Society. He should quit now, before they hold their sanctimonious meeting. *UPDATE: Quitting? Nah. It only makes the Thought Police happy. Unless he has the time to excoriate them properly on the way out, it’s so much better to let them dig their own hole in public, then come crawling back when he gets to Mars. Besides, Elon has 218 million followers on X – If he wanted to set up a Society of Scientists — ones who care about the scientific method, he could do it tomorrow.” See links under Lowering Standards and Funding Issues. *********************** Failed Magic Fuel: SEPP director David Legates, and member of the Cornwall Alliance, has an essay on Master Resource “Hydrogen Energy: Not Clean, Green, Cheap.” He clearly explains the major problems involved in attempting to use hydrogen as a fuel. First, on Earth it is not a fuel. There are no hydrogen mines or fields that can be drilled. It must be extracted from H2O, natural gas (primarily CH4,) or other hydrogen compounds, at considerable cost in energy. There is significant energy loss involved in production. Second it is difficult to store because it turns most metals brittle. Third, it is difficult to transport. Fourth, it is difficult to use, it is extremely explosive. Legates concludes with: “Not Cheap Finally, the fourth hurdle should now be obvious. The use of hydrogen as a fuel source is expensive—in terms of production cost, expensive storage, and energy required to produce. Hydrogen as a fuel source will allow virtue signalers to claim they have developed and are using a ‘clean and green’ fuel source that is ‘saving the planet from the evils of fossil fuels.’ But in reality, it is only going to make energy more expensive and send a larger proportion of the planet back below the poverty line. As we have often stated here at the Cornwall Alliance, inexpensive energy has been the solution to raising billions of people above the poverty line and increasing their standard of living. Hydrogen energy will cease to become viable when the subsidies provided to it by governments of the world dry up. Hopefully, the new Administration will recognize that hydrogen embrittlement applies not just to metals, but to our economy as well.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Article #1 for the bankruptcy of the electric and hydrogen truck manufacturer Nikola. *********************** An Unraveling: Planning Engineer Russ Schussler has an essay in Climate Etc. which takes apart the erroneous thinking behind the failing green energy transition. He writes: “The purpose of this article is to summarize and debunk many of the issues in the narrative surrounding the proposed green energy transition as applies to the electric grid. The issues are so numerous that this piece is at once both too long and too short. A full unraveling deserves a book or series of books. This posting, however, challenges the narrative through summary comments with links to previous posts and articles which can be read for a more detailed explanation or for greater depth. The Narrative Efforts to hasten a ‘green transition’ find support in a powerful and compelling narrative. The following statements are widely believed, embraced and supported by various ‘experts’, a large part of the public and far too many policy makers: Schussler then debunks these claims. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *********************** Number of the Week: 29,000 According to the German newspaper DW translated into English: Germany has expanded wind and solar energy but failed to cut back on fossil fuel use in the transport sector. Environmental issues did not feature prominently in the election campaign — unlike the last time around. The head of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz — who, according to the polls, is most likely to become the next German chancellor — has often said that Germany’s approximately 29,000 electricity-generating wind turbines are a thorn in his side. In November 2024, Merz told public broadcaster ZDF, “I even believe that if we do things right, we can one day dismantle the wind turbines again — because they are ugly.” When a high-pressure system settles over Northern Europe in the winter, producing cold, still nights; 29,000 turbines produce little electricity for Germany.

Conclusion The NCA can reform its current image as a political tool by presenting the total picture—considering both threats and opportunities, incorporating exposure and vulnerability into disaster cost analyses, leveraging systematic review methods, and communicating findings in an objective, data-centric manner. These reforms would not only make the report more useful but also allow it to be more robust to pendulum swings between administrations. [SEPP Comment: Under the current structure, it is doubtful that the United States Global Change Research Program’s (USGCRP) National Climate Assessment (NCA) is worth saving. Recent severe weather events probably have nothing to do with climate change.

By Rachel Cleetus, Policy Director with the Climate and Energy program, Union of Concerned Scientists, Feb 18, 2025 If Lee Zeldin is looking for a recent authoritative assessment of the science, he should turn to the 2023 Fifth US National Climate Assessment, produced under the direction of the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates that the USGCRP—which collaborates across 15 federal agencies—deliver a report to Congress and the President at least every four years. Another valuable source is the IPCC sixth assessment report, which reflects the work of thousands of scientists around the world—including many from the United States—in assessing the latest climate science, impacts, and opportunities to cut heat-trapping emissions and adapt to climate change.

It also said it would “scale up efforts to improve energy efficiency and increase renewable energy.” Rather than support coal projects, the bank said it would “scale up its work helping countries develop national and regional markets for natural gas, the fossil fuel with the lowest carbon intensity.” But two years later, the bank backtracked on natural gas and said it would stop all lending for oil and gas projects “except under exceptional circumstances.” Since then, the bank, which claims its “role is to reduce poverty by lending money to the governments of its poorer members to improve their economies and to improve the standard of living of their people,” has lost its collective mind.

They did a very, very small-scale [demonstration] of actual power beaming from orbit down to the surface a couple years ago. And what we’re actually seeing right now is that in the next five years, we’re going to have the first on-orbit power-beaming demonstrations, again, focusing on lasers, because that’s where a lot of the DOD interest is right now, and that’s where the actual funding is. But we’re going to see that you’ll have those initial demonstrators, and if you start having a market, especially for space-to-space power beaming, that could happen a lot sooner than people think, because you don’t need to have very large systems for that. Just having several kilowatts would be really helpful for certain types of applications.” [SEPP Comment: A possible source of power that may prove to be very practical in areas with few clouds, but a bit impractical perhaps for planes or birds passing through the intense beams. In the 60s (?) the idea was to beam down microwaves at about 200 W/m2, roughly 5% of that of a microwave oven, and covering large areas where the microwaves would be efficiently absorbed by “rectennas.”] Solar Energy Is Not Competitive with Fossil Fuels By Norman Rogers, Real Clear Energy, Feb 18, 2025 The size of power plants is often expressed by the maximum number of megawatts of power they are capable of delivering, called the nameplate rating. The average power delivery is less. For a natural gas plant, it is possible to generate an average power of near 100 percent of the nameplate. The plant can run continuously except for maintenance pauses. But for a solar plant the maximum capacity factor is about 25 percent in sunny areas. The low-capacity factor of solar plants, that mainly work in the middle of the day, is the reason solar is so expensive.

NASA’s 2022 DART mission proved that spacecraft can successfully alter an asteroid’s path, and scientists have theorized other methods, such as using lasers to create thrust by vaporizing part of the surface, pulling it off course with a spacecraft’s gravity, or even using nuclear explosions as a last resort.

Nikola’s EV Truck Dream Goes Bust Another green industrial-policy project enters Chapter 11. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, Feb. 19, 2025 TWTW Summary: The editorial begins with: “Another green-energy unicorn died Wednesday as Nikola Corp., the electric-truck startup, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its spectacular market crash is another warning about the perils of industrial policy and chasing government subsidies. The 11-year-old EV maker aspired to be the Tesla of trucks. Nikola went public in June 2020 through a blank-check merger amid the euphoric pandemic stock-market recovery and Democratic promises of a Green New Deal. It fetched a $27 billion market valuation that at the time was greater than Ford’s even though Nikola had sold no vehicles. Supposedly sophisticated investors were taken in by its marketing hype. General Motors announced on Sept. 8, 2020, that it was taking an 11% stake in Nikola, which CEO Mary Barra hailed as an “industry leading disrupter.” It was disruptive in a different way. In January 2018 Nikola posted a video on Twitter of its model truck appearing to power effortlessly down a flat road with the caption: “The Nikola Hydrogen Electric trucks will take on any semi-truck and outperform them in every category; weight, acceleration, stopping, safety and features—all with 500-1,000-mile range!” That would be a revolutionary—if true. It wasn’t. According to a 2021 federal fraud indictment of founder Trevor Milton, an inoperable prototype was towed to the top of a hill. Then Nikola employees released the brakes so it looked like it was cruising along. All the while the door was taped shut to keep it from falling off, and its batteries were removed to prevent the truck from catching fire. After taking investors for a ride, Mr. Milton was convicted in 2022. Nikola’s marketing deceptions and problems spooked investors. Nikola in 2023 recalled 209 battery-electric trucks owing to fires. As of last October, it had sold fewer than 500 trucks—and at a heavy loss. Nikola reportedly had sold hydrogen trucks for $351,000 — about half what it cost to produce them, though its sales price was still about twice as much as an internal-combustion-engine semi. This was financially unsustainable, especially amid higher interest rates. California regulators and the Biden Administration tried to boost the electric-truck market with mandates and subsidies. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a $40,000 tax credit for buyers of electric trucks. An Environmental Protection Agency rule last spring requires that electric models make up 25% of long-haul tractor sales by 2032. But the government still couldn’t induce truckers to buy them. “Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our ability to operate,” Nikola CEO Stephen Girsky said on Wednesday. Translation: High costs and technological limitations make EVs impractical for long-distance trucking operations.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Despite the tanking of the economy by divers means, mainly taxation, some are still prepared to engage in blatant doublethink. Recently Guido had this: “Rachel Reeves has been warned she must “urgently” boost the economy after her tax hikes triggered the sharpest collapse in business output and profits since the pandemic. A damning report from the CBI predicts another significant fall in private sector activity over the next three months (-23%), with the “pessimism widespread” https://order-order.com/2025/01/27/british-businesses-sees-biggest-hit-to-profit-and-output-since-covid/ That same CBI says… “Britain’s net zero economy is booming, CBI says Green sector growing at triple the rate of the UK economy, providing high-wage jobs and increasing energy security … The analysis showed economic growth and climate action go together, said the report’s authors, and improve lives and livelihoods. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/britain-net-zero-economy-booming-cbi-green-sector-jobs-energy-security On the one hand an economy going into needless recession and on the other a boom in green… To quote Rachel from Accounts: “There is no tradeoff between economic growth and net zero. Quite the opposite. Net zero is the industrial opportunity of the 21st century” And to quote John Lennon: “Just gimme some truth”. “Most researchers are no doubt scrupulous” I’m not this is true (any more). At every level they are encouraged to be less than truthful. This starts with funding proposals, in which they feel compelled to exaggerate, often wildly, the significance and impact of what they propose. The buzzwords change constantly, eg “paradigm shifting” becomes so yesterday and is replaced by “transformative” or some other vacuous term. The publication process has become a game. It is not to be taken seriously. It’s difficult to get informed, balanced, intelligent reviews any more in most journals, especially the interdisciplinary journals. Reviewers are often antagonistic for no reason, frequently ignorant of the techniques employed, and unable to judge the merits or spot fundamental flaws. This makes the process somewhat of a lottery, with of course some biases. Editors don’t by and large make editorial decisions any longer. They hide behind reviewers without bothering to make sense of comments and responses themselves. With the right recipe in terms of topic, techniques and writing style, it’s perfectly possible to get papers into top journals often by simply bamboozling reviewers with technical jargon and exaggerated claims. Just keep submitting and some will slip through. If you look more closely, you will find most papers suffer from outright fakery or data manipulation, or lies by omission. For example, there are countless papers in so called top journals like Nature using machine learning, especially deep learning, in which it is obvious that the authors don’t understand the techniques, have applied them to ill suited problems, and have misinterpreted or manipulated the results. This sort of thing would be resoundingly mocked by a specialist journal as an example of what not to do. Do the authors know what they’re doing? Of course they do. The PhDs, postdocs and supervisors are all aware that they shouldn’t be using techniques they don’t fully understand, but they do it anyway to ride the the latest fashion. By the way, I don’t blame the junior ones too much, this is the culture in which they’ve been trained and come of age . This is the sort of dishonesty that is most common, and it is rife. The more serious dishonesty (plagiarism, fake data) is much rarer. The entire academic system from the focus on funding over scholarship to the corruption of journals and scientific bodies will not be easily fixed. I don’t see how it can be. Academia has attracted and awarded the wrong sort of person in the past 20 years or more. The non scholar, a natural manager rather than a researcher. These types are in charge of universities, journals editorial boards and scientific panels and bodies. These people got to where they are by focusing on the things universities value (money), moving in the right circles, timing their bandwagon jumping to perfection and by exploiting the talents of others. They have redifined what it is to be a scientist to some degree. Doing research yourself has become anathema, a waste of your valuable time, which ought to be spent polishing the funding proposal written by your postdoc. I find endeavours like retractionwatch a bit laughable. They focus on one symptom of the disease, ignoring the root cause, and manage to catch a few small fry Indians and Chinese who are playing the game devised by people operating in a different stratosphere, occasionally catching out some big names Moreover, they engage in the same sort of censorship of views that don’t fit within the consensus. At heart, they are just another parasitic organisation set up to get whatever riches they can extract can from modern day ‘science’ Vert astute observations Abbas. 🙂 When did university media departments start acting as the critical influence on research projects, results and publication? It seems to me that media releases are orchestrated even before the print on abstracts is dry these days. I don’t think that happens to be honest. They are reactive, any good news will be exploited for maximum publicity, but they play no part in the publication process. A lot of it is self promotion, driven by the academics themselves, especially on social media. Horribly narcissistic Self promotion and marketing yourself can be key to fast promotion. This is the modern way. You don’t say as a young academic I want to solve X and Y outstanding problems in my area. You pick a fashionable topic, put some spin on it to make it sound novel then aggressively market yourself internally and externally as some world leader in this thing This transparently shameless tactic can get you known by senior management – they just love this kind of thing. Combine this with good funding success and you’re on your way to fast promotion before you’ve even learned to tie your shoelaces as far as the actual research is concerned. These days it’s not good enough to be good at research and well respected in your field. It’s not easy for senior management to see that. You need a ‘vision’. Visions are things I have in my sleep, or if I were to hallucinate on acid. Real research is not needed when you have a vision. The idea goes like this. First pick the journals in which you want to publish. Then pick suitable topics and techniques. Then find some idea and keep polishing it until your turd looks like gold, and you make sure to keep repeating that it’s gold, a new kind of special gold never before discovered, more golden and shiny than conventional gold. Submit. Get all your PhDs doing this. Let them learn from each other In the old days we picked the challenges we wanted to work on, rather than the journals we wanted to publish in. People tended to publish in more specialised journals. You couldn’t bs, couldn’t bamboozle. The reviewers were experts and you couldn’t fool them all. Yes, people made claims to big up their research, but this was done in a measured way. Nobody was claiming to have revolutionised anything, unless they really did “Starting with experiments in 1859, John Tyndall was the first to produce evidence that what he called greenhouse gases are critical for life on Earth.” I’m willing to bet you can’t quote Tyndall referring to “greenhouse gases” – because he didn’t. Tyndall pointed out that without an atmosphere, plant life (and hence human life) would not be able to survive the low nighttime temperatures which would occur. Conversely, daytime maximum surface temperatures would exceed the boiling point of water. Just like the Moon! Tyndall was never silly enough to claim that increasing the amount of CO2 in air would increase the temperature. I suggest anyone who thinks I am wrong, to read “Heat – a mode of motion”, which Tyndall continuously revised after each addition, as his knowledge increased. I continue to be surprised at some of the ideas attributed to John Tyndall which are contradicted by what he wrote. But hey, others know what Tyndall thought, better than his thoughts expressed in his written work. I only know what he wrote. That’s enough for me. I’ve asked this before but I think it warrants repeating. Am I missing something with regard to the use of hydrogen as a fuel/ As I understand it, the by-product of burning hydrogen is water vapour, which apparently is a worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. if that’s the case (and you believe that greenhouse gasses are responsible for global warming), then what is the rationale for burning hydrogen in the first place? Alan, you’re right of course: But the UN agenda is to control the energy so to direct societies toward “progressive” ends. So it’s all about accounting for reductions in CO2 and CH4. It’s worse. Steam reformation I believe is still the only way to produce hydrogen at scale. 27% CO2 or something. The puny bits of so called green hydrogen, eg from concentrated solar, are probably not worth the effort when taking into account the whole process involved in production and transportation. Do not try to make sense of it, this would be a mistake. For goodness sake we now even have a war on nitrogen The primary source of atmospheric water vapor is evaporation from surface water which covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface. Any added contribution from human activity is trivial. Since water vapor continually condenses and evaporates at rates controlled by temperature and pressure to try and maintain a local quasi-equilibrium, the effect of any added water vapor on atmospheric concentration is not predictable. As explained by AMO physicists William van Wijngaarden and William Happer, a 1% decrease in cloudiness can cause a warming equal to that of a doubling in CO2. You don’t say? Scientists discover unexpected decline in global ocean evaporation amid rising sea temperatures While the decreasing trend in ocean evaporation may seem counterintuitive in the context of global warming, it highlights the complexity of Earth’s climate system and the intricate feedback mechanisms that govern the planet’s hydrological processes. It sure does sound counterintuitive with the global boiling narrative but it depends on the Fruitloops giving the feedback and blowing wind up my ass that they’ve got a handle on all that settled science.

Meta said that the increase aims to bring executive compensation in line with other major technology firms. It’s worth pointing out that Meta announced an increase in executive bonuses soon after it laid off nearly 3,600 employees, which is around five percent of its total workforce. Furthermore, the company has also decided to reduce its annual distribution of stock options for thousands of its regular employees. Under the new plan, Meta executives will earn a yearly bonus of 200 percent of their base salary in 2025, which is a massive jump from 75 percent last year. A committee for Meta’s board of directors approved the change in bonuses on February 13th, on the grounds that the “target total cash compensation” for its executives “was at or below the 15th percentile of target total compensation of executives holding similar positions” at rival companies. The social media giant has increased these bonuses while it is in the process of laying off five percent of its global workforce. This is despite the fact that Meta’s shares were nearly 50 percent higher over the past year, with a current stock price of nearly around $687 per share. Furthermore, the company recently announced that its fourth-quarter revenue increased 21 percent year-on-year to more than $48 billion. It’s worth mentioning that Meta has cut more than 20,000 jobs in the past few years. While Meta executives will enjoy their fat bonuses this year, the company’s regular employees will suffer. The company has slashed its annual distribution of stock options by roughly around 10 percent for its regular employees, reports The Financial Times. The exact reduction in the stock options could differ depending on where the employees are located and what their roles are in the organization. That said, the new bonus and stock plans will take effect from the 2025 performance cycle. As per a filing, the new bonus plan doesn’t apply to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. However, he doesn’t have to worry about his bottom line as he’s worth nearly $250 billion. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Alibaba is going all in on trying to beat the US at developing AI that can reason like a human being
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-share-price-china-ecommerce-ai-agi-tech-markets-deepseek-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-24T07:13:27Z
Full Content:
Hot stock Alibaba has set its sights beyond AI to focus on artificial general intelligence, or AGI. "We aim to continue to develop models that extend the boundaries of intelligence," said Eddie Wu, Alibaba's CEO, on Thursday. He called the pursuit of AGI the company's "first and foremost goal." AGI is AI technology that mimics human intelligence to the point that it can achieve complex cognitive tasks involving logic and reasoning. US-based companies working toward AGI include OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Masayoshi Son, the CEO of major AI investor SoftBank, said earlier this month that he expects AGI to arrive "much earlier" than his late-2024 forecast of two to three years. Wu's statement came after Alibaba released blockbuster results on Thursday. For the quarter ending in December, Alibaba posted an 8% rise in revenue to 280.2 billion yuan, or $38.6 billion. Profit rose to 48.9 billion yuan, beating analysts' expectations. "The pursuit of AGI can contribute immense business value," said Wu, citing studies indicating that AGI — when achieved — could replace or achieve 80% of human capabilities. He said about 50% of global GDP comes from wages for blue- and white-collar work. "If AGI can be achieved, then that could have a tremendous impact in terms of the restructuring industry around the world. It could have a significant influence on or even replace 50% of global GDP," he said. On Monday, Alibaba announced that it's planning to invest at least 380 billion Chinese yuan, or $53 billion, in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years. The company is in a crowded global race for AI supremacy as US tech giants ramp up their AI spending. According to recent earnings reports, the combined capital expenditures of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are set to exceed $320 billion in 2025. Amazon is leading the charge, with over $100 billion earmarked for capital expenditures this year. The vast majority will go toward expanding Amazon Web Services and scaling AI infrastructure, the company said. However, the dramatic rise of DeepSeek, which released a new cost-competitive AI model last month, has thrown Chinese tech companies into the spotlight and caused investors to question whether massive Big Tech AI investments are justified. US-listed Alibaba shares are up 70% this year to date, thanks to the boost from DeepSeek and after Alibaba announced that it was working with Apple to incorporate its AI into iPhones in China. The upswing marks a major turnaround after Beijing's yearslong Big Tech regulatory crackdown, when cofounder Jack Ma's tech empire came under intense scrutiny. Last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with the country's top tech leaders — including Ma — in a sign that the country's private sector is now back in favor again. The market is viewing the meeting as a possible end of the crackdown. The Chinese government is seemingly working to revive an economy disrupted by a pandemic, regulatory crackdowns, and a real estate crisis, wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a note last week following the event. On Monday, Hong Kong-listed Alibaba shares were 2.5% lower by midday after recent gains and as Asian stocks were broadly pressured by sharp losses in the US markets on Friday. Jump to

Title: Software engineering job openings hit five-year low? - The Pragmatic Engineer
URL: https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineer-jobs-five-year-low/
Time Published: 2025-02-24T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
Hi, this is Gergely with a bonus issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover topics related to Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. This article is an excerpt from last week's The Pulse, issue – full subscribers received the below details seven days ago. To get articles like this in your inbox, subscribe here. Many subscribers expense the newsletter – if you have a learning & development budget, here's an email you could send to your manager. Before we start: despite the below stats, the tech market is not all gloom and doom! This week, we covered pockets of the tech industry that are seeing more demand than before in the issue State of the startup and scaleup hiring markets – as seen by recruiters. Interesting data from jobs site Indeed shows the change in the number of active software developer job listings on the site. For context, Indeed is the largest job aggregator portal in the US and in several countries, and it crawls vacancies on other sites, too. This means that Indeed aims to track most of the posted jobs across a given region (via crawling and processing them) – not just the ones companies pay to post on Indeed. The overall picture looks pretty grim, right now: Since February 2020, Indeed has shared aggregated statistics on the number of active jobs listings, taking January 2020 to be 100%, as a reference. Facts about software developer jobs on Indeed: Indeed tracks international job markets, too. Canada has virtually the same graph as the US. Things are different in the UK, France, Germany, and Australia: Trends look similar across the world. Australia’s growth in software engineer positions is eye-catching because it’s higher, and it’s the only country where the number of jobs listed is not lower than in 2020. Section 174 — the accounting change effective from 2023, mandating software engineering costs to be amortised over 5 years is most likely to result in fewer software developer jobs in the US, as we have previously analyzed. The drop in jobs somewhat lines up with when this change became effective. However, Section 174 only impacts the US and US-headquarters companies. its impact would only be visible from early 2024 — and the drop since 2022 can in no way be attributed to it. Section 174 changes also do not explain why countries the UK and France see a similar drop in job postings. This suggests that although Section 174 changes in the US surely have an impact: this accounting rule change is not the main driver of this drop. What about the number of total jobs in other industries? The data: Across Indeed, 10% more jobs are listed today in February 2025 than were in February 2020. There are 35% fewer listings for software developers. Let’s dig a little deeper into which other industries are also experiencing a drop: The change in the number of listings in 2025, compared to 2020, for each of these areas: Hospitality and tourism openings are also down by 18%. Overall, software developer jobs have seen the biggest boom and bust in vacancies. No other segment saw hiring more than double in 2022; only banking came close. At the same time, hiring has fallen faster in software development in the last 2-3 years than anywhere else So, which areas have grown since 2020? Several sectors saw job listings go up, significantly: Growth rates compared to five years ago: The numbers don’t lie, job listings for devs have plummeted. There’s a few potential reasons why: Interest rate changes explain most of the drop. The end of zero percent interest rates is a mega-trend that affects many things across the economy since 2022, including hiring, the steep fall in VC funding, and how many tech startups survive, thrive, or die. But it doesn’t explain why highly profitable Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon or Google have slowed down their hiring, or the large layoffs in recent years at tech’s biggest workplaces. The tech sector seems to react to sudden events with more intensity than any other industry. There is no other industry that started to hire in the frenzy than the tech industry did in 2022 – and then no other industry cut back hiring in 2024-2025. Let’s compare it with the industry that had the second-largest hiring boom during COVID: banking and finance. The job posting slowdown could partially be explained by how much more tech companies hired during the pandemic-era boom, and that companies are well-staffed thanks to that boom. Of course, we cannot deny that developer jobs – as well as banking jobs – are underperforming, compared to job listings across the economy: GenAI impact – yay or nay? We know first-hand that coding is an area in which Large Language Models are really helpful. Indeed, would it be so surprising if coding goes on to become the single best area of all that LLMs thrive in? The discipline looks tailor-made for it: Could tech companies be hiring less thanks to anticipating productivity boost that GenAI tools could bring for existing engineers? I don’t really buy this logic: but I can see how several companies could do a “wait and see” approach, slowing down hiring or even pausing it while they gather more data. A perception that engineering is no longer a bottleneck could be a reason for lower hiring. As covered in January, Salesforce will keep software engineering headcount flat because it’s seen a 30% productivity gain from AI tools. Salesforce has an interest in making AI productivity sound compelling because it sells an AI offering called Agentforce, and the company can afford to hire 1,000 additional salespeople to sell its new products it’s built. This suggests there’s substance in the reported productivity gain; Salesforce might be building software faster than it can sell it. Playing the devil’s advocate, this also raises the possibility that Salesforce isn’t building the right products, if it needs to hire more agents to sell its products, despite already having a strong distribution network and partnerships. Still too many engineers, after overrecruitment in 2021-2022? The period was the hottest tech jobs market of all time, and companies hired at a record pace. In 2023, widespread layoffs followed. Sluggish hiring today could be an indicator that companies still have enough “excess hires” from 2022. Perhaps some companies feel they hired too quickly before, and are going slower now. Are smaller teams more efficient? The two companies below hire slowly, and have small engineering teams: Could we be approaching the point at which building products is simpler to do for one or two engineers? Not because of LLMs, but how languages like Typescript allow working across the backend and frontend (using e.g. Node.js on the backend and React and React Native on the frontend and web). Of course, LLMs make onboarding to different stacks easier than ever. Consider how Indeed job postings will not be fully accurate data. There is a fair chance that Indeed is becoming less popular as a destination to post jobs – especially software engineering jobs – and that Indeed is either not crawling, or banned from crawling them. For example, Indeed lists a total of 663 jobs from Microsoft – however, Microsoft has more than 1,000 jobs just with the words “software” in them listed. I also struggled to find several startup jobs advertised on sites like Workatastartup (the job board for Y Combinator companies) listed on Indeed. I suspect that Indeed’s data should be directionally correct, and there are indeed fewer developer job listings than before. But I don’t think this data is representative enough of startup hiring, and it probably doesn’t track Big Tech hiring all that well either. Data shows that in 2023, the number of software engineers dropped for the first time in 20 years, fuelled by layoffs. It’s predicted that growth in the tech industry is likely to be low this year, and most certainly well below growth between 2011-2021 growth. I see a few possibilities: Smaller engineering teams get more productive. This is the optimistic outlook, where LLMs add a big boost to both individual and team productivity, which leads to more engineering teams being spun up, across the industry. More startups could be founded, and traditional companies could bring development in-house. The industry stagnates / shrinks. In this pessimistic outlook, even as software becomes cheaper to produce with fewer engineers needed, companies produce the same software, but with fewer people. This also assume entrepreneurs will not jump at the opportunity to build their ideas more efficiently – and much cheaper than before! I cannot see the scenario of the shrinking industry playing out – not with good software missing from so many parts of the world, and building better software being a big business opportunity in some many other industries. LLMs make software development more accessible for non-developers: I’m sure that LLMs are a leading cause of the fall in software developer job postings: there’s uncertainty at large companies about whether to hire as fast as previously, given the productivity hype around AI tooling, and businesses are opting to “wait and see” by slowing down recruitment, as a result. Startups are finding that smaller teams are working fine, and that it pays off to hire slower – as Linear and Bluesky are doing – and to avoid the “hyperscaling” approach of hiring first and asking what the new workers will actually do, later. Big Tech will hire slower than before, and I don’t see startups speeding up hiring. What’s missing is an answer to the question: how much new software will be created by non-developers using AI tools, for which a lot more developers will be needed to grow and maintain those new solutions?

Some elections are hard to fathom. Amid a wave migrant attacks, greenie energy devastation costing the country its global competitiveness, and a surge of populist conservative victories from political upstarts elsewhere -- in Italy, Netherlands, and other parts of Europe, as well as the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina, Germany opted for the same-old stale conservatives who brought them to the state of where they are. According to NBC News: BERLIN — Germany woke Monday to the aftermath of a bruising election in which the center-right conservatives won the most votes and far-right nationalists surged to huge gains, causing dismay in a country deeply wary of its Nazi past. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is under surveillance by German intelligence over suspected far-right extremism, experienced its largest-ever share of the vote, garnering the support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump administration. Merz is very much a globalist: GERMANY - The Globalists win again. New chancellor Friedrich Merz is their perfect pick. âªï¸Ex Chairman of Blackrock Germany âªï¸Dedicated to deeper EU integration âªï¸member of the WEF’s Board of Trustees âªï¸ regular atendee WEF in Davos âªï¸attended Bilderberg Group meetings… pic.twitter.com/kkG3hPwTfw — Bernie (@Artemisfornow) February 24, 2025 Sure, they threw a nest of leftist vipers out, which I suppose is an improvement. The far-left SPD trashed Germany's energy production in the name of going green, mismanaged the country's economy, spent up a storm, left Germany a military weakling, and opened the country's borders to the absolute bottom of the barrel in illegal immigrants, enforcing no laws against them, which has led to a string of terror attacks and a sea of crimes. presumably, the CDU/CSU, led by the inexperienced and unfortunately named Friedrich Merz (can we call you 'Fred'?), will hopefully clean up at least some of that. And on the bright side, NBC News described the results as "causing dismay," forgetting that every election has a winner and a loser and one of them is going to be unhappy. But the upstart AfD should have won, not the stodgy CDU/CSU, if Germany were ride the world's populist trend. Call me impatient, but they should have won. They could have joined the Trump-like nations, brought back law and order, thrown the illegals out, ended green nonsense, and restored their nation's greatness. Their moment seemed to be now, but they didn't win. Sure, they made gains, but they didn't win. How many times have we heard this kind of story in Europe? Germany just held their election. They require photo ID and use paper ballots. They hand-count the votes of each station one by one. No electronic voting machines due to security concerns. 50 million votes. It was all done in 8 hours. pic.twitter.com/542MgrGVXX — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) February 24, 2025 Worse still, Merz has stated that he plans to form a coalition with the outgoing SPD leftists, the third-place finishers who took 18% of the vote, their worst result in decades, bypassing the AfD because he considers them basically Nazis, ignoring that Nazis carried 'socialism' right there in their name as well as game. That pretty well means the socialists will be calling the shots, given the experience we know here in the states of RINOs aligning with leftists. They all go leftist when that happens. The AfD will be completely shut out of power, much as France's upstart party led by Marine Le Pen got that number pulled on them a couple years earlier. For us, the Germans will probably be a pain in the keister, with Merz stating he will distance himself from the U.S. If that means Germany pays its NATO bills and adopts a responsible energy policy, we can salute them anyway. If that means Germany gets rid of its open immigration and at least repatriates criminals, even better. But more likely, they will just obstruct the U.S. in the name of consensus or what the U.N. wants, making themselves a drag on the alliance. Elon Musk, who loudly supported AfD, noted that it was young people, particularly in the battered east, who supported AfD in the greatest numbers, meaning, the picture isn't entirely bleak -- the young people will continue to build strength for this party as the older, more cautious, generation dies off. As Rich Baehr has noted, movements take time to build strength and compared to the last election, this was impressive. The layered building of this party is continuing, much as has been seen elsewhere, because up until now, they were nowhere on the map. If the momentum continues, they will eventually win. But oh, it's so disappointing to see that, as Thomas Lifson once told us, the Germans "just want to be nice people." That seems to be the dynamic here, and one can only hope that for Germany, it's not too late to change course and become the dynamic nation they ought to be.

Title: An action plan for net-zero compatible with budget constraints

VLRS - stock.adobe.com When it comes to IT sustainability, the present economic uncertainty and political swings from diametrically opposite policies regarding climate change present a significant challenge to IT leaders. They require a technology roadmap to navigate these turbulent times robust enough to adapt to economic and political volatility. Sujata Kukreja, general counsel and chief compliance officer at network management platform Expereo, urges tech leaders to manage sustainability with innovation and take into consideration the running costs of inefficient datacentres. “We have to invest money and we are very conscious of datacentre energy consumption,” she says. Expereo therefore continues to prioritise emissions reduction, even if it’s costly. The procurement team increasingly seeks renewables-based arrangements. It’s about having a longer-term focus, especially with artificial intelligence (AI) tools coming in, says Kukreja. “But our investors are not going to continue if we’re not a business with purpose.” Another company that expects to continue to focus on emissions reduction and science-based targets despite economic pressures worsening in the past year is Crown Worldwide. Chris Davis-Pipe, chief information officer at the global logistics firm, commands a 70-strong enterprise IT team with 3,000 staff across business units in some 50 countries. “We’re working to get more visibility of the carbon we’re using and how to turn things off when we don’t want to use them,” says Davis-Pipe. “We stick solar on warehouses, we’re looking at using more renewable electricity, then we’re also moving from our own datacentres to more cloud-based services.” Customers increasingly demand information on emissions reduction, including a plan with science-based goals and demonstrable progress. Crown’s carbon-accounting platform has been calculating its carbon footprint, with 66% of estimated emissions accounted for by the end of 2023. It doesn’t plan to roll back the strategy, but it is buying more software and services off the shelf. In the past, it would have built its own. In-house IT skills have refocused on integration and data analytics, he says. Crown has also given countries and branches more leeway to improve IT environments locally – for instance, to achieve agility or efficiency within a governance framework. “We have core systems – main service delivery and financial systems – globally, but we’re much more open now for people to solve local issues locally,” Davis-Pipe explains. Automation and AI – beyond Copilot content in marketing – are also areas where the company is alert to future use cases that support the business and its net-zero goals, he says. Many firms may be in a similar position. Sarwar Khan, sustainability director at BT Group, reports that the company – and many of its partners and customers – are doubling down on net zero despite various pressures. “I sit in the business arm, with support for SMB [small and mid-sized business] customers, public sector, wholesale including channel partners. And the pressure to reduce [environmental] impact is not going away,” Khan confirms. “It’s a key priority.” While smaller businesses have “serious concerns” in terms of how they’re going to be sustainable and comply with net zero by 2050, they’re not backing off despite increasingly realising it’s an enormous task. Meanwhile, more specific key performance indicators (KPIs) on carbon, often revised quarterly, are appearing in the public sector. “SMBs are looking to big organisations, like us, to lead and support them,” says Khan. “In corporates, too, many are probably in that disillusionment phase, realising that they have to figure out how to operationalise it.” BT this year brought forward its annually reviewed net-zero target for the business to 2031, and for the customer and supply chain to 2041 – from 2050. How? “First, we looked at how we accelerate our plan on EV [electric vehicle] transition, as one of the largest fleet operators in the UK. Second, we looked closely at what we could reduce across our supply chain.” About 70% of BT emissions are Scope 3, so supply chain efficiencies are crucial. Tier 1 contracts are coming in for specific attention, he adds, and must have a science-based net-zero target against which they disclose performance. “If you don’t move the dial in that [Scope 3] space, getting to target is very difficult,” says Khan. BT is doing more advocacy – including alongside competitors – as well as looking at the make-up of its renewables certificates and power purchase agreements. Multiple innovations and efficiencies are crucial as datacentre power demand rises, Khan points out. Jon Healy, chief operating officer (COO) at datacentre solutions provider Keysource, reiterates that customers are shifting their net-zero strategies, including increasingly pushing suppliers to do more and reveal more rather than pulling back. Previously, some net-zero plans weren’t viable. “In our world, they’re not going to get more customers if they’re not addressing their own emissions. Of course, what’s difficult is to get there despite the pressures, including speed to market, constrained supply chains and demand for compute,” Healy maintains. “This has an impact right back to the drawing board, to strategic decision-making about where an organisation goes and which projects are fundamental.” Consequent designs have to underlie and underpin sustainability and carbon intensity, as well as support datacentre sector growth. Entire ecosystems are being evaluated. Upcoming infrastructure refreshes look likely to reap the benefits of currently evolving data, frameworks and metrics. “Companies must understand where their carbon emissions sit and what’s causing impacts or generating those emissions, and really pinpoint the detail to realise savings,” says Healy. Mary Jacques, director of global environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and regulatory compliance at Lenovo, agrees. It is continuing to focus on full carbon accounting, increasingly homing in on Scope 3 supplier emissions, partly in response to customer requirements across its portfolio. It’s not about taking your foot off the pedal temporarily in response to unfavourable economics, she says. With AI particularly, there’s demand to understand full impacts and help customers build up AI investments and infrastructure “in the right way”, Jacques adds. “These are long-term commitments by their nature,” she points out. “Ours, including the net-zero targets, remain the same.” Progress towards lower emissions continues under the surface of reports, commentators suggest. For example, bidirectional information flows between Lenovo, customers and suppliers are still developing, but ultimately, organisations will better quantify and reveal progress on emissions. Michael O’Hara, founder of not-for-profit support group Techies Go Green, is aware of economic pressures affecting organisational emissions reduction plans. That said, he believes what’s going on is more a readjustment of expectations and deflation of greenwash, even overhyped “green growth”. “It’s like in the 1990s – the internet was going to change how we did business, and there was huge investment, and then the dot com crash. But slowly, surely, the ‘enlightenment’ period happened, maybe 10 years later,” says O’Hara. “The sustainability hype kicked in after the 2016 Paris Agreement and Biden took office, and when BlackRock said they’d prioritise sustainability investments in 2020.” If he’s right, going green looks about halfway along. O’Hara says we can still see longer-term sustainability and profitability. Short-term thinking can be the enemy in business, as much as in politics with leaders only looking to their next election. “Among our members, there’s still positive sentiment, but there is a slowness in moving forward and putting in the investment. To be honest, a lot of [previous] net-zero goals have been too high,” O’Hara says. Over time, though, he expects emissions reduction to embed into company cultures, not least as data and transparency improve, with teams increasingly buying into the requirements. Until now, this has proven difficult in many companies, with sustainability sometimes tasked to the marketing person or receptionist, rather than someone with physical levers to pull. A lot of education and information communication still remains to be done as well. O’Hara points out that people are still joining Techies Go Green – it now has 650-plus members and targets 1,000. That suggests many still take emissions reduction seriously. Ben Brial, founder of green platform engineering company Cycloid, agrees there’s progress, especially on carbon accounting. Yet “short-cut” generative AI (GenAI) projects, such as China’s DeepSeek, should remind industry that alternative paths to innovation can exist beyond brute-force financial scaleup. “Prior to AI, many had this mindset about ‘we grow at any cost’. The goal was to go faster, regardless of resource use,” says Brial. But organisations can develop new, more economical, more sustainable methods and strategies, including in emissions reduction. “Cheaper is not new, but the idea of pushing to use less resources is kind of a new game-changer,” says Brial. “We can think our way to different solutions and ways of achieving our priorities, goals and objectives.”

Projects Images Products Folders AD Plus Benefits Archive Content Maps Audio Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is a comprehensive urban planning strategy aimed at creating dense, walkable, and vibrant neighborhoods centered around public transportation hubs. By seamlessly integrating residential, commercial, and recreational facilities within close proximity to transit nodes, TODs seek to reduce automobile dependency, increase public transit ridership, and stimulate local economic development. Government agencies play a pivotal role in supporting these developments through zoning reforms, easing floor area ratios (FARs), selling air rights, and facilitating public-private partnerships to secure capital for public infrastructure. While TODs have gained global traction, East Asia boasts some of the most successful examples. Conversely, efforts to replicate these models in different contexts—such as New York City—highlight the importance of adapting TOD principles to local conditions, geographical characteristics, and community needs.

High population density ensures steady transit ridership and foot traffic for new developments, making significant investments in public transportation and related developments economically viable. The region's commitment to modern technology and continuous infrastructure upgrades contributes to reliable, efficient transit systems, further reinforcing public reliance. In cities like Hong Kong and Singapore, policies also actively discourage private car ownership: Hong Kong imposes automobile taxes for new vehicles typically exceeding 80%, while Singapore requires a Certificate of Entitlement (COE) that can surpass USD 70,000 just to own a car. These measures make public transportation the practical choice for the majority of residents.

Mixed-use developments—combining residential, retail, office, hotel, and recreational functions—are a common feature, fostering neighborhoods that remain active throughout the day and night. Climate considerations also play a vital role; given the region's frequent hot and humid weather, TODs are designed to offer comfortable, climate-controlled environments, sometimes at the cost of unsustainable practices such as large-scale continuous air-conditioning. Far from being just transit points, these hubs serve as essential community spaces where people gather, shop, and socialize, thus embedding themselves into the fabric of daily urban life.

Related Article Twenty Years of Transforming Transportation: Where Are We Now? The Case of Hong Kong: Transit as Both Infrastructure and Refuge Hong Kong's TOD model is globally renowned for its efficiency and seamless integration of transit infrastructure with commercial and residential spaces. Major transit nodes such as Admiralty, Hong Kong Station, and Kowloon Station have evolved into vibrant, multifunctional hubs that serve both commuters and local residents. Admiralty Station, which opened in 1982, exemplifies this approach. Originally established as a key interchange between multiple subway lines and bus routes, the development encompassed multitude of economic activities and services. It encompasses large-scale shopping malls, world-class hotels, modern office towers, and access to essential public facilities, including courthouses and parks. Admiralty's continual evolution has reinforced its status as a critical transit nexus; today, the area hosts over four luxury hotels, serviced apartments, high-end retail spaces, and extensive office complexes, including one built by Paul Rudolph as well as Zaha Hadid's latest addition, all interconnected with an ever-expanding subway network.

Beyond commercially driven TODs, Hong Kong also demonstrates the effectiveness of residential-focused developments strategically positioned near transit hubs. Tai Koo Shing, completed in 1985, is a notable example. Adjacent to its namesake subway station, the development comprises 61 residential towers with more than 12,500 apartment units. This close proximity to reliable public transportation has significantly enhanced property values and improved the overall quality of urban living for residents. The success of Tai Koo Shing underscores a core principle of Hong Kong's TOD strategy: fostering convenient, high-density living environments that prioritize accessibility, economic vitality, and long-term urban sustainability.

The success of Tai Koo Shing underscores a core principle of Hong Kong's TOD strategy: fostering convenient, high-density living environments that prioritize accessibility, economic vitality, and long-term urban sustainability. One of the defining features of Hong Kong's TODs is their active climatic control as a response to the city's weather conditions. With summer temperatures often exceeding 33°C (91°F) and humidity levels nearing 90%, air-conditioned transit hubs provide essential relief for commuters. These conditioned indoor spaces become informal extensions of public life, offering places to meet friends, relax, or simply escape the sweltering heat while waiting for a train. These hubs double as vital communal areas in a city with scarce outdoor public space.

These hubs double as vital communal areas in a city with scarce outdoor public space. Hong Kong's success with TOD is largely driven by the "Rail + Property" model pioneered by the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation. By leveraging land development rights around transit stations, the MTR finances the expansion and upkeep of its rail network through co-developments or the sale of air rights for property projects. This approach ensures the functionality of TODs and fosters the creation of dense, mixed-use neighborhoods. The synergy between transit infrastructure and real estate development creates a sustainable, self-financing urban ecosystem where transit accessibility, commercial vitality, and residential convenience reinforce one another.

The Case of Japan: Connectivity, Convenience, and Community Japan's TODs are distinguished by their exceptional focus on connectivity and user convenience. Major transportation hubs such as Tokyo, Shinjuku, and Shibuya stations exemplify how transit nodes can evolve into vibrant, multifaceted urban centers. Tokyo Station, a key national gateway, successfully leveraged the sale of its air rights to neighboring developments, generating the capital necessary to fund an extensive rehabilitation and modernization project. This initiative revitalized its aging infrastructure while enhancing its role as a central transportation hub. Shinjuku Station—renowned as one of the world's busiest—attracted significant private investment through zoning incentives that allowed for increased floor area ratios (FAR). This policy enabled the integration of public amenities, cultural venues, and commercial enterprises within the station's complex, transforming it into a dynamic urban nexus. Meanwhile, Shibuya Station prioritizes pedestrian connectivity, employing multi-level walkways and carefully designed circulation routes to navigate its densely built surroundings, thus improving ease of movement for thousands of daily users.

Tokyo Station, a key national gateway, successfully leveraged the sale of its air rights to neighboring developments, generating the capital necessary to fund an extensive rehabilitation and modernization project. This initiative revitalized its aging infrastructure while enhancing its role as a central transportation hub. Shinjuku Station—renowned as one of the world's busiest—attracted significant private investment through zoning incentives that allowed for increased floor area ratios (FAR). This policy enabled the integration of public amenities, cultural venues, and commercial enterprises within the station's complex, transforming it into a dynamic urban nexus. Meanwhile, Shibuya Station prioritizes pedestrian connectivity, employing multi-level walkways and carefully designed circulation routes to navigate its densely built surroundings, thus improving ease of movement for thousands of daily users. Rail commuting is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, with many residents regularly traveling significant distances for work. For instance, the approximately 55-kilometer journey between Kyoto and Osaka takes a mere 25 minutes on conventional trains (not high-speed trains), making long-distance daily commutes both practical and common. This efficiency surpasses even that of other well-regarded transit systems like Hong Kong. Recognizing these commuting patterns, Japanese TODs are designed as comprehensive service hubs where commuters can shop, dine, and complete errands without deviating from their transit routes. These station complexes have become essential social spaces, frequently serving as meeting points for friends and family. The country's extensive high-speed rail network further reinforces this role. A trip from Tokyo to Hiroshima—spanning over 800 kilometers—takes just over four hours by train without the need for time-consuming security checks or prolonged boarding procedures. To put this in perspective, a similarly timed journey in the United States, such as the train ride from New York to Boston, covers less than half that distance at approximately only 350 kilometers. This stark contrast underscores Japan's exceptional integration of local and long-distance rail systems, positioning TODs as indispensable elements of the nation's urban and social fabric.

A Case Study in New York: When TOD Ambitions Meet Local Realities New York City's Hudson Yards project was envisioned as a flagship TOD, anchored by the extension of the No. 7 subway line. The development aimed to create a modern, mixed-use neighborhood featuring luxury residences, upscale retail, and expansive office spaces. While Hudson Yards has primarily succeeded in attracting major corporations such as BlackRock and Pfizer, other aspects have underperformed. Residential sales have lagged behind initial projections, and the high-end shopping mall—anchored initially by Neiman Marcus—has struggled with declining foot traffic, leading to the conversion of several retail spaces into office use.

Residential sales have lagged behind initial projections, and the high-end shopping mall—anchored initially by Neiman Marcus—has struggled with declining foot traffic, leading to the conversion of several retail spaces into office use. The shortcomings of Hudson Yards underscore the importance of contextual sensitivity in TOD planning. Unlike the integrated transit hubs of Hong Kong and Tokyo—where major TODs function as central nodes within a larger, interconnected network—Hudson Yards operates as the last stop of Manhattan's transit system. Despite being geographically central, its location on the west side lacks the seamless connectivity that characterizes successful TODs in East Asia. For example, in Hong Kong, the journey from the international airport to Kowloon Station takes less than 30 minutes, delivering passengers directly into a mixed-use district with offices, hotels, and residential towers above the transit hub. This convenience facilitates door-to-door international business travel and contributes to the area's vibrancy and commercial success. In contrast, Hudson Yards' comparatively limited transit connections and absence of efficient airport access hinder its appeal as a truly integrated transit destination.

Whereas East Asian TODs typically incorporate essential services, affordable retail, and accessible public spaces to attract a broad demographic, Hudson Yards emphasizes high-end retail and upscale dining, making it less relevant to everyday New Yorkers. This exclusivity undermines the broader community engagement that TODs strive to foster. Hudson Yards illustrates that the replication of TOD principles without careful adaptation to the local urban fabric, commuter habits, and socioeconomic diversity can limit a project's potential to become a positive, inclusive urban hub.

Context Matters: From Transit Nodes to Urban Ecosystems The success of TODs in Hong Kong and Japan demonstrates that effective transit-oriented developments do far more than simply erecting buildings near train stations. They seamlessly integrate transportation with residential, commercial, and social infrastructure while responding to local climate conditions, cultural commuting habits, and community needs. In contrast, Hudson Yards reveals how TODs have its flaws when architectural spectacle is prioritized over everyday functionality or when developments fail to embed themselves within existing urban systems and ridership patterns. Even in East Asia, TODs are not without shortcomings; mega-development proliferation risks displacing local communities and replacing rich urban fabric with homogenized retail environments and standardized residential towers. Such outcomes highlight the importance of balancing large-scale planning with sensitivity to existing neighborhoods and cultural heritage.

Each city's unique conditions—population density, governance structures, economic realities, and cultural expectations—must shape the design and implementation of TOD projects. TODs should be considered more than mere transit nodes; they should serve as integral parts of the urban ecosystem, enhancing quality of life, promoting inclusivity, and ensuring long-term resilience for diverse urban communities.

Title: Who Is Friedrich Merz, Poised to Be Germany's Next Chancellor
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-friedrich-merz-poised-to-be-germanys-next-chancellor-7780312

Full Content:
Friedrich Merz, a man who has never held a government role, is preparing to take the reins in Germany just as the country faces its biggest economic and diplomatic crises in decades and Europe looks urgently for a new generation of leaders for an era of transatlantic tension. Merz's conservatives came first in Germany's national election on Sunday, according to projected results, well ahead of their closest rival, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), giving him a mandate to form a coalition government. "Germany will once more be governed reliably," he told supporters on Sunday evening. The results spell an unlikely third-act triumph for the 69-year-old, who just seven years ago was seen as a failed politician fully reconciled to ending his career as a wealthy lobbyist and member of numerous company boards. A protege of the late Wolfgang Schaeuble, finance minister and icon of German fiscal conservatism, Merz enjoyed a meteoric rise through his Christian Democrats, becoming the party's parliamentary leader in the 2000s. Tall and with a sonorous voice, the arch-conservative Merz was a perfect figure for the party in 1989 - when he first won elected office for the European Parliament. Hailing from the Sauerland, a Catholic upland region in far western Germany known for its social conservatism and close-knit village communities, he embodied many of the virtues of West Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall - transatlanticist, business-oriented and socially conservative. However, reunification in 1990 allowed Angela Merkel, the East German daughter of a protestant pastor, to enter politics and elbow both Schaeuble and Merz aside on her rise to become chancellor. The east continues to be Merz's weak spot. A Forsa poll on Friday showed that unlike his Social Democrat and Green rivals, this distinctly Rhineland figure is still far less trusted in the east than the west. It is also the east that gave rise to the greatest challenge to Merz's authority in the guise of the far-right AfD, which took first place in one eastern regional election last year and could yet greatly constrain his ability to govern after the elections. Never the favourite of his party's professional advisers, Merz was twice rejected as Merkel's successor as party leader, in 2018 and 2021, before his doggedness won out in 2022. He took office pledging to kill off the nativist AfD by breaking with Merkel's centrism and moving the party rightwards. The AfD, on 10% when he took office, won some 20% in Sunday's election, according to projected results. "I want to do politics so that a party like the AfD is no longer needed in Germany," he told a congress of his conservatives in January, blaming the Social Democrat Scholz and his Green partners for creating the conditions that nurtured the AfD. In January, responding to two high-profile killings in which immigrants were the main suspects, he manoeuvred to get a resolution demanding a clampdown on migration through parliament, knowing that it would only pass with AfD support. Critics, even in his own ranks, saw this as an unforgivable breach of a political quarantine designed to keep the AfD out of power. For some, it was a case of Merz's strategic sense not matching the acute tactical skills that enabled him to repeatedly pin down Scholz, first with a 2022 visit to Kyiv that exposed the chancellor's hesitancy on supporting Ukraine, and then by getting a court to strike down a budget, setting in motion the chain of events that collapsed Scholz's government. The migration vote created a lingering sense of distrust, and fueled concerns that he may struggle to persuade other parties to govern with him, a necessity in Germany's proportional electoral system. "I don't want to suggest Merz plans (a coalition with the AfD), but I have to say my personal confidence that he won't do it after the election if that's his only way of becoming Chancellor - that's gone," said Ulf Buermeyer, host of the popular and influential podcast State of the Nation. Some internal critics grudgingly sense his Atlanticism, excellent spoken English and negotiating skills honed in the boardrooms in which he served during his political hiatus make him a good candidate for the Trump era. An early and outspoken backer of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia, he has said he would under some circumstances send Kyiv the high-end Taurus missiles that Scholz has always blocked. On fiscal policy, his policies are equally ill-defined, but he has suggested he is open to reforming constitutionally-enshrined debt limits that doomed Scholz's government and have hampered attempts to boost military spending. For all that, he is in many ways an old-fashioned figure from the time before he left politics for a lucrative second career at Blackrock that made the hobby pilot wealthy enough to own an aeroplane. Parts of his policy agenda are reactive: he has pledged to scrap an unemployment benefit and easier citizenship rules introduced by Scholz's coalition, and to introduce tougher border controls. He once told an interviewer that he would leave politics if it ever placed his 40-year-marriage, to Charlotte, a judge, under strain. "For me that price would be too high," he said. If he takes office, he will be the first chancellor with children, and the first not previously divorced, since Helmut Kohl left office in 1998. He has been assiduous about building contacts with the European leaders who would be his peers, with some welcoming the prospect of an end to Scholz's divided and indecisive government. "Almost undiplomatic," was how one European diplomat described the enthusiasm with which Paris was awaiting Merz's arrival. Last weekend's Munich Security Conference saw him doing the rounds of European leaders and holding meetings with U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. But world leaders may have to wait: with polls showing a real chance of a parliament with as many as seven parties, Germany could be in for many months of fractious coalition talks before Merz walks into Berlin's riverside chancellery.

Gold prices eased on Friday as investors booked profits from the previous session’s record high, but were set for an eighth straight weekly gain, driven by strong safe-haven demand amid concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff plans. Prices have shattered two record highs last week to trade above $2,950, as uncertainties surrounding global economic growth and political instability have underscored investor appetite for bullion. Trump’s fresh bout of tariff plans announced earlier this week includes duties on lumber and forest products, on top of previously announced plans to impose duties on imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. This is after the imposition of an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium. Despite all this we have witnessed a sharp fall in Dollar index hovering around 106 supporting prices on lower end. Focus this week will be on US GDP, Inflation, consumer confidence and durables goods orders data.

Recommendation: Buy; : TP: Rs. 4,300 ; Upside: 18% About Monarch Networth Capital Ltd. (MNCL) Since 2019, Monarch Networth has embarked on an extraordinary journey of transformation. The company has evolved from a traditional offline retail broking firm into a vibrant, fully integrated financial services powerhouse. Their strategic expansion into new realms such as Investment Banking, Alternative Investment Funds (AUM now at Rs 1000 cr.), Institutional Research, Debt Capital Markets, and Wealth Management has been nothing short of remarkable. The firm is present in 100+ cities with 55+ branches across the country and also has a sub-broker network of 900+. This year MNCL also announced a fundraise of 300 crore and issued a 1:1 bonus. The company profit soared from 2 crores in 2020 to 123 crores in 2024 with a profit of 40 crore alone in Q1 FY2025. “The market experienced tumultuous sessions, with initial attempts to rally ultimately faltering. The Trump administration’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs hit export-oriented industries hard, particularly the pharmaceutical sector, which saw significant underperformance. The auto sector also struggled, facing increased competition due to the opening up to foreign players. Adding to the market’s woes, the hawkish stance from the FOMC minutes cast a shadow over the likelihood of further rate cuts, complicating the economic outlook. However, the metal indices found some relief on Chinese steps to revive private investments. India is currently lagging behind its Asian peers, as FII outflows remain high, with the “sell India, buy China” strategy continuing to yield returns for the time being. Investors are keeping a close eye on upcoming pivotal indicators, such as the US Core PCE Price Index and India’s GDP growth rate. The market’s mood remains cautious, with pessimistic sentiments likely to linger until there is a marked improvement in corporate earnings and a conducive environment with easy global liquidity and stabilised currency.” Citi on Indigo: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 5200/Sh versus Rs 5100/Sh (Positive) Citi on Federal Bank: Maintain Buy on Bank, target price at Rs 242/Sh (Positive) Jefferies on M&M: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 4075/Sh (Positive) MS on Cyient: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 1750/Sh (Positive) Nomura on Auto: EV policy to accelerate adoption, Tesla’s entry to benefit suppliers like Sona Comstar, Sansera and Motherson Sumi (Positive) CLSA on IT sector: Demand drivers improving; GenAI to be revenue driver going forward.

Throughout the week, the benchmark index struggled to break free from a narrow range, reflecting a cautious sentiment. The lingering pressure from developments in the previous week significantly influenced market performance, resulting in a persistent stagnation as the index remained anchored near the lower boundary of the falling wedge pattern. As the week ended, the overall lack of enthusiasm culminated in a negative outcome, with the index sliding by 0.58 percent to settle a tad below the 22800 zone. The benchmark index has been under pressure over the past 13 trading sessions, with the exception of a brief respite at the beginning of the week. Unfortunately, that single day of positive movement did not lead to any lasting improvements or beneficial effects on the overall market trend. Since NIFTY has been hovering around the lower band of 22900 - 22700 for the last few days and has rejected all attempts to convincingly cross the 23000 mark, the key support of 22700 seems in jeopardy. As a result, we would see it entering a crucial support zone of 22700 - 22400, where the actual litmus test lies for our markets. This scenario would likely heighten volatility and amplify concerns among investors; but we would advise traders to not get carried away and should avoid staying aggressive short in the market. Let the market decide its next course of action during the monthly expiry week. The first obstacle is located at 23000-23150, corresponding to the 20-DEMA, followed closely by 23300-23350, which marks the upper band of the wedge pattern. It is only through a decisive breach of these resistances that some relief and upward movement may be restored for market participants, potentially providing a much-needed boost to investor confidence. In light of the shortened monthly expiry week and the prevailing global uncertainties, we can expect an uptick in market volatility. Given the current landscape, it is prudent for traders to refrain from making overly aggressive bets and to adopt a more cautious approach, maintaining lighter positions on both the bullish and bearish sides. Furthermore, the inherent vulnerabilities within the market highlight the critical importance of vigilance. Traders should proactively consider various risk management strategies to navigate the evolving conditions effectively, ensuring they are prepared for potential market shifts. “FII selling continues unabated in the Indian stock market. After selling stocks for Rs 81903 crores through the exchanges in January, FIIs followed it up by selling stocks for Rs 30588 crores in February through 21st. This takes the total selling in 2025, so far, to Rs 112492 crores (NSDL). This massive selling has resulted in the Nifty yielding negative returns of 4% YTD. After Trump’s victory in US presidential elections, the US market has been attracting huge capital inflows from the rest of the world. But recently, China has emerged as a major destination of portfolio flows. The Chinese president’s new initiatives with their leading businessmen have kindled hopes of a growth recovery in China. The Chinese stock market responded positively to this. The Hang Seng index (FIIs buy Chinese stocks through the Hong Kong stock market) shot up by 18.7% in a month in sharp contrast to the 1.55 % decline in the Nifty. Since Chinese stocks continue to be cheap, this ‘Sell India, Buy China’ trade may continue. But this trade has happened in the past and experience is that it will fizzle out soon since there are structural problems constraining Chinese economic revival. Revival of FII investment in India will happen when economic growth and corporate earnings revive. Indications of that are likely to happen in two to three months.” Bears will continue to tighten their grip on the Indian markets amid heavy FII selling on Monday. Gift Nifty at 22,690 indicates a gap-down opening of about 300 points. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, said: foreign investor sentiment also remained weak, with approximately $25 billion in FII outflows since the market peak in late September, driven by concerns over high valuations and a slowing economy. India’s GDP growth is projected to decelerate to a four-year low of 6.4 per cent in this fiscal year, raising apprehensions about corporate profitability and economic stability. Institutional activity reflected net FII outflows of ₹7,793 crore in the cash segment, while DII inflows stood at ₹16,582 crore, offering some support to the market.

The company has evolved from a traditional offline retail broking firm into a vibrant, fully integrated financial services powerhouse. Their strategic expansion into new realms such as Investment Banking, Alternative Investment Funds (AUM now at Rs 1000 cr.), Institutional Research, Debt Capital Markets, and Wealth Management has been nothing short of remarkable. The firm is present in 100+ cities with 55+ branches across the country and also has a sub-broker network of 900+. This year MNCL also announced a fundraise of 300 crore and issued a 1:1 bonus. The company profit soared from 2 crores in 2020 to 123 crores in 2024 with a profit of 40 crore alone in Q1 FY2025. “The market experienced tumultuous sessions, with initial attempts to rally ultimately faltering. The Trump administration’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs hit export-oriented industries hard, particularly the pharmaceutical sector, which saw significant underperformance. The auto sector also struggled, facing increased competition due to the opening up to foreign players. Adding to the market’s woes, the hawkish stance from the FOMC minutes cast a shadow over the likelihood of further rate cuts, complicating the economic outlook. However, the metal indices found some relief on Chinese steps to revive private investments. India is currently lagging behind its Asian peers, as FII outflows remain high, with the “sell India, buy China” strategy continuing to yield returns for the time being.

Throughout the week, the benchmark index struggled to break free from a narrow range, reflecting a cautious sentiment. The lingering pressure from developments in the previous week significantly influenced market performance, resulting in a persistent stagnation as the index remained anchored near the lower boundary of the falling wedge pattern. As the week ended, the overall lack of enthusiasm culminated in a negative outcome, with the index sliding by 0.58 percent to settle a tad below the 22800 zone. The benchmark index has been under pressure over the past 13 trading sessions, with the exception of a brief respite at the beginning of the week. Unfortunately, that single day of positive movement did not lead to any lasting improvements or beneficial effects on the overall market trend. Since NIFTY has been hovering around the lower band of 22900 - 22700 for the last few days and has rejected all attempts to convincingly cross the 23000 mark, the key support of 22700 seems in jeopardy. As a result, we would see it entering a crucial support zone of 22700 - 22400, where the actual litmus test lies for our markets. This scenario would likely heighten volatility and amplify concerns among investors; but we would advise traders to not get carried away and should avoid staying aggressive short in the market. Let the market decide its next course of action during the monthly expiry week. The first obstacle is located at 23000-23150, corresponding to the 20-DEMA, followed closely by 23300-23350, which marks the upper band of the wedge pattern. It is only through a decisive breach of these resistances that some relief and upward movement may be restored for market participants, potentially providing a much-needed boost to investor confidence. In light of the shortened monthly expiry week and the prevailing global uncertainties, we can expect an uptick in market volatility. Given the current landscape, it is prudent for traders to refrain from making overly aggressive bets and to adopt a more cautious approach, maintaining lighter positions on both the bullish and bearish sides. Furthermore, the inherent vulnerabilities within the market highlight the critical importance of vigilance. Traders should proactively consider various risk management strategies to navigate the evolving conditions effectively, ensuring they are prepared for potential market shifts. “FII selling continues unabated in the Indian stock market. After selling stocks for Rs 81903 crores through the exchanges in January, FIIs followed it up by selling stocks for Rs 30588 crores in February through 21st. This takes the total selling in 2025, so far, to Rs 112492 crores (NSDL). This massive selling has resulted in the Nifty yielding negative returns of 4% YTD. After Trump’s victory in US presidential elections, the US market has been attracting huge capital inflows from the rest of the world. But recently, China has emerged as a major destination of portfolio flows. The Chinese president’s new initiatives with their leading businessmen have kindled hopes of a growth recovery in China. The Chinese stock market responded positively to this. The Hang Seng index (FIIs buy Chinese stocks through the Hong Kong stock market) shot up by 18.7% in a month in sharp contrast to the 1.55 % decline in the Nifty. Since Chinese stocks continue to be cheap, this ‘Sell India, Buy China’ trade may continue. But this trade has happened in the past and experience is that it will fizzle out soon since there are structural problems constraining Chinese economic revival. Revival of FII investment in India will happen when economic growth and corporate earnings revive. Indications of that are likely to happen in two to three months.” Bears will continue to tighten their grip on the Indian markets amid heavy FII selling on Monday. Gift Nifty at 22,690 indicates a gap-down opening of about 300 points. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, said: foreign investor sentiment also remained weak, with approximately $25 billion in FII outflows since the market peak in late September, driven by concerns over high valuations and a slowing economy. India’s GDP growth is projected to decelerate to a four-year low of 6.4 per cent in this fiscal year, raising apprehensions about corporate profitability and economic stability. Institutional activity reflected net FII outflows of ₹7,793 crore in the cash segment, while DII inflows stood at ₹16,582 crore, offering some support to the market.

Title: Ambulances, helicopters and medical advice: Behind the scenes at one of Ireland's 999 call centres

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. CHANCES ARE THAT if you’ve dialled 999 or 112, it has been a worrying time in your life. But for over 230 staff at the National Ambulance Service, your call was just one of around 1,000 emergencies that are processed at their command and control centres every day. The National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), where calls are taken, is split across two sites: one is based in Tallaght in Dublin; and a smaller site is based in Ballyshannon in Co Donegal. In Tallaght, Martha Loorem can see the Dublin Mountains from her desk as she answers the phone to people in need from a centre that’s five storeys up. “It can be very varied; you know it pretty much covers everything,” she tells The Journal when asked to describe her work. “It can range from somebody with a cough or a cold [who doesn’t] know where to go for help or [who doesn't] have a GP, right up to… very tragic, very traumatic cases, and everything in between really.” Although no two emergencies are the same, Loorem says that there are some common features in the calls – and common types of caller – that they get. Every call-taker follows a script and inputs the caller’s answers about the situation they’re ringing about in order to determine the seriousness of the incident. Call-takers work 12-hour shifts, some during the day and some at night, but everyone alternates on a shift pattern. “I like the mix, so I wouldn’t want to do either full-time; I actually like switching between the two,” Loorem says. “I think it just suits me, I don’t really think I have a body clock any more. I suppose in terms of why I chose the job, I wanted to do something that I thought I would find rewarding. “There are calls where people are very, very sick, and they’re genuinely panicked, and they really don’t know what to do or where they’ve just seen something tragic; they need that reassurance on the other end of the phone as well, not only that the help is coming, but [that they can be told] what to do.” “When you have those calls where you know you made a difference, that is quite rewarding, and it is quite satisfying to bring somebody from being panicked to quite panicked, and then the ambulance gets there, and paramedics take over.” Martha Loorem, an Emergency call-taker with the National Ambulance Service Alex Rowley Alex Rowley As The Journal walks through the control room, it feels surprisingly calm given the number of people in it and the work they’re doing. However, Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin assures us that things can get hectic during peak hours. “Everybody is trained as an emergency call taker,” he explains. “Technically, everyone is classed as an emergency medical controller… Generally, the journey is call taking, and then some will decide they want to take on dispatch.” There are rows of desks on either side of the room, with supervisors in a back corner who oversee everything. Screens hang from the ceiling which show how many call-takers are active across both call centres in Dublin and Donegal, as well as how many calls are coming in and the number of response vehicles that are in active use at a given time. At a dispatcher’s desk, Amy Curtis sends crews in the southwest of the country out to calls. She joined the NEOC after completing a PLC in the Pre-Paramedic Fire and Ambulance course at Blackrock Further Education Institute. Curtis spent two years as a call-taker before moving into her new role as an Emergency Medical Dispatcher just over six months ago. In her job as a dispatcher, she collates all the information received by call-takers and assigns an appropriate response vehicle and crew to the emergency. Dispatchers have to take into account a myriad of factors, including the severity of an emergency, vehicle availability, and the safety of the scene. “Dispatching is a lot more fast-paced than call-taking,” Curtis says. “I would call dispatching like putting pieces to a puzzle; you’re trying to figure things out for each case. Every crew member is your responsibility from the start of the shift until the end. “You need to know where all your crew members are and who is going where, because sometimes when the radio is going, and you are on your own at the desk, there could be six or seven radio transmissions, and you need to know what each crew is doing to be able to prioritise which crew you answer first.” Trainee dispatchers are mentored by a senior member of staff for 13 shifts before becoming fully qualified. This may seem like a relatively short schooling; however, Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin points out that although it is a particularly difficult job, NEOC staff are constantly receiving further education through the HSE’s learning and development programmes. Advertisement “It is an extremely challenging environment for the dispatchers because [they are dealing with] multiple calls, and are getting a lot of information thrown at them from the radio and the people around the desk. “It’s about assimilating that information and putting it in a logical order in terms of its priority, and figuring out what each piece of information does to your next decision.” Larkin explains that there are various layers to learning how to dispatch, but that the ultimate outcome is patient care. All staff are licensed by the academy, and there is mandatory continuous learning associated with re-certification every two years. In yet another corner of the room, there is a set-up that looks like a mini situation room: it contains a whiteboard with codes, call signs, and maps with a row of desks in front. This is where the aero-medical dispatch desk is located, and the team that sit there are responsible for coordinating helicopter responses to medical emergencies. In Ireland, there are two helicopters available to the National Ambulance Service. The Air Corps operates one air ambulance from the Custume Barracks in Athlone, which is staffed by military pilots, an Air Corps Emergency Medical Technician, and an advanced paramedic from the NAS. In Cork, the ambulance service contracts another, smaller helicopter based in Rathcoole. In addition, the Coast Guard has four rescue helicopters based in Shannon, Dublin, Waterford, and Sligo, which are on hand to assist the ambulance service if required. The Coast Guard can organise medical evacuations for critically ill patients to other countries, such as England. It’s also responsible for pre-planning and dispatching the Critical Care Retrieval Service (CCRS) – like an intensive care unit on wheels, enabling critically ill patients to be transported to a major hospital alongside a team of specialist doctors, nurses, and pre-hospital practitioners. The National Emergency Operations Centre in Tallaght Alex Rowley Alex Rowley Daragh Lettice is one of the members of that team, and explains how he co-ordinates air ambulances to 999 incidents anywhere in Ireland, liaises with the Irish Coast Guard for search and rescue missions, and works with emergency teams for mountain rescues. “We also look after repatriations with a wider HSE group, the Treatment Abroad service, [looking after] any injured parties on holidays or whatever the case may be, technically, for anywhere in the world,” he says. “The flip side of that is that if we have a patient going out of the country, we would arrange all the logistics again. That may involve ambulance transport or an air ambulance with the Irish Air Corps, or from a list of private suppliers that are contracted to the HSE. The team also carries out vital work helping children who are on organ transplant lists, called the ‘Priority 1′ service. In those cases, the team’s job is to keep children’s details – their addresses, next of kin, and passports – on file and up to date. If a call comes in for transport, there is a four-hour window from the time of the call to get a child to the hospital, whether that’s in the UK or elsewhere. “Our goal is always to get advanced life support to the scene of an incident that may warrant helicopter transfer.” Lettice explains. “We see it as a completed mission if we deploy the advanced paramedic to the scene, regardless of whether the patient flies to the hospital or goes by road”. But what is the work like day-to-day? Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin puts considerable emphasis on the working environment of the control room and the overall culture within NEOC. The aim is to ensure that each staff member can operate at the highest level every day. The control room is full of people with experience working in clinical settings and in different parts of the HSE, with whom younger colleagues can liaise if they’re faced with a problem. There are also strong support structures in place for anyone who wishes to avail of them, should they feel overwhelmed by a particular emergency. “What we are really after here culturally is an environment where people can perform to their maximum ability but also an environment that encourages escalation and cooperation, so that nobody is sitting at their desks wondering, ‘What will I do here?’,” Larkin says. “We are very open about it: if you have an issue, put your hand up, and we will fix it together. “If that is on the aeromedical desk, dispatch desk, or call-taking desk, it doesn’t matter. “If we know about it, we can put the remediation in, and that is the culture that we absolutely promote.” Sometimes, those tasked with responding to 999 emergency calls need help too.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. India’s second-biggest information technology services company has begun work much in advance to expand its largest contract worth more than $3 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Bengaluru-headquartered Infosys Ltd wants an early extension of the eight-year contract signed in December 2020 with German automobile major Daimler, the people added, with a new revenue arm added that brings in artificial intelligence (AI) tools into the deal. The Daimler project, dubbed ‘twice as fast program’ inside Infosys, has the company offering solutions in six areas—network, security, SAP basis, data centre, workplace, and operations—and assures it of average annual revenue of $400 million, according to the two people cited earlier. The data centre business brings in $160 million revenue annually, while the remaining software and hardware components bring in the balance $240 million. Also read | Healthcare: Inside the larger duel behind the Infosys-Cognizant court battle Infosys is looking to renegotiate and bolster the hardware and software business part with a seventh revenue arm—that of AI—into a new deal with Daimler, and expand the business by at least a year, from 2028 to 2029, according to the two people cited earlier. “We are told there will be an added AI component as part of the new RFP (request for proposal)," said one of the executives. “The overall revenue Infosys gets from Daimler in a year is expected to increase."

Title: Who is Friedrich Merz? Meet the conservative leader taking the reins of the German chancellery

Friedrich Merz, a man who has never held a government role, is preparing to take the reins in Germany just as the country faces its biggest economic and diplomatic crises in decades and Europe looks urgently for a new generation of leaders for an era of transatlantic tension. Merz's conservatives came first in Germany's national election on Sunday, according to projected results, well ahead of their closest rival, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), giving him a mandate to form a coalition government. "Germany will once more be governed reliably," he told supporters on Sunday evening. The results spell an unlikely third-act triumph for the 69-year-old, who just seven years ago was seen as a failed politician fully reconciled to ending his career as a wealthy lobbyist and member of numerous company boards. A protégé of the late Wolfgang Schaeuble, finance minister and icon of German fiscal conservatism, Merz enjoyed a meteoric rise through his Christian Democrats, becoming the party's parliamentary leader in the 2000s. Tall and with a sonorous voice, the arch-conservative Merz was a perfect figure for the party in 1989 – when he first won elected office for the European Parliament. Hailing from the Sauerland, a Catholic upland region in far western Germany known for its social conservatism and close-knit village communities, he embodied many of the virtues of West Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall – transatlanticist, business-oriented and socially conservative. However, reunification in 1990 allowed Angela Merkel, the East German daughter of a protestant pastor, to enter politics and elbow both Schaeuble and Merz aside on her rise to become chancellor. The east continues to be Merz's weak spot. A Forsa poll on Friday showed that unlike his Social Democrat and Green rivals, this distinctly Rhineland figure is still far less trusted in the east than the west. It is also the east that gave rise to the greatest challenge to Merz's authority in the guise of the far-right AfD, which took first place in one eastern regional election last year and could yet greatly constrain his ability to govern after the elections. Never the favorite of his party's professional advisers, Merz was twice rejected as Merkel's successor as party leader, in 2018 and 2021, before his doggedness won out in 2022. He took office pledging to kill off the nativist AfD by breaking with Merkel's centrism and moving the party rightwards. The AfD, on 10% when he took office, won some 20% in Sunday's election, according to projected results. "I want to do politics so that a party like the AfD is no longer needed in Germany," he told a congress of his conservatives in January, blaming the Social Democrat Scholz and his Green partners for creating the conditions that nurtured the AfD. In January, responding to two high-profile killings in which immigrants were the main suspects, he manoeuvred to get a resolution demanding a clampdown on migration through parliament, knowing that it would only pass with AfD support. Critics, even in his own ranks, saw this as an unforgivable breach of a political quarantine designed to keep the AfD out of power. For some, it was a case of Merz's strategic sense not matching the acute tactical skills that enabled him to repeatedly pin down Scholz, first with a 2022 visit to Kyiv that exposed the chancellor's hesitancy on supporting Ukraine, and then by getting a court to strike down a budget, setting in motion the chain of events that collapsed Scholz's government. The migration vote created a lingering sense of distrust, and fueled concerns that he may struggle to persuade other parties to govern with him, a necessity in Germany's proportional electoral system. "I don't want to suggest Merz plans (a coalition with the AfD), but I have to say my personal confidence that he won't do it after the election if that's his only way of becoming Chancellor - that's gone," said Ulf Buermeyer, host of the popular and influential podcast State of the Nation. Some internal critics grudgingly sense his Atlanticism, excellent spoken English and negotiating skills honed in the boardrooms in which he served during his political hiatus make him a good candidate for the Trump era. An early and outspoken backer of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia, he has said he would under some circumstances send Kyiv the high-end Taurus missiles that Scholz has always blocked. On fiscal policy, his policies are equally ill-defined, but he has suggested he is open to reforming constitutionally-enshrined debt limits that doomed Scholz's government and have hampered attempts to boost military spending. For all that, he is in many ways an old-fashioned figure from the time before he left politics for a lucrative second career at Blackrock that made the hobby pilot wealthy enough to own an aeroplane. Parts of his policy agenda are reactive: he has pledged to scrap an unemployment benefit and easier citizenship rules introduced by Scholz's coalition, and to introduce tougher border controls. He once told an interviewer that he would leave politics if it ever placed his 40-year-marriage, to Charlotte, a judge, under strain. "For me that price would be too high," he said. If he takes office, he will be the first chancellor with children, and the first not previously divorced, since Helmut Kohl left office in 1998. He has been assiduous about building contacts with the European leaders who would be his peers, with some welcoming the prospect of an end to Scholz's divided and indecisive government. "Almost undiplomatic," was how one European diplomat described the enthusiasm with which Paris was awaiting Merz's arrival. Last weekend's Munich Security Conference saw him doing the rounds of European leaders and holding meetings with U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. But world leaders may have to wait: with polls showing a real chance of a parliament with as many as seven parties, Germany could be in for many months of fractious coalition talks before Merz walks into Berlin's riverside chancellery.

Title: Friedrich Merz: conservative set to be Germany's next chancellor

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden A long-time rival of centrist ex-chancellor Angela Merkel within the CDU party, Merz has attacked her open-door migrant policy and drawn her ire for accepting support from the far-right AfD on the flashpoint issue in parliament. At age 69, trained lawyer Merz boasts a strong business background -- including at investment fund BlackRock and on many corporate boards, which made him a millionaire -- but has never held a government leadership post. Nonetheless, the combative orator seeks to project a statesman-like persona and has voiced confidence he can deal with mercurial US President Donald Trump, whom he has labelled "predictably unpredictable". As the three-way coalition of centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz floundered, Merz as head of the opposition CDU/CSU block rained withering fire on the outgoing "green-left" government. Polls had long declared Merz -- despite lukewarm personal approval ratings -- the strong favourite to oust Scholz and bring an end to what Merz labels "three lost years" for Germany. In a recent blistering parliament speech, Merz likened Scholz and his allies to business managers who have bankrupted a company but still ask to extend their contracts by four years. "Do you know what the owners would say once they stopped laughing?" Merz asked mockingly. "They would politely ask you to leave the company. That's how it is in normal life." Merz's campaign promise was to revive the ailing economy and rebuild Berlin's international standing for "a Germany we can be proud of again". On Sunday a jubilant Merz -- eager to get going with his decades-old dream to run the country -- urged speedy talks to forge a new coalition government, warning that "the world out there is not waiting for us". 'Zero tolerance' Among his toughest pledges is to shut German borders to undocumented migrants, even if they seek asylum and to detain those awaiting deportation. Merz has in the past labelled the sons of Muslim immigrants "little pashas" and accused some Ukrainian war refugees of "social welfare tourism", before later apologising. Last month, Merz sparked high drama in parliament -- and waves of street protests -- when he pushed through a motion signalling his immigration crackdown with support from the extreme-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), breaking a long-standing taboo of never dealing with the controversial party. In other signals of a rightward shift, Merz has vowed a "zero tolerance" law-and-order drive, to reverse marijuana legalisation, limit "woke" policies and gender-sensitive language and study a return to nuclear power. READ ALSO: Tax to citizenship - What should foreigners in Germany expect from a CDU-led government? Merz argues all this will lure voters back from the AfD. But he may yet have to temper some of his policies as he seeks one or more coalition partners. Scholz during the campaign sought to portray his rival as a "hothead" and charged that his dalliance with the AfD signals he would one day rule with the far-right party -- a charge Merz strongly rejects. News magazine Der Spiegel has said Merz takes conflicts personally and is sometimes given to fits of anger, opining that "if Merz were a bullfighter, he would probably hold the red cloth in front of his stomach". Hobby pilot Merz, who is Roman Catholic, was born on November 11th, 1955, and lives among the rolling hills and forests of the Sauerland region of North Rhine-Westphalia state. At 198 centimetres (or six feet six inches) tall, Merz stands out in a crowd and is a licenced pilot who sometimes flies his own private jet. He has been married for more than 40 years to Charlotte Merz, a judge, with whom he has three adult children. He was elected to the European Parliament in 1989 and soon after to the Bundestag, where his mentor was the late CDU powerbroker Wolfgang Schaeuble. After chancellor Helmut Kohl's long reign ended in a slush fund scandal, Merkel soon sidelined Merz to take over the party and went on to run Germany for 16 years. For over a decade, Merz pursued a career in the private sector but never gave up his life-long ambition of becoming chancellor. A free-market liberal who wants to cut corporate taxes and slash red tape to help Germany Inc, he outlined his views in a 2008 book titled "Dare More Capitalism". Merz has sought to turn his long stint in the business world into a key selling point, said political scientist Antonios Souris of Berlin's Free University. "He likes to flirt a little with this role of having returned to politics as an outsider, as an experienced captain of industry, not just a career politician like Scholz." His CV and personal wealth have left Merz open to charges of being out of touch with voters -- an accusation he has rebuffed by insisting he belongs to the "upper middle class".

Title: Friedrich Merz on track to be Europe’s most powerful leader as America turns its back

After winning the German election, the conservative leader must navigate a new era without Washington as a close ally. This article is also available in: French BERLIN — Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany’s most American chancellor. Never in history has a German head of government had more affinity for the United States. Merz has traveled to the U.S. over 100 times, by his own tally, and counts former U.S. President Ronald Reagan as one of his role models. Merz, whose conservative alliance looks to have won Sunday’s national election with 29 percent of the vote, according to early official projections, is particularly fond of one Reagan quip that summarizes the German leader’s American-style skepticism of state intervention: “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’” But just as Merz is on the cusp of taking power in Germany, his cherished America has turned from indispensable friend to frenemy. Merz and other European mainstream leaders increasingly see the U.S. no longer a beacon — that “shining city upon a hill,” as Reagan liked to call it — but rather as another force joining Russia and China to steadily chip away at their ever-more brittle democracies. “This is really now the change of an era,” Merz said on stage at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month after U.S. Vice President JD Vance gave a speech that cast Europe’s centrist parties — not Russia or China — as the greatest threat to European security. “If we don’t hear the wake-up call now,” Merz added, “it might be too late for the entire European Union.” Vance’s appearance in Munich is likely to go down in European history as an epochal shift just as significant as Vladimir Putin’s 2007 speech at the same conference, when the Russian president effectively declared war on the U.S.-led liberal order. Now, it’s the U.S. administration itself that is turning its back on that consensus. German leaders, including Merz, have been especially slow to accept the new reality, declaring until recently that the transatlantic alliance will endure despite clear signals from the Trump administration that it will halt military aid for Ukraine, question the U.S. commitment to defend Europe, and bolster far-right, Kremlin-friendly forces. For Merz, an avowed transatlanticist, there could hardly be a ruder awakening. The question that will define his tenure will be whether he can lead Germany and Europe in defending the fraying liberal order without the U.S. — or whether, as Merz suggested in Munich, it’s already almost too late. This wasn’t how Merz had imagined his long-sought moment of victory. Born a decade after the end of World War II in Sauerland, a rural, mountainous region of West Germany, Merz was, by his own account, a less-than-spectacular student and an early smoker and drinker prone to disciplinary problems. Despite that rebellious streak, he was influenced by the deeply embedded conservative culture of the area and joined the center-right Christian Democratic Union while still in high school. After serving a brief stint in the military, Merz went to university in Bonn, then the capital of West Germany, where he studied law. Merz became a conservative member of the European Parliament in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. Five years later he was elected to the German Bundestag, where he developed a close relationship with Wolfgang Schäuble, the CDU stalwart and forceful advocate of European Union integration. Under Schäuble’s tutelage, Merz rose in stature and was considered a likely choice for chancellor candidate. His rise ended in 2002, however, when he lost a power struggle with the more centrist Angela Merkel. Note: Without rounding, BSW’s result stands at 4.972 percent; Source: ARD Seeing no role for himself in the CDU under Merkel, Merz withdrew to the back benches, and in the midst of the world financial crisis of 2008 published a paean to free markets titled “Dare for More Capitalism.” A year later he left the Bundestag to work as a corporate lawyer while also taking the helm of Atlantik-Brücke, a lobby advocating transatlantic ties. While with Atlantik-Brücke, Merz pushed for an EU-U.S. trade agreement — the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP — and forged closer connections with the U.S., networking with American politicians and corporate leaders. One of his favorite places in the U.S., he told biographer Volker Resing, is the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, where the former president is buried. Over a decade in the private sector, Merz sat on a series of corporate boards, including a four-year stint with U.S. asset manager BlackRock, a time he counts as among the happiest in his life, according to biographer Resing. Merz says this time provided him valuable experience outside of politics, but his critics accuse him of simply using his political connections to lobby for powerful interests, making himself a millionaire in the process. When Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018, Merz saw an opportunity to return to politics. Merkel’s centrism and generous refugee policies, Merz believed, had opened up the CDU’s right flank and allowed the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Merz set out to undo much of Merkel’s legacy and aimed to pull the CDU sharply to the right. The party, looking for reinvention after 16 years of Merkel and an election loss to Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 2021, elected him chairman in early 2022 on his third attempt for the job. “I am deeply moved,” Merz said after the vote, fighting back tears. Though Merz and his conservatives emerged victorious in Sunday’s election, surveys suggest he’s not particularly popular among the public. In a country that remains deeply skeptical of the financial industry, Merz’s wealth and time at BlackRock, the American investment company, are often viewed with suspicion. It doesn’t help matters that Merz routinely jets around the country in his own twin-engine plane, which he flies himself, having fulfilled a lifelong dream by getting his pilot’s license in his 50s. “Friedrich Merz is not really very beloved, but he is respected,” Günther Oettinger, a former senior CDU politician and European commissioner, told POLITICO late last year. Yet Merz also has a reputation for being impulsive, thin-skinned and prone to populist bluster, particularly when it comes to migration. His defenders say he’s merely a risk-taker — at trait he took from his years in the private sector — and someone who doesn’t shy away from sharp-tongued debate. Merz took one of his biggest gambles shortly before the election. After a series of high-profile attacks blamed on asylum-seekers in the months before the vote, Merz saw his conservatives steadily decline in the polls while the AfD rose. In January, after a knife-wielding Afghan man attacked a group of preschool children in a park in Bavaria, killing one child and a man who tried to protect the children, Merz decided it was time for a drastic shift. In a taboo-breaking move that weakened Germany’s postwar “firewall” around the far right, he and his conservatives aligned with the AfD in an attempt to get tough immigration measures through parliament — including a proposal to reject asylum-seekers at the border. In response to Merz’s acceptance of AfD support, tens of thousands of outraged demonstrators turned out in cities across the country. “Merz can no longer be trusted,” said Scholz, whose center-left SPD came third in Sunday’s election. Robert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the Greens, called Merz’s move “a disqualification” for the office of chancellor. But voters, who were broadly supportive of his tough migration policies, ultimately disagreed, lifting Merz to power. German conservatives have long hoped that Merz’s tough border policies, business background and familiarity with the U.S. will endear him to Donald Trump. “Merz is one of the Germans who is best connected in the U.S.” said Thomas Silberhorn, a conservative lawmaker specializing in transatlantic ties. “In this respect, I am very confident. He also knows the way things work. He is used to the mindset that you have to speak plainly.” Merz has also vowed to make “deals” with Trump. In an interview last month he suggested Germany could endear itself to Trump by buying American F-35 fighter jets and boosting defense spending to put Germany consistently above the NATO spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product. Despite the U.S. president’s love of tariffs, Merz also floated trying to bring back negotiations on TTIP, which collapsed during the first Trump administration. Until recently, however, Merz’s approach for confronting the Trump administration consisted mainly of denying the enormity of the challenge. Just a day before Vance’s speech at the MSC, Atlantik-Brücke, the transatlantic lobby group Merz formerly headed, published one of his essays on the transatlantic relationship. “Our alliance with America has been, is and will remain of paramount importance for security, freedom and prosperity in Europe,” Merz wrote. With Trump, he went on, “transatlantic relations will change again and yet we will continue to share common values, interests and a common promise of protection within NATO.” A few days later, Merz’s tone changed drastically as he warned of a transatlantic rupture. “The differences between the U.S. and Europe are taking on a whole new quality,” he wrote in a note to his supporters after Vance’s speech. “Now it is no longer ‘just’ about defense; now it is about our basic understanding of democracy and an open society.” Merz compared the moment to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when, as he put it, “we woke up from our dreams and had to learn to understand that our world is no longer what it was supposed to be.” German and European leaders were even more alarmed when Trump, a few days later, blamed Ukraine — not the Kremlin — for starting the war and then called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator.” Following Trump’s statements, Merz warned supporters at a rally in the state of Hesse that the “autocratic behavior at the top of the state” in the U.S. could persist for a long time. “Our response can only be that we must finally become resilient, capable of defense, and able to stand on our own feet in Europe,” he added. In an interview the following day, Merz warned that Europe should prepare for Trump to end NATO protection and hinted at a major strategic shift, saying Germany needed to discuss the possibility of “nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security” with European nuclear powers the United Kingdom and France. German conservatives have previously favored maintaining strong ties with the U.S. over calls from Paris to cultivate European “strategic autonomy.” Merz’s rhetorical shift showed just how unnerved he now is by the Trump administration. The question is whether Germany’s next chancellor will succeed in taking the EU — itself confronting the rise of Russia-friendly, far-right parties — in a fundamentally new direction. Merz has expressed a willingness to chart a new course, but the way forward remains murky. “Within this Europe, Germany must play a leading role,” Merz said at the rally in Hesse. “We must take on this responsibility. I, for one, am determined to do so.” Nette Nöstlinger and Rasmus Buchsteiner contributed to this report. Conservative leader’s gambit to weaken the postwar ‘firewall’ may be a boon for the AfD ahead of a national election. The AfD is using Elon Musk’s endorsement to reach out to Donald Trump — and to appear more acceptable at home ahead of a national election. The “chameleon” tech billionaire is one of the most powerful politically connected people in the world. Europe’s governments are still working out how to deal with being on his bad side. Dissolving of parliament sets the stage for what could be Germany’s sharpest swerve to the right in decades.

Successful nuclear energy companies have proven business models, substantial liquidity and recurring ... [+] cash flow to support capacity expansion and innovation. Investors are excited about the nuclear energy outlook. Energy demand is on the rise, partly due to the rapid buildout of AI data centers. These technology campuses can use as much electricity as small cities. Nuclear energy is an appealing option for serving increased power demand because it has low carbon emissions and cost advantages relative to wind and solar power. If you expect nuclear energy companies to capitalize on the growing need for cheap, clean energy, then read on. The five best nuclear energy stocks introduced below may be worth a look for your portfolio. These nuclear energy stocks were selected by screening on the following criteria: The table below includes five U.S.-listed nuclear energy stocks that meet the above criteria, plus the market capitalization and business focus for each. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025 and best growth stocks. Vistra generates power and provides electricity to households and businesses around the country. The company operates natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar assets and battery energy storage facilities. With a total capacity of about 41,000 megawatts, Vistra is one of the largest power producers in the U.S. Vistra has been increasing and protecting its nuclear capacity by acquiring the minority interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary and extending licenses at two owned nuclear facilities. The company created Vistra Vision with an 85% ownership position after purchasing nuclear and retail assets from Energy Harbor in 2023. Vistra has great liquidity and an active share repurchase program. The third quarter 2024 balance sheet included $905 million of cash and equivalents plus nearly $2.5 billion in availability on a revolving credit facility. Share repurchases over the last three years have totaled $4.58 billion. The company has reduced its share count by 30% in that time, achieving a buyback yield over 7%. Vistra also pays a small dividend yield of 0.52%. GE Vernova is a clean energy spin-off from General Electric (GE). The company generates, transfers, converts and stores electricity in the U.S. and globally. GEV's power portfolio includes products and services for gas, nuclear, hydro and steam power generation. Since spinning off from GE in 2023, GEV has turned a profit and more than tripled its free cash flow. The company has also published a promising five-year outlook. GEV’s 2028 guidance includes $45 billion in revenue and $14 billion in free cash flow. This represents substantial growth from the 2024 results of $1.4 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion in free cash flow. Capacity expansions and rising EBITDA margins across the power, electrification and wind businesses will be key profit drivers. Nuclear will play a role in GEV's growth. The company's alliance GE Hitachi produces the BWRX-300 small modular reactor, which offers scale and size advantages. Specifically, the reactor can be constructed in 36 months and requires a much smaller plant footprint than other options. The BWRX-300 will be deployable globally as early as 2029. Talen Energy sells electricity produced by its nuclear, fossil, solar and coal power plants. The company's power generation capacity is approximately 10.7 gigawatts, including 2.2 gigawatts of nuclear power. Talen Energy has a relationship with Amazon’s cloud computing division AWS. The power company sold a nuclear-powered data center campus to AWS in 2023. Talen also signed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with AWS. In November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) blocked the PPA due to transparency issues. Talen has subsequently filed a lawsuit against the ruling. Despite the FERC disagreement, the investment community is excited about Talen’s ability to supply carbon-free power to data centers. Analysts expect a revenue dip for Talen in 2025, followed by four years of double-digit growth. The average revenue growth expectation in 2026 is nearly 93%. The company also has a strong share repurchase program and good liquidity. The share repurchase target is 70% of adjusted free cash flow. At September 30, 2024, Talen had $648 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. BWX Technologies supplies nuclear components and services, primarily to the U.S. government. The offering includes naval nuclear reactors, commercial nuclear components and nuclear facility management. BWXT recently announced it would acquire Kinetrics, a leading nuclear services company. The acquisition, to close mid-2025, should add $300 million to BWX’s commercial segment. This complements the company's government business, which recently secured $2.1 billion in new naval nuclear contracts. Strength in the company’s government business drove 14% revenue growth and 15% GAAP EPS growth in the third quarter 2024. The company raised its full-year 2024 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the strong performance through the third quarter. The consensus price target for BWXT is $127.50, 18.4% higher than the stock’s current value. Centrus Energy provides uranium enrichment and nuclear reactor engineering services. Nuclear reactors require enriched uranium fuel, which has a higher concentration of the uranium-235 isotope. LEU is the only U.S.-owned, U.S.-technology uranium enrichment company. Centrus’s leadership team believes this is an advantage in winning U.S. federal contracts. The future opportunity in federal work could be substantial. There is currently $3.4 billion in federal funding already approved by Congress. However, $700 million of that is appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which President Trump paused by an executive order in January. Centrus already has multiple contracts with the Department of Energy, including one with a recently expanded Phase 2 contract value of $129 million. The company has sales momentum, too. 2024 revenue grew 38% to $442 million. However, higher cost of sales led to a profit decline in the period. Centrus does have a $3.7 billion backlog that extends to 2040. Bottom Line Nuclear companies are uniquely positioned to provide cost-effective, low-carbon energy to power the future. The ones that will rise to the top—whether they're power generators, reactor and component makers or service providers—will have proven business models, substantial liquidity and recurring cash flow to support capacity expansion and innovation.

Title: Vitalik Buterin Reveals the Most Disappointing Moment for Ethereum

Time Published: 2025-02-23T15:58:02Z
Full Content:
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has voiced concerns over criticisms directed at Ethereum’s stance on blockchain-based gaming applications. During a Wednesday AMA session on the chat app Tako, Buterin addressed user Mable Jiang’s inquiry about moments in the past year that left him frustrated or disappointed with the Ethereum Foundation, its community, or the industry. Jiang also asked if he had ever considered taking a break. In response, Buterin expressed his disappointment, particularly over criticisms that Ethereum is “bad and intolerant” for not embracing blockchain-based casinos as openly as other networks. “Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me recently was when someone said that Ethereum is bad and intolerant because we don’t respect the ‘casinos’ on the blockchain enough, and other chains are happy to accept any application, so they are better.” He stated. Despite occasional online rants about the network, Buterin, however, noted he finds comfort in personal interactions with the Ethereum community, most of whom remain committed to the platform’s original values. “I have a responsibility to this community and cannot abandon them. We Ethereum need to work together to create the world we want to see,” he added. Buterin also suggested potential strategic shifts to enhance the network, emphasizing the need for structural improvements for the network and greater decentralization within the Ethereum Foundation. He noted that the foundation, which currently facing a backlash for lack of neutrality, might need to be less neutral at the application layer and take a more active role in supporting certain initiatives. “This will require some changes,” he stated, adding, “But this project is worth doing.” Notably, Buterin’s response comes amid an ongoing debate in the blockchain space about balancing ethical considerations with open access. Some networks, like Solana, have taken a more permissive approach, welcoming applications across various sectors, including gambling and speculative ventures. However, this openness has also led to high-profile failures, such as the collapse of LIBRA, a meme coin on the Solana network. Recently, LIBRA collapsed, wiping out $4.5 billion in investor funds and causing a 15% drop in Solana’s value. Ethereum, in contrast, has long positioned itself as a network focused on decentralization, innovation, and long-term sustainability. These qualities have attracted institutional interest, with entities like BlackRock launching tokenized investment funds on the Ethereum network. Meanwhile, beyond his frustrations, Buterin remains actively engaged in Ethereum’s evolution, particularly its scalability through Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In January, he reaffirmed Ethereum’s commitment to scaling via L2s, identifying key challenges such as insufficient space for BLOB objects and L2 heterogeneity. He detailed upcoming upgrades, such as the Pectra update, which aims to enhance Ethereum’s transaction throughput with long-term goals, including achieving 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). He also underscored the importance of Ethereum’s economic model, advocating for ETH to serve as a “triple point asset,” functioning as a means of exchange, a consumable product, and a store of value. To strengthen Ethereum’s economic position, he proposed incentivizing L2 projects, optimizing rollup revenue structures, and adjusting BLOB pricing strategies.

Title: ROSEN, A RESPECTED AND LEADING FIRM, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – NVO

Time Published: 2025-02-23T15:09:00Z
Full Content:
February 23, 2025 10:09 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Ecwid should be on your radar if you want to sell digital or physical goods online, particularly if you're a newcomer to the e-commerce space. The platform differentiates itself from the competition via several notable features, including excellent website design tools, rich tutorials that quickly get you started making money online, and the ability to embed your store on third-party websites like Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping. However, two caveats prevent it from climbing into the category's upper echelon: an extremely limited free tier and a lack of 24/7 customer support across its four plans. For more feature robust services that have 24/7 customer support, check out our Editors' Choice winners for e-commerce platforms, Shopify and Wix Stores. Ecwid has four tiers: Free, Venture, Business, and Unlimited. Ecwid is one of the few e-commerce platforms with a free option, but the plan is quite limited. It restricts you to just five store items and email-based customer support. By comparison, Square Online offers a strong free tier that supports unlimited items and phone-based help (Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT). On the upside, you can advertise your Ecwid-powered site through Google, Meta, and Pinterest (TikTok advertising is locked behind the paid tiers), and get a free domain. The Venture plan ($25 per month or $21 per month with an annual plan) lets you store up to 100 total products in your online store, leverage live chat support when you have a question, sell on Facebook and Instagram, track inventory, and access Ecwid's mobile companion apps. The Business package ($45 per month or $39 per month with an annual plan) builds upon Venture with a 2,500-product inventory, the ability to sell via various online marketplaces (like Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping), abandoned cart emails, wholesale pricing, and phone support. The Unlimited hosting level ($105 per month or $89 per month with an annual plan) removes the inventory cap, which is great for businesses with large product catalogs. In addition, you can integrate your Ecwid account with POS systems (like Alice, Clover, and Square) and enjoy priority customer support. Ecwid has zero transaction fees. However, the paid plans lack free trials. On the other hand, the Editors' Choice-winning Shopify (starting at $29 per month) offers unlimited products and 24/7 customer service across the board. You should check out that top pick, depending on your budget and the number of items you'd like to sell. Ecwid's sign-up process is extremely fast and easy; you just create credentials and name your shop. If you're new to Ecwid or e-commerce, the dashboard sets you up for success with a six-step tutorial on launching a shop and a 10-minute video that walks you through critical features. In the catalog tab, you add products, create product categories, and whip up gift cards (gift cards are limited to paid plans). Adding products is simple: You drag and drop product images directly into the window and optionally upload a product video. You feel the Free tier's limitations here, as inventory tracking and the ability to set stock numbers are locked behind the paid tiers. For example, if you only have five band shirts in stock, you cannot highlight to customers how many are available before they sell out. Likewise, uploading a product video is locked to the Business and Unlimited tiers. The Ecwid dashboard lets you create your shop's skeleton before entering the full editor. There, you'll find editing options for image and video sizes, image aspect ratios, data displayed on your product cards, and how you want your customers to navigate your store. In a nice touch, Ecwid lets you preview the changes as you implement them. Then, you choose a template from 73 premade ones. That's low compared with Wix Stores, which has nearly 1,000. Once a template is selected, you make changes using the full editor. The customization options are plentiful and, most importantly, intuitive. They let you update the site copy, swap images, and choose how products are displayed. Another welcome feature is the ability to switch templates even after going live. This isn't commonplace. For example, Wix Stores requires you to rebuild the site to switch to a new template. Although slightly bifurcated design tools risk confusion, Ecwid makes it seamless and easy to understand. It puts the right tools in the right sections and gives you many useful tutorials on tailoring your store. Afterpay, AmazonPay, Clover, PayPal, and Square are just five of the 61 payment gateways compatible with Ecwid. There's even a crypto.com option if that's your thing. If you use a supported payment gateway, follow the setup instructions to create an account and link your bank account. The knowledge base articles offer assistance when it comes time to get started with payments. Ecwid partners with Square and the physical Square Reader for in-person sales. Square is one of the most common and reliable physical POS systems on the market, so it's good that your Ecwid account syncs with the company's hardware. Shopify also handles both in-person and online transactions. You can accept bank transfers, cash on delivery, phone orders (which Volusion also supports), and check and money orders. Ecwid has a companion app for Android and iOS. The useful dashboard elements (ease of use, simple navigation) also apply to its mobile offering. The apps display your reports, lets you add products, and create barcodes for those products with your phone's camera. The ability to create barcodes is a unique feature and one we hope more e-commerce services integrate in the future. With the Ecwid apps, your shop is truly in the palm of your hand. In addition to adding products, you can manage orders, create discounts, set up payments, and manage the settings on your various sales channels (like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok). Free-tier subscribers can test the app with a 28-day trial. Paid users have app access included with their subscriptions. Ecwid offers phone and chat-based customer support—if you're using the Business or Unlimited plan. The Free tier lacks live support (you must visit the aforementioned user forums and help pages), while the Venture tier supports web chat but not phone help. We're not fans of this tiered-based assistance. In addition, you can only receive a call back after you place a request via chat. In short, Ecwid's customer service is needlessly limited. On the upside, phone support is available 24 hours per day (Monday to Friday). Starting a business online can be stressful, and e-entrepreneurs want to hit the ground running with as few bumps as possible. On that note, Ecwid surprised us with its sleek interface, robust tutorials, and easy-to-use website editor. That said, the Free plan is far too limited, and the tiered customer support is a notable drawback of an otherwise positive experience.

Title: Open-Access Networks Explained: A New Way to Get Internet

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. How we test ISPs Open-access networks bring fast fiber to cities across the US, but they don’t operate like typical internet service providers. It's not Santa and his sleigh, but trucks like these bring a present of another kind: the gift of fiber connectivity. Colorful painted symbols decorate the streets a few blocks from my Albuquerque, New Mexico, home. Bright arrows and checks mark hidden water and gas lines. Large trucks with boring machines and vast spools of orange pipe are parked along the sidewalks. They’re here to install fiber for Gigapower, an open-access network. When Gigapower arrives at my house, it won’t be my internet service provider. Gigapower represents a different fiber model. Here’s what home internet customers need to know about open-access networks. Chances are, your home is covered by one or more internet providers, each with its own infrastructure -- whether cable, fiber, DSL or 5G, like my T-Mobile Home Internet. Open-access networks flip this concept on its head. Locating local internet providers An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. They use the same infrastructure but may have different prices, services and bundles. Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about open-access networks before. “Open access is not mainstream,” says Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “It’s kind of an edge case in the US.” Locating local internet providers Bolton says the concept is more widespread in countries where regulations and government involvement mean open access is common. You’re about to hear more about open-access networks thanks to Gigapower’s ambitious plans to expand fiber into previously overlooked communities. “From an operator's perspective, it's a no-brainer because someone else bears the cost of building out the network,” says Bolton. You’ll find two types of open-access networks in the US. Municipally-owned networks are owned by cities. Private companies own commercial networks. They both work in a similar fashion, usually with multiple ISPs competing for customers. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (Utopia Fiber) is a community-owned fiber network covering homes in 21 Utah cities, including Brigham City, Orem, Payson and Woodland Hills. The Utopia communities weren’t satisfied with existing home internet options. They wanted fast fiber. “If the incumbent operators aren't willing to make the investment, then the community takes it in their hands because they need it for economic development,” says Bolton. Gigapower is an example of a commercial open-access network. The company is a joint venture between telecommunications giant AT&T and investment company BlackRock. In Albuquerque, AT&T Fiber is signed on as an anchor tenant, but that still leaves room for other ISPs to potentially jump on board and compete to offer fiber internet to customers. When ISPs share the same network, they want to stand out from the crowd. That can translate into a complex dance of promotions, pricing and streaming or phone bundle options. Gigapower’s rollout is still young, so we have yet to see how this might play out in the longer term, but we can look to Utopia for clues. With the Utopia model, consumers cover two fees. One is the monthly price paid to the ISP and the other is the fiber connection cost for Utopia, which typically runs $30 monthly. Put the two together to get your total. For example, you could sign up for XMission’s 1Gbps plan for $54. Adding in the Utopia fee brings your monthly total to around $85. Bolton says that’s pretty typical for gigabit pricing on an open-access network. “You start seeing there's a lot of bundling going on,” Bolton says. “Providers typically try to find other things of value that they can add to sweeten the deal.” If you’re shopping among ISPs on an open-access network, look at promotions, bundles, add-ons and the provider’s customer service reputation. Scan the Utopia providers’ pricing and you won’t see huge swings at the 250Mbps, gigabit or 2.5Gbps plan levels. But there is one area where pricing varies widely. Not all ISPs offer 10Gbps plans, but those that do have prices ranging from $110 to $200 per month. That won’t likely affect very many customers. Here’s how to figure out how much internet speed you really need. Utopia and Gigapower are two big names in open-access networks, but others exist. Colorado Springs Utilities, for example, is building out with Ting Internet as its initial anchor tenant. Other communities scattered around the country -- including Ammon, Idaho and Ashland, Oregon -- have open-access networks as well. On the commercial side, Ubiquity is expanding with a focus on Arizona, California, Nebraska and Texas. SiFi Networks specializes in citywide open-access fiber with networks under construction in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and New York. Cities that feel passed over for fast fiber broadband will continue to consider open-access networks. Meanwhile, Gigapower’s rapid expansion could bring more commercial companies into the fold. “I think it’s a great model and I wouldn’t be surprised if other people took advantage of it,” says Bolton. While gigabit speeds are common across fiber networks, most can offer faster services to homes. Utopia, for example, goes up to 10Gbps with some ISPs. AT&T Fiber typically offers up to 5Gbps. The open-access networks going in across the country can be scaled up to handle the internet demands of the future. “This is the final network for at least the next couple of generations,” says Bolton. There’s a hunger for fiber. Albuquerque has been a cable and DSL town for too long. Gigapower isn’t the only fiber player in the city. Ezee Fiber, Vexus Fiber and Quantum Fiber are all staking out parts of town with traditional networks, but Gigapower is coming in hot. I’ll notice Gigapower when it shows up on my street to install the bright orange tubes to run fiber. After that, I likely won’t give it much thought. I’ll be dealing with AT&T Fiber as my ISP, and, perhaps someday, I’ll be comparing AT&T with a competitor using the same network. Ultimately, what’s most important to me as a customer isn’t how the fiber gets here, just that it gets here. If that means ISPs competing on pricing and bundles down the line, then all the better. An open-access network is installed and operated by a company that leases access to ISPs. That means multiple providers can offer plans to customers using the same fiber network. An open-access network is one way a community overlooked for fiber can access fast, symmetrical broadband services. If private companies aren’t willing to invest, cities can use a municipal model instead. On the commercial side, open access networks remove the burden of installation and operation from ISPs, which can then piggyback on the network to reach customers. Plus, customers may benefit from competition among ISPs looking to differentiate themselves through pricing, customer service, perks or bundles. Competition among ISPs on an open-access network can benefit consumers, but don’t expect cut-rate price wars. There may be slight contrasts in pricing but more significant differences in phone and video bundles or free add-ons like streaming services. Also, look for promotional deals, like one or two months of free service for new customers.

The news from the New York Times is explosive: “U.S. Opposes Calling Russia Aggressor in G7 Declaration on Invasion”. U.S. opposition to a draft Group of 7 statement on the third anniversary of the Russian attack on Ukraine comes after President Trump blamed Kyiv for starting the war. Trump’s shift towards Putin’s Russia reverses generations of US policy. At the opening of the peace talks in Saudi Arabia, President Trump made it clear that Russia’s days of isolation are over and suggested that Ukraine is to blame for its invasion. Zelensky and Trump exchanged blows as the feud over the peace talks escalated. President Trump called Volodymyr Zelensky an ‘unelected dictator’ after the Ukrainian President said Trump was ‘in a web of disinformation’. “Europe,” writes the Wall Street Journal, “is looking for a response after Trump blamed Kyiv for the war in Ukraine. Stunned by the US rapprochement with Russia over Ukraine, European leaders are trying to find common ground.” . . . Screenshot from WSJ . Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni “reaffirmed Italy’s support for Ukraine”, but prudently did not go to Kyiv to the commemoration of the third anniversary of the war. Vice-President Matteo Salvini is explicitly siding with Trump, wishing that “he will absolutely go ahead”. The parliamentary left-wing declares through Fratoianni “nothing in common with Trump on Ukraine.” However, it is announced that in Kyiv “the EU will reaffirm Zelensky’s legitimacy as president of Ukraine.” Who Zelensky is and what his role is, we documented in Grandangolo of 11 August 2023. We, therefore, report the essential part of it: Scott Ritter’s investigative documentary showing the offshore companies set up by Zelensky and his associates in tax havens, through which “his puppeteers provided him with a financial cushion” with a first payment of 41 million dollars. The film shows the luxurious villas that Zelensky owns in Miami (this one alone is worth $34 million), in Israel, in Forte dei Marmi (Italy), in London, in Georgia, in Greece, and even in Crimea (the only bad investment, because Zelensky no longer owns it). Scott Ritter’s investigation also shows how Ukraine is being robbed of its most fertile land, sold off by Zelensky and Co. to multinational corporations. Still, it is also becoming increasingly indebted as the huge military supplies he receives from the US and the major European powers are not given away, but given on credit. This debt will increase with the ‘reconstruction‘ that Zelensky has put in the hands of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment company. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Heavenly Homemakers Encouraging women in homemaking, healthy eating and parenting February 23, 2025 by Laura 2 Comments Here’s our Big Family Food and Fun: February 16-22, 2025 post! Before launching into the week’s food and fun, I’ll share the tail end of last week’s fun. We were home relaxing for Sabbath that evening, enjoying fun treats and family time. Dinner that night was Fish Sandwiches – or just Fish Sticks for those who didn’t want a bun. We went through an entire Costco-sized bag of sticks, reminding me that almost everyone in our household likes these and it makes an easy meal that is different from our norm. Mental note: add fish sticks to the upcoming Costco list… Our Sabbath dinner also featured special sparkling water and the kids’ choice of a dessert. We practiced memorizing scripture while we ate and talked through what these verses mean in our lives. Sunday morning, we ate what has become our traditional, effortless Sabbath Sunday morning breakfast: Breakfast Cookie Bars that I’d made ahead and frozen. We had a lovely group join us at lunchtime, with 25 of us around the table that day. We had asked one of the families to please pick up Rotisserie Chicken from Sam’s on their way here, which they were happy to do (plus they brought their traditional Doritos that the kids all love). So our meal that day was three Rotisserie Chickens with Homemade Bread and Butter, Green Beans, Potato Salad, and Oatmeal Butterscotch Cookies. It was all so simple and so good, and a wonderful time of fellowship. Ms. Megan had brought a Color Wonder kit so many of the kids joined her around the living room table before and after lunch to color. :) Later that afternoon, we loaded our family up for a Kid Event at the Mall. Our friend Caitlyn had been at our house for lunch and joined us on our outing. Malachi hopped in too, plus our friend/housemate, Kermit. It was great to have so many adult helpers! The kids got free books, water bottles, games, and bubbles. They got to golf and play instruments. We had decided to make the most of this outing since we had braved the cold to get to the mall. So when the event ended, we headed over to the play area (as did many of the other families with kids at the event – so it was packed!). Malachi needed some new business-casual clothes for his work, so while the kids played, some of us went next door into H&M to shop. We scored some great deals from their clearance racks! And Anna made a new friend… I had packed us a picnic dinner – something we haven’t been able to do all winter long. But this was a great opportunity to enjoy a winter picnic, so we headed to the food court tables and had Peanut Butter Jelly Sandwiches, Salami, Cheese Sticks, Apples, Applesauce, and Carrots. As we were finishing up our meal, Matt bought an order of fries for everyone to have a small surprise treat before we headed home. There was no school on Monday or Tuesday of this week (pre-scheduled days off). It snowed all morning and part of the afternoon so we just hung out in the house, trying to keep kids busy. Brayden and Keith became occupied with Legos for two entire hours, creating the beginnings of a Lego City! Breakfast and Lunch that day was an assortment of leftovers as we finished up tidbits of Breakfast Cookie Bars, Chili, and Noodles throughout the morning/afternoon. I made a pot of broth that morning with the leftover chicken bones from the three Rotisserie Chickens the day before. For dinner that night, I used the broth to make Simple Chicken Noodle Soup. Tuesday was another scheduled day off from school. (With the weather being what it was, likely the kids would have had a snow day anyway!) I made Blender Pancakes for our breakfast that morning. Being cooped up in the house for the second day in a row was starting to affect everyone. So we tried to keep the kids busy with activities. They’d been listening to “Wavin’ Flag” on Alexa quite a bit, so I looked up the back story to talk through the origin of the song with them. Then we got out supplies to make flags. Was it the most exciting idea I’ve ever come up with? Nope. But did it kill twenty minutes of our day? Yep. So it was a win. Hahaha, Acacia’s enthusiasm… :) Brayden was excited to help me make lunch, so he cut up Beef Smoked Sausages to cook. While the rest of our lunch was cooking, the girls helped me make Breakfast Cookie Bars for upcoming Sabbath Sunday breakfasts. Lunch was a very exciting offering of Sausages, Mac and Cheese, and Peas. Mmm, the Breakfast Cookie Bars turned out just right this time. Matt played a game with Brayden and Kiya that afternoon… Then our friend, Cindy, and two of her kids came to hang out. This was such a blessing for our evening as our kids love playing with her kids and Cindy poured love into our family the entire time she was here. Brayden and Kiya helped her make little Pigs in a Blanket to go with our dinner. We enjoyed a fun meal of Chicken Nuggets/Strips, Pigs in a Blanket, Fries, Fruit, and Salad. Wednesday turned out to be a Snow/Cold Day off from school. Anna helped me make a batch of Flourless Chocolate Banana Blender Muffins that morning. Did she get to lick a spatula after we got the batter mixed up? And had Josie made her way into the kitchen and needed a spatula to lick also? The Flourless Chocolate Banana Blender Muffins turned out great and helped us get through the day as everyone needed something to munch on. At lunchtime. Acacia helped me prepare leftovers. I was determined to clean out the fridge so we got out jars of pickles to finish off along with our lunch. She felt it was necessary to open the jars with the rubber gripper. It was a big day for some of the adult Coppingers! Matt, the four older boys, and Malorie had bought tickets to go to KC to watch Messi play. The weather postponed the game, and yet Wednesday’s rescheduled game was still going to be played in freezing cold temps. Did they decide to still go? Yes, they did. Did they realize they were a bit crazy for all of this? Also, yes. Did Arrow fully support their choices?? Everyone gathered at the Castle and we sent off the heavily bundled up soccer fans (Matt, Asa, Justus, Elias, Malorie, Malachi, plus two friends from Lincoln who hopped in). Eva, Kelsey, Arrow, and Little Sweetheart stayed back at the Castle with me to help with kids throughout the afternoon/evening. Eva read lots of books to the littles. At one point I think she had six kids piled around her, but they scattered before I could get a picture of them all. Kelsey played several games at the table. We needed something active to do (it day three in a row of not leaving the house, oy!). So I told the kids that if they cleaned up the living room and play room, we’d be able to set up an Obstacle Course like I had done a few weeks ago. Auggie got a turn with the vacuum. :) Eva captured this shot of me explaining the obstacle course to the kids. It started at the bottom of one set of stairs, went all the way through the living room and playroom, up the other set of stairs, and back. Phew. It involved masking tape and sour cream lids (fancy!). The kids wound their way around the house over and over. Meanwhile, Eva and Kelsey took advantage of the kids being occupied to put their babies in the high chairs to feed them. Look at Lolli’s grandbabies eating like big kids. :) :) :) Knowing the day would be full, I’d put Spicy Ham and Potato Soup in a crock pot that morning. At dinnertime, we served it up – so easy. I had kind of been dreading the day that Matt and so many other adults would be heading out of town, leaving us behind with kids. But wow was it great having Eva and Kelsey and their babies here! I truly enjoyed the day with them and am so thankful for the gals our boys have chosen. OUR DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW ARE AMAZING! MEANWHILE, in Kansas City at the game, Messi scored a goal right in front of our crew. AND, while cheering, several of our peeps made it on television. A couple of friends watching the game from home realized, “Hey, that’s the Coppingers!” so they got screen shots and sent them to our boys. It is so much fun to have this shot of Asa, Justus, Elias, and Malorie! For the record, after this moment, everyone determined that it had, in fact, been worth it to drive all the way there and freeze half-way-to-death to be a part of this moment. Thursday was – guess what? – another Snow/Cold Day off from school. The weather promised to warm up over the weekend, but meanwhile, the temps were still dangerously cold. So, while we considered leaving the house to keep us all from going stir-crazy, we just didn’t want to endure the misery of the cold. So we hunkered down at home, trying to maintain peace while we played. I’d pulled out a pan of Chicken Cheeseballs from the freezer that I’d made a few weeks ago, so we baked them for lunch. I also made two tortilla packages worth of Quesadillas and opened three cans of fruit for our meal. After lunch, I baked two pans of rice and browned 2.5 pounds of hamburger meat. I stirred all of the rice and cooked meat into a large pan and turned it into a form of Taco Rice Skillet for our upcoming Sunday Lunch. That afternoon, I pulled kids into the kitchen to help me make Peanut Butter Honey Fudge. I had almost forgotten this recipe, but it was a perfect treat to make since we were cooped up and needed an activity. Brayden got to to do the stove-top part of this. Then we scooped the mixture into fun molds, then the rest into a dish. Dinner that night was Costco’s Tortelloni with Sauce plus Steamed Broccoli. A few years ago, I did a price breakdown to share that this entire meal only cost $1.41/person. Want to see what the cost is after inflation 2.5 years later? I did the math!! After dinner, we ate some Peanut Butter Honey Fudge! Then we spent the rest of the evening playing Charades. Oh, and Kelsey sent me this delicious picture of their dinner that night: Simple Pizza Chicken Bake! With a January full of sickness and a February full of freezing cold temps and a household full of constant intense-kid-needs, I felt like I’d been hanging on for dear life. I have been getting up early each morning to have some glorious time in the Word and in prayer. But otherwise, I’m on the go all day with needs piled on top of each other. God made it very clear to me on Friday morning that I needed to meet my own needs so that I could effectively care for my family. So as soon as I was able, I packed myself up and headed out the door. (The kids were able to be back in school that day!) I sat at Panera by the fire with a cup of coffee, resting and working. In a setting like this, my work is restful, which is a blessing. Feeling refreshed and enjoying my alone time, I headed next door to Costco. I looked through clothing for clearance sales, then filled the bottom of my cart with fresh produce. I then decided that since I was kid-free, I should stock up on everything we’d finished off at home during the past couple of months. Did I need a second cart? Yes. But did I get one? No. I just kept piling my one cart higher and higher. Craziness. Back at home, Matt and I got groceries brought in and put away before picking up kids from school. I had a smile back on my face again, thanks to the down time I’d enjoyed. Anna washed grapes for our dinner while Brayden and Kiya helped with other parts of our meal. We had Grilled Cheese Sandwiches, Tomato Soup, Onion Rings, and Grapes. Saturday morning, Malorie and I left all the kids home with the guys while we headed to church for a Ladies’ Brunch. The speaker was none other than our very dear Kelsey. The morning was incredibly wonderful in so many ways and I’m so thankful we got to do this. Back at home, Asa, Arrow, Justus, and Little Sweetheart had joined our crew so I went home to kids, grandbabies, and big boys. I felt so filled and blessed. The Italian Cream Cheese Chicken I’d started before the brunch smelled good when we got back! That evening, we were planning to celebrate Justus’ birthday a week late, and this was his dinner choice. Malachi had made a batch of Hot Cocoa while we were gone. I love that he does this! Brayden and Kiya helped me make Butterscotch Bars for the night’s birthday celebration. We slid them into the oven, I finished this post, we got some cleaning done, then the family joined for Justus’ birthday. And that was our week!

Title: The Federal Supremacists Write a Ticket Good for One Ride in Williams v. Reed

Mostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent Josh Blackman | 2.22.2025 9:07 PM Last week, I taught the Supreme Court's anti-commandeering cases in Constitutional Law. The precedent can be stated simply. New York v. United States held that Congress cannot compel state legislatures to enact legislation. Printz v. United States held that Congress cannot compel state executive branch officials to enforce federal law. And NFIB v. Sebelius held that Congress cannot compel people to engage in economic activity. However, Congress can compel state judges to enforce federal law. Article VI, Clause 2 maintains that "the Judges in every State shall be bound" by the supreme law of the land. In Printz, Justice Scalia acknowledged that since the framing, state judges have enforced federal law. A student asked if Congress could commandeer state courts, as well as state judges. The answer to this question is complex. In my view, the answer should be no. I developed this thesis in a 2016 article in the Illinois Law Review, titled State Judicial Sovereignty. In short, if a state legislature creates a court of true general jurisdiction, then a state judge can hear any federal cause of action. But if a state legislature divests a state court of jurisdiction over some federal cause of action, the action cannot be heard. Congress cannot commandeer the state legislature to vest their courts with jurisdiction, and the Supremacy Clause does not empower the courts to establish that jurisdiction. Remember, state court jurisdiction comes from the state legislature, and not the Constitution. Regrettably, the Supreme Court rejected my approach in Haywood v. Drown (2009). In this case, which most people have never heard of, New York divested its courts of jurisdiction to hear damage claims against correction officials. As a result, those courts would have lacked jurisdiction to hear Section 1983 suits against prison guards. Justice Stevens's majority opinion held that this jurisdictional statute was actually an attempt to immunize prison officials under Section 1983. Haywood was 5-4. Justice Thomas wrote the dissent, which was only joined in part by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justice Scalia and Alito. The quartet agreed that New York should prevail under longstanding precedent. But only Justice Thomas was willing to go a step further and say those precedents were wrong. In short, even if state judges are bound to enforce federal law, state legislatures have complete and total control over the jurisdiction of the state courts. If a plaintiff does not like those rules, he can bring a Section 1983 suit in federal court. It has long bothered me that Justice Scalia did not join all of Justice Thomas's dissent in Haywood, but such is life. (Update: I previously wrote the case was 8-1, which it sort of was for the issue I was talking about, but it is better to call it 5-4.) Fast-forward to the present. On Friday, the Supreme Court decided Williams v. Reed. On the holding, the Court split 5-4. Justice Kavanuagh's majority opinion held that state courts must allow a Section 1983 claim to proceed where a state exhaustion requirement "in effect immunizes state officials" from liability. In my view, this case goes beyond Haywood. The Court expands federal court oversight of state court jurisdiction. I see this decision as vindicating the supremacy of federal courts. You may recall that Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kagan, and Justice Kavanaugh dissented in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern. I see that position as parallel to Williams. Of course, Justices Sotomayor and Jackson joined the majority, though I suppose the context was different enough. Yet I'm not sure that the Chief was fully on board with the Haywood expansion. Justice Kavanaugh explains how limited this opinion was. He stresses the Court reverses on a "narrow ground" and "emphasize[s]" the opinion is "narrow." Kavanaugh writes that his decision "resolves this dispute but is careful not to go beyond this Court's existing precedents." You know a five-member majority is fragile when this sort of language is added. Chief Justice Roberts assigned this opinion to Justice Kavanaugh. I suspect the Chief then conditioned his joining on this sort of limiting language. The federal supremacists issued a ticket good for one ride. Justice Thomas wrote the Williams dissent, which had two parts. Part I was joined only by Thomas. And Part II was joined by Thomas, as well as Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett. Part II argues that the majority misconstrued, and indeed expanded Haywood. I find that analysis quite compelling. I also think that the issue was waived, and that Justice Kavanaugh botched the facial/as-applied analysis. (I have to imagine this part was very important for Justice Barrett's join, especially in light of NetChoice.) But Justice Thomas was alone in Part I, regrettably. Thomas repeats his call that Haywood was wrongly decided based on "first principles." (Chief Justice Rehnquist used this phrase in Lopez.) This case is straightforward under first principles. Our federal system gives States "plenary authority to decide whether their local courts will have subject-matter jurisdiction over federal causes of action." Haywood v. Drown, 556 U. S. 729, 743 (2009) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The Constitution allows States to hear federal claims in their courts, but it does "not impose a duty on state courts to do so." Id., at 747. Thus, "[o]nce a State exercises its sovereign prerogative to deprive its courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over a federal cause of action, it is the end of the matter as far as the Constitution is concerned." Id., at 749. . . . Our precedents also err in establishing the requirement at issue here—that state jurisdictional rules be "neutral," even in the absence of a directly conflicting federal law. See infra, at 5. The Supremacy Clause does not of its own force"constrai[n] the States' authority to define the subject-matter jurisdiction of their own courts." Haywood, 556 U. S., at 750 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Thomas also explains that plaintiffs are free to bring suit in federal court. This case is much ado about little. Justice Thomas also wrote a glorious footnote that takes a potshot at Charles Reich. I suspect Justice Alito regrets not joining this footnote about his former constitutional law professor. (Alito has many times told the story about how Reich abandoned his class in the middle of the semester to go to San Francisco.) * Petitioners' suit implicates other precedents that may not withstand scrutiny. I doubt that petitioners have a true due process interest in "mere Government benefits and entitlements." Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC, 598 U. S. 175, 201, n. 3 (2023) (THOMAS, J., concurring). Tellingly,the Court's original expansion of the Due Process Clause into this context came without meaningful legal analysis. The Court simply highlighted the social importance of "entitlements," which had come to make up "[m]uch of the existing wealth in this country," and which only the poor had been theretofore unable to effectively enforce. See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254, 262, and n. 8 (1970) (citing C. Reich, Individual Rights and Social Welfare: The Emerging Legal Issues, 74 Yale L. J. 1245, 1255(1965); C. Reich, The New Property, 73 Yale L. J. 733 (1964)). As Justice Black recognized at the time, it "strains credulity" as a textual matter "to say that the government's promise of charity to an individual is property" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. 397 U. S., at 275 (dissenting opinion). Amen. Thomas also casts doubt on whether Section 1983 even creates a cause of action. Here, Thomas cites an important new article by Tyler Lindley. Moreover, further examination may be required as to whether §1983 can provide petitioners a cause of action in any event. Cf. T. Lindley, Anachronistic Readings of Section 1983, 75 Ala. L. Rev. 897, 900–901 (2024) (contending that, as originally understood, §1983 did notprovide a freestanding cause of action). This statement is consistent with Thomas's opinion in DeVillier v. Texas, and his dissent in Wilson v. Hawaii. These cases recognize that the Constitution does not create positive causes of action for relief. Conservatives routinely call on Justice Thomas to retire. Would any replacement continue to make such important and principled contributions to the law? Does anyone else have the right combination of courage and curiosity? I am doubtful.

Title: NVIDIA To Surge 20% With Earnings?

CHINA - 2025/02/13: In this photo illustration, an Nvidia logo is displayed on the screen of a ... [+] smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) See more on Trefis.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Feb. 26, 2025, after the market closes. The semiconductor leader currently holds a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia reported revenue of $113 billion, with operating profits of $71 billion and a net income of $63 billion. The stock’s reaction post-earnings will largely depend on how the results and future outlook align with investor expectations. Analyzing historical performance can be beneficial for event-driven traders: either by understanding past trends to position themselves before the earnings release or by examining the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings to make informed trades the day after the announcement. Specifically, past data suggests the maximum positive one-day movement post earnings, was a little over 20%. Full analysis below. Separately, see our counter scenario on – Nvidia’s 50% Downside. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that Nvidia is a pretty volatile stock. Over the past five years, there have been 20 earnings reports, with 11 positive and 9 negative one-day returns, indicating positive 1D returns approximately 55% of the time. This percentage increases to 58% when considering data from the last three years. The median of the 11 positive returns is 4.9%, while the median of the 9 negative returns is -5.9%. Additional data for observed returns 5-days (5D) and 30-days (30D) post-earnings are summarized in the table below. NVDA returns 1 day, 5 days, and 30-days post earnings A potentially less risky strategy (though its effectiveness depends on the strength of the correlation) involves understanding the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings. Identifying pairs with the highest correlation can guide trading decisions. For instance, if 1D and 5D returns exhibit the highest correlation, a trader might consider a "long" position for the next five days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data based on five-year and three-year (more recent) histories. Note that "1D_5D" refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns At times, the performance of peer companies can influence a stock’s post-earnings reaction, with market adjustments potentially beginning before the earnings announcement. The table below presents historical data comparing Nvidia post-earnings performance with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings 1D returns. Peer stocks post-earnings one day (1D) return Not too happy about the volatile nature of NVDA stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and Russell 2000), delivering strong returns for investors.

Editor Economy International Man, Nick Giambruno “It was the single most important financial event of my career.” My friend and resource investing legend Rick Rule once shared this with me, reflecting on his experience in the uranium market during the last bull cycle—where extreme supply and demand imbalances triggered massive booms and busts. Rick was referring to Paladin Energy, a uranium stock that skyrocketed during uranium’s last bull market from less than one cent ($0.007) Australian dollar (AUD) per share at its bottom in April 2003 to AUD $9.57 at its peak in April 2007. It was a peak gain of over 130,000%—a greater than 1,000-fold increase. In other words, a $1,000 investment could have exploded into more than $1 million—had someone picked the bottom and top perfectly. Of course, that is not realistic, but as we can see in the chart below, even being within a year of the absolute bottom and top would have been enough to generate some phenomenal returns. Other uranium stocks also multiplied their share prices during the last bull market. However, Paladin was a rare and unique example. It was the best-performing company in the industry during the previous cycle. However, as stunning as Paladin’s performance was, it’s important to remember that past performance does not indicate future results—for any investment. I suspect it won’t be long before Western governments turn to nuclear energy in a big way. There are indications they are already doing that. In short, the Green Scam delusion is an enormous market distortion—a blessing in disguise. Distortions in the market allow shrewd speculators to get positioned for big potential profits as they collide with reality. It’s making uranium’s already attractive supply/demand situation even more appealing. Uranium mining stocks stand to be a primary beneficiary of this trend. In short, it is difficult for producers to ramp up production while uranium demand is rising. It often takes years for them to catch up. As a result, price is the only way for the market to resolve itself. That’s why the uranium price can have extraordinary spikes. However, the uranium market often doesn’t just settle into equilibrium during these periods. The uranium price often overshoots where it needs to go to balance the market, creating an enormous bull market. It’s a cycle that has played out three times before, and I think it will occur again soon. Looking at the Big Picture for uranium, I see a precarious supply situation, a long lead time to develop new mines (roughly ten years), dwindling inventories, and an unstable geopolitical situation in which countries are scrambling to secure their energy supplies. Yet, at the same time, there is growing (inflexible) demand for new nuclear power plants. With supply shrinking and demand rising, I think the stage is set for uranium prices to overshoot to the upside, just as we saw in the previous three bull market cycles with similar dynamics. The energy markets aren’t the only place where massive disruptions are unfolding. A dangerous combination of sky-high debt, relentless money printing, and deep cultural and political shifts is creating unprecedented economic instability. We are entering an era of volatility unlike anything we’ve seen in modern history—and those who fail to prepare could see their wealth and freedom evaporate.

Title: Exclusive — Nate Morris: America Has to Fight Back Against the Climate Change, 'ESG Mafia'

Kentucky businessman and potential Senate Republican candidate Nate Morris on Breitbart News Saturday said that America has to fight back against the environment, social, and governance (ESG) “mafia,” noting how large Wall Street firms push leftist policies on corporations. Morris spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle as he considers a potential run for Senate to replace the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). The Kentucky businessman, who founded a waste management company, said that the pressure he received to back ESG policies was like nothing else, noting that the waste management business often has mafia connections, citing the hit television show the Sopranos. “I’ve never seen extortion like what I saw with the ESG mafia and the thugs that try to push corporate America into doing things that satisfy a political agenda,” Morris said on Breitbart News Saturday. ESG was one of the major vectors by which Wall Street firms, namely asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, could push publicly listed companies to back leftist policies such as anti-climate change policies, diversity quotas, among others. Companies, facing a backlash, stopped employing these controversial policies. Morris then said he invested in Strive, a firm backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, that seeks to push anti-ESG policies, and challenge BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. “We got to fight the ESG mafia that has been coming against our corporate leaders as an extension of politics to satisfy the leftist agenda,” he remarked. Morris said that the country needs to expose “ESG for the scam it is.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.

February 22, 2025 17:15 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, all dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until April 14, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit. Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck as well as certain of Merck’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide. The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China’s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck’s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck’s ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 “there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%” “primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Merck class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Merck class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon just sold a massive amount of his company’s stock. New SEC filings show Dimon sold a total of 866,361 shares at a price of $269.83 on Thursday, worth a whopping $233.77 million. According to the SEC Form 4 filing, the shares sold are attributed to various entities including his family, GRATs, LLCs, and his spouse. As Dimon executed the sale on February 20th, shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) sank from record highs at around $278 down to $266. In February of last year, Dimon initiated his first-ever sale of the company’s stock since becoming CEO in 2005. He then executed another sale in April, completing a combined $182 million in sales in 2024. Although Dimon has not made public comments on the sales, a company filing said they’re part of a predetermined plan for “financial diversification and tax-planning purposes” and that Dimon “continues to believe the company’s prospects are very strong and his stake in the company will remain very significant.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have surged 44% in the last year amid a broad spike in bank stocks, driven by a resilient economy and record-breaking earnings.

Title: Software engineering job openings hit 5-year low amid industry shift
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/106878-software-engineering-job-openings-plummet-35-five-year.html
Time Published: 2025-02-22T15:50:00Z

Cutting corners: The software engineering job market has experienced a significant downturn, with job openings hitting a five-year low, according to an analysis of data from Indeed by Practical Engineer. The statistics reveal a stark 35 percent decrease in software developer job listings compared to five years ago, marking a dramatic shift in the industry's employment landscape. This decline is particularly noteworthy when compared to other sectors. While the overall job market has seen a 10 percent increase in listings since February 2020, software development positions have plummeted. This contrasts sharply with growth in areas such as construction (25 percent), accounting (24 percent), and electrical engineering (20 percent). The software development sector has also experienced very volatile fluctuations in recent years. Job listings more than doubled during the pandemic-era boom of 2021 and 2022, outpacing all other industries. However, this surge was followed by an equally dramatic fall, with current vacancy numbers 3.5 times lower than their mid-2022 peak. Trend in software development job postings in various countries - Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer Several factors contribute to this decline. The end of zero-percent interest rates has had a significant impact on the tech industry, affecting hiring practices, venture capital funding, and the survival of tech startups. However, this alone doesn't explain the hiring slowdown and layoffs at highly profitable Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google, according to author Gergely Orosz. He posits that many companies may still be adjusting after over-recruiting in 2021-2022, leading to a more cautious approach to hiring. Additionally, the rise of generative AI and LLMs may be influencing the job market. These technologies have shown particular promise in coding – 75 percent of engineers reported the use of AI coding tools in a recent survey. Some speculate that companies might be adopting a "wait and see" approach, assessing the potential productivity gains from these tools before expanding their engineering teams. Salesforce's recent decision to keep its software engineering headcount flat while reporting a 30 percent productivity gain from AI tools exemplifies this trend. However, this also raises questions about product development and market fit, as the company simultaneously plans to hire additional salespeople. The emergence of highly efficient small teams at companies like Linear and Bluesky challenges traditional notions of engineering team size. These companies have achieved significant user bases and product adoption with remarkably small engineering teams, suggesting a potential shift toward leaner, more efficient development processes. All job postings on Indeed vs software development job postings - Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer Orosz also points out that Indeed's data may not provide a complete picture of the job market. The platform may be losing popularity for posting software engineering jobs, particularly among startups and some Big Tech companies. For instance, Microsoft lists more software-related jobs on its own site than are reflected in Indeed's data. So, while the Indeed data should be considered directionally correct, indicating a genuine decrease in developer job listings, it may not fully represent hiring trends in startups or accurately track Big Tech hiring. Still, it is clear that the software engineering job market is undergoing significant changes, influenced by economic factors, technological advancements, and evolving company strategies.

It’s halftime at Twickenham and Scotland lead England 10-7. Thank you for your company today. Ireland win in Cardiff and all roads lead to a meeting with France at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday week. Man of the match Jamison Gibson-Park 🗣 "They're an unbelievable team, a proud nation, they showed that today."🗣 "It would be a dangerous thing to do to come over here with preconceived ideas."Player of the Match Jamison Gibson-Park after Ireland's battling win in Cardiff. #WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/Lgv9nrNqt5 MATCH REPORT: Gerry Thornley has his say. “The home side were, as expected, much improved; beyond recognition in truth. As was always liable to be the case, Matt Sherratt had injected enthusiasm, energy and no little cohesion in his first game in charge. Their set pieces were strong and with a much more balanced 9-10-12-13 combination their attack had variety, shape and width. Ireland’s initially confident and smooth start unravelled in large part through ill-discipline and especially scrum penalties. This was compounded by Garry Ringrose incurring a red card following a bunker review for his 35th-minute high hit on Ben Thomas, and Ireland were relieved and indebted to this being a 20-minute red card, not least as Bundee Aki was an ideal replacement.” You can read the full match report here Scotland lead England 10-7 at Twickenham after 24 minutes. James Lowe produced another brilliant performance. He’s what he had to say about a tough afternoon in Cardiff. One of Ireland's key men yet again this afternoon.Great to chat to James Lowe live from Cardiff.#WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/EM4moAonb0 PLAYER RATINGS: Johnny Watterson gives James Lowe, Jamison Gibson-Park and Jack Conan 8/10.

Again If you like what you see, please like share and follow, cause I've f#%k all other reasons to do them! 🙏❤️#SixNations #WalvIre @IrishRugby #FinlayBealham #Rugby pic.twitter.com/4dyhpxFZf1 Easterby: “We’re pleased with the result. There’s lots of things we could have done better. I’m pleased with how we got ourselves out of a hole.” ⌚️ Sam Prendergast slotted the three points for Ireland against Wales to steer his side to a win and a Triple Crown in Cardiff 🙌#Breitling #DefiningMoment @Breitling pic.twitter.com/MvYnOUZPWh Watching the Andrew Porter incident again. No wrap from replacement tighthead prop Thomas his arm in tucked and even though it is chest to shoulder, it is not a legitimate attempt to tackle. Therefore should have been a yellow card. Johnny Watterson’s player ratings are going through the subbing machine and will be available here presently. Simon Easterby, calm and measured in victory. Acknowledged some of the shortcomings, gave credit to Wales, which they deserved and pointed to the fact that his tea showed character to see out a match that got sticky.

A stunning cross-field kick to James Lowe! Jamie Osborne is there to collect the ball and score!! #GuinnessW6N pic.twitter.com/5Eq7cq0Lz8 Johnny Watterson’s player ratings, lot of red pen you’d suspect, Gerry Thornley’s match report and all the reaction coming here. That’s a 14th Triple Crown for Ireland. MATCH SNYOPSIS: Ireland led 7-0, trailed 13-10 at half-time and 18-10 early in the second half, before Gibson-Park, Lowe and Osborne combined for the latter’s try and then Prendergast’s boot saw them home. Ringrose had a yellow card upgraded to a red card. Ireland win a Triple Crown. Performance was well below par, individually and collectively. To Ireland the spoils, including a Triple Crown but to Wales the plaudits in performance terms. Coming off a 14-match losing streak, that’s now gone to 15, and given very little hope but the home side was so courageous in defeat, playing some cracking attacking rugby to boot. Ireland will be relieved rather than happy. Finlay Bealham, Ryan Baird and Bundee Aki made a huge difference on their arrival. Full-time: Wales 18 Ireland 27 80 mins: Prendergast takes on long range penalty that drops short after Beirne won a ruck penalty. Wales with one last effort in chasing a bonus point. 77 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Great counter-ruck from Ireland led by van der Flier supported by Gus McCarthy and Jack Boyle leads to a penalty. Henshaw and Baird with key tackles in the build-up. Prendergast is unerring. Gibson-Park announced as man of the match. No argument. Brilliant again. Conor Murray on at scrumhalf Wales 18 Ireland 27 75 mins: Gus McCarthy on for captain, Sheehan. Brilliant again from Osborne in tidying up. Wales 18 Ireland 24 72 mins: Brilliant response from Wales and Ellis Mee is deemed to have scored a try by referee Ridley. His on-field decision is try. Tempest the TMO is rocking and rolling the angle, I think his hand is in touch. 47 angles later. Knock-on. Hits short and it’s a knock-on. That’s unfortunate for Wales. Another superb passage of play in attack. Ireland are very, very lucky. Good work from Hansen, who’s now been replaced by Jack Crowley and Osborne. Boyle and Bealham win a scrum penalty. Crowley is on at fullback, Osborne moves to the wing. Wales 18 Ireland 24 Jack Boyle becomes the 12th St Michael’s College old boy to be capped at senior level by Ireland; 11 have been in the last decade. Michael’s capped players, year of debut and number of caps. 1984 - Derek McGrath (5) 2014 - Noel Reid (1) 2016 - Dan Leavy (11) *Luke McGrath (19) 2017 - Rory O’Loughlin (1) *James Ryan (70) 2018 - *Ross Byrne (22) 2020 - *Ronan Kelleher (39) *Max Deegan (2) 2021 - *Ryan Baird (25) *Harry Byrne (4) 2025 - *Jack Boyle (1) * - still active 69 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. A blood splattered Bundee Aki wins a penalty at a ruck, clamped on after Sheehan’s tackle. Prendergast is going to take it on. It’s two metres inside the Welsh half. The outhalf strikes it superbly. Gibson-Park with a brilliant relieving kick from the re-start. Jack Boyle is on for his debut. Wales 18 Ireland 24 68 mins: Porter is hit in the head by Thomas, referee thinks it’s chest. Ian Tempest agrees. NO further sanction. NO foul play. Wales 18 Ireland 21 64 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Wonderful catch and kick from Lowe. Ryan back on for McCarthy. Gibson-Park with a wonderful sniping break. Hansen denied a try, held up brilliantly by Murray and Morgan. Ireland were on penalty advantage. Hansen might have given Sheehan a scoring pass in hindsight. The Irish hooker and captain asks Prendergast to kick the penalty and the young outhalf bisects the posts. Wales 18 Ireland 21 62 mins: It’s another brilliant counter-attack from Wales who are playing without fear. Width to their attack, first instinct is to offload. Joe Roberts is on for try scorer Tom Rogers. Free-kick Ireland ats scrum, the first after Welsh loosehead Nicky Smith has gone off. Wales 18 Ireland 18 58 mins: Osborne has done superbly in the air for the most part. It’s been a superb post interval response from Easterby’s side. The one caveat is the discipline. 11 penalties now, the latest for a neck roll. Wales 18 Ireland 18 55 mins: TRY OSBORNE. That’s a great reaction from Ireland. On penalty advantage Ireland pack Sheehan, O’Mahony X2, Baird carry and Gibson-Park with a cross-kick with the boot is tapped back brilliantly by Lowe into the waiting arms of Osborne. Prendergast misses the conversion. It’s all tied up. Wales 18 Ireland 18 53 mins: Ireland have conceded nine penalties to date. Fantastic piece of skill from Prendergast, brilliant spiral for a 50/22 after great play from Osborne. Ireland deep inside the Welsh 22. Wales 18 Ireland 13 52 mins: Henry Thomas on for WillGriff John for Wales. McCarthy with a superb play. Ireland scrum. Anscombe off for a HIA. Jarrod Evans is on. No referee changes his mind. Penalty Wales. Wales 18 Ireland 13 50 mins: McCarthy is back on for Ryan having passed his HIA. Wales with some lovely running angles and offloading but Henshaw comes up with a brilliant turnover. Great line kick from Prendergast and Ireland are back up to 15 players, as Aki replaces Ringrose. Wales 18 Ireland 13 47 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Ireland win a scrum penalty inside the Welsh 22, more direct around the fringes, where there is space. Baird involved several times. Finlay Bealham on for Clarkson. Wales 18 Ireland 13 42 mins: ROGERS TRY. Ireland are panicky. Osborne kicks away possession, Sheehan gives away possession and it all ends in a try for TOM ROGERS. Flamboyant finish. Ireland again the architect of their downfall. Anscombe misses the conversion. Conan off with an injury. Ryan Baird, who didn’t expect to play today, is on. Wales 18 Ireland 10 Ireland will have to survive another 10-minutes a man down until Ringrose’s 20-minute red card is played out and they can bring on Bundee Aki. Referee Ridley confirms the red card ruling as the second half gets under way. “High degree of danger and no mitigation.” James Ryan is on for McCarthy (HIA) Okay, how to unpack that. Ireland conceded four scrum penalties, two against Porter, two against Clarkson. Apart from the opening 15-minutes, they have been very disjointed, dogged by basic mistakes, handling hasn’t been good and some of the decision making has been flawed too. They will rue that missed opportunity when Osborne’s pass to Ringrose went to turf as a try beckoned. That would have out them 17-3 up. Wales though deserve hue credit for the manner in which they have hung around and to be honest played the better attacking rugby. They’ve troubled Ireland particularly out wide. Ireland will need to be a lot more precise and composed in possession. They’ll need to sort out the scrum, be better disciplined and connected in attack and defence. The high point of the Irish half from an Irish perspective The Power of Jack Conan 😮‍💨💪#GuinnessM6N @IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/aIUIWgCk6d RED CARD: Ireland’s Garry Ringrose’s yellow card has been upgraded to a 20-minute red card. Head on head contact on Ben Thomas. The correct decision. Needed to be lower. Half-time: Wales 13 Ireland 10 40(+2) mins: TRY Morgan. Wales on penalty advantage from the lineout after Ireland come in from the side at the maul; van der Flier pinged. Clarkson saved a try with a great tackle. Anscombe kicks the penalty to the corner. Rowlands takes, backs join maul. Wales pound the Irish line, stopped by millimetres until captain, Morgan forces his way over. Anscombe converts. Wales have deserved that. Wales 13 Ireland 10 36 mins: Prendergast hits an upright with a long-range penalty. Superbly struck but the outhalf then knocks on a high ball. Ireland are at sixes and sevens defensively, looking a little ragged on both sides of the ball and there are simply too many missed straight up tackles. Ireland concede a fourth scrum penalty. Leads to a schemozzle. Seven penalties Ireland have conceded, four at scrum time. Wales 6 Ireland 10 31 mins: Ireland are guilty of ball watching at a ruck. Van der Flier protects the ball, but no one goes in to move it on in the absence of Gibson-Park and Ireland penalised for holding on. Osborne with a superb tackle at Wales go on the attack again. They are inside the Irish 22. Ireland are penalised, Ringrose not rolling away. The television match official Ian Tempest advises the referee Christophe Ridley to look at a Ringrose tackle previously. Ringrose receives a yellow card and it will be reviewed by FPRO, Matteo Liperini (Italy). 34 mins: Anscombe kicks the penalty. Wales 6 Ireland 10 30 mins: Should have been a try for Ireland, great work by McCarthy and Peter O’Mahony in the build-up, the visitors sweep wide, but Osborne throws a poor pass. Ringrose was in for a walk in try, if the pass had gone to hand. A long pass was required but Osborne slapping the turf tells you he felt he should have done better. Smith is back in the front row. Scrum is completed. Wales 3 Ireland 10 27 mins: Good work from Ireland, good strike, Conan gets off the base of the scrum superbly and Lowe completes the clearance with his left foot. Wales though are back on the attack and they’re playing some lovely rugby. Wales 3 Ireland 10 24 mins: A poor enough re-start from Prendergast, too far and Tomos Williams with a superb clearance into the Irish half. Ireland kick away possession, Wales get it to the edge. Sheehan rescues his team by covering a kick through but Osborne doesn’t get much on the clearance. Brilliant work from Wales down the touchline but Williams knocks on what would have been a try scoring pass from Jac Morgan. That’s a huge let off for Ireland. Wales 3 Ireland 10 22 mins: Brilliant take from Beirne at the re-start, Sheehan knocked on though and Ireland are caught offside. Anscombe kicks the easy penalty. Wales 3 Ireland 10 19 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Gareth Thomas (Ospreys) on for Nicky Smith at loosehead prop. We’re about to have another scrum. Wales 3-0 up on penalties. What will the change do? Ireland win a scrum penalty. Thomas, the new boy penalised. Prendergast points at the posts and thumps it over. Wales 0 Ireland 10 15 mins: Lovely fluency from Ireland in attack, going from one touchline to the other. Move ends when Lowe goes through a gap but loses the ball in contact seven metres from the Welsh line. Wales win a third scrum penalty. Clarkson called again, this time by Gianluca Gnecchi, the other assistant referee. Worrying for Ireland. All three officials have called a scrum penalty against Ireland. Wales 0 Ireland 7 11 mins: Ireland are penalised at the second scrum, this time Thomas Clarkson for dropping his bind. Josh van der Flier reclaims an overthrow at a lineout. Hansen kicks through but Blair Murray rescues Wales and the home side clears. Good work from Lowe and Ringrose. Prendergast kicks the ball away. Wales 0 Ireland 7 8 mins: Good clearance from Jamison Gibson-Park from the re-start, Tom Rogers beats Jamie Osborne to Gareth Anscombe’s up and under. Wales get some continuity. The home side penalised, Elliot Dee for a tip tackle on a ruck clear-out. Tadhg Beirne inverted. Ireland clear but Henshaw knocks on from the long throw over the back. Wales 0 Ireland 7 6 mins: TRY Jack Conan. Superb from Conan, great power and a one-handed fend to stretch and reach over the Welsh line. Prendergast kicks the conversion. Wales 0 Ireland 7 5 mins: Good direct running from Ireland, Taulupe Faletau penalised two metres from his line. The visitors take it off the tail. Joe McCarthy great carry, James Lowe too. Wales 0 Ireland 0 4 mins: A bit of aerial tennis ends in a Welsh knock-on and the first scrum of the match. Collapses. Re-set. Andrew Porter penalised. Call came in from assistant referee Nika Amashukeli. Nothing in it. Ball had gone. Should have been play on. Jack Conan wins turnover. Mack Hansen counter-ruck. Garry Ringrose great grubber for a 50/22. Wales 0 Ireland 0 Ireland kickoff through Sam Prendergast. Roof closed, wonderful atmosphere, passionate rendition of the anthems. Let’s go.

Time for the anthems. Tommy Bowe knows a thing or two about Irish and Welsh rugby. What is the secret to Ireland's rugby success? 🤔@TommyBowe has his say 🗣️ #BBCRugby #SixNations pic.twitter.com/C0YdCVQPrL Right a little under half an hour to go to kickoff. Johnny Watterson will have green and red markers as he does the Player Ratings post match, Gerry Thornley will have his match report and I’ll keep you up to date with all the post match reaction. Stay here and all that will be coming your way on the blog. We will link everything to this blog. Statistics, the last refuge of the scoundrel. And I’d know. One that caught the eye was that Ireland had just 47% possession in their first two games – the second lowest after Italy (44%) – but they have enjoyed more territory (56%) than any other side and made more entries into the opposition 22 (22) than anyone else. Other reasons to be cheerful from an Irish perspective. Wales have conceded the most (26) and been awarded the fewest (14) penalties of any side in the Six Nations. We'll wear our new alternate white kit in Cardiff on Saturday to help supporters impacted by colour blindness! ⚪️#TeamOfUs pic.twitter.com/h1D22FiGck The reason that Ireland will wear their changed strip today. In a significant move to support spectators and viewers with colour vision deficiency (CVD), Ireland will wear their new alternate white kit against Wales. This decision, driven by new World Rugby regulations, aims to prevent kit clashes that can be problematic for those affected by CVD. Colour vision deficiency, commonly known as colour blindness, affects approximately one in 12 men and one in 200 women. The traditional red jerseys of Wales and the green jerseys of Ireland create a challenging visual scenario for those with CVD, making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams on the pitch. The stage is set! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿#TeamOfUs pic.twitter.com/dPIAtAvJ2L Today’s teams WALES: Blair Murray (Scarlets); Tom Rogers (Scarlets), Max Llewellyn (Gloucester), Ben Thomas (Cardiff), Ellis Mee (Scarlets); Gareth Anscombe (Gloucester), Tomos Williams (Gloucester); Nicky Smith (Leicester Tigers), Elliot Dee (Dragons), WillGriff John (Sale Sharks), Will Rowlands (Racing 92), Dafydd Jenkins (Exeter Chiefs), Jac Morgan (Ospreys) (capt), Tommy Reffell (Leicester Tigers), Taulupe Faletau (Cardiff).

Referee: Christophe Ridley (England) Assistant Referees: Nika Amashukeli (Georgia), Gianluca Gnecchi (Italy) TMO: Ian Tempest (England) FPRO: Matteo Liperini (Italy) BREAKING NEWS: Cian Prendergast has had to withdraw from the Ireland bench because of illness and his place goes to Ryan Baird. That’s very unfortunate for the Connacht captain but Ireland are fortunate to have such an accomplished stand-in. A word from the coaches. Simon Easterby: “Playing Wales in Cardiff is one of the great tests and we know the challenge that awaits us. “With a new coaching set-up in place, Wales will be re-energised and determined to impress in front of a vocal home support. “There will also be a huge Irish travelling support which, when added to the closed roof and the great respect and rivalry between the two nations, will add to an electric atmosphere.” He added: “We have made a few changes to the squad this week, some of which were enforced, and we’re confident that the 23 we have selected are primed and ready to go. “Dan’s (Sheehan) selection as captain is recognition of his high standing within the squad, both on and off the pitch. I have no doubt that he will relish the opportunity to lead Ireland for the first time. “Equally, I would also like to congratulate Jack Boyle on his inclusion in the matchday squad for the first time. Jack has impressed for his province Leinster, and in the national training camps over the last number of months, and he’s a young forward with a bright future.” Wales interim head coach Matt Sherratt: “We’re looking forward to the challenge of facing Ireland. We have spoken this week about being brave, but not reckless and making sure everyone knows their roles. “We also know that keeping our discipline will be huge. Everyone is excited for our first home game of the Six Nations. “The atmosphere Wales fans create at the Principality Stadium is incredible, and playing at home is something the players really look forward to.” Love the sentiment behind this image.

C'mon @IrishRugby - you got this!#TeamOfUs #ShouldertoShoulder pic.twitter.com/RKZR9pBOMK For those of us who have been around a while (!) I remember the Triple Crowns of 1982 and 1985 - our 5th and 6th ever in history. Glory days ! Today we’ll be going for our 8th this century after 04, 06, 07, 09, 18, 22 & 23. @IrishRugby has come a long way …. Welsh Twitter is certainly going all-in on the victory of the Wales Under-20 side as a positive harbinger for this afternoon’s game at the Principality Stadium. I am half expecting to see them point to the fact that the Irish 20s and the senior side were/are in the changed white, and I use that description loosely, strip. Maybe it’s an omen. A little under an hour and a half to go to kickoff in Cardiff. Just enough time to grab a bite and a drink of choice and read Gerry Thornley’s preview Former Wales great Jonathan Davies things that the Welsh 20s can inspire their senior brethern. Great win for Wales U20s just the boost Welsh rugby needed. 👍💪👏👏👏 Time to rip the plaster off the Ireland Under-20s performance in the 20-12 defeat to Wales at Rodney Parade last night. Once again they dominated territory and possession but the same old failings came back to haunt them in the opposition 22, leaving behind oodles of points. To their credit Wales defended with courage and grit, making over 228 tackles to their opponents 67 but the visitors made that job easier with an attack that lacked shape and cohesion and a multitude of handling errors. Nathan Johns was in Newport and here’s his thoughts on Ireland’s shortcomings. The best of both worlds for one Welsh fan. About to make the long long drove to Monmouth services for a @GreggsOfficial And while I’m in the area i thought i might catch Wales playing Ireland in the #GuinnessM6N Say hi if you’re about! pic.twitter.com/S1EIYYQqlp Go well Ireland 🙌#SUAF ☘️ | @SixNationsRugby | #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/TGkgHmnghd The bookmakers have Ireland as 25-point favourites on the handicap for today’s game and offer Wales at 14/1 against on a straight bet, which is long, long, long odds in a two-horse race to mix sporting metaphors. However, the Irish side would do well to remember that the tournament has had some famous upsets in the past, starting on the opening weekend on the first ever Six Nations in 2000. Scotland, the defending Fix Nations champions, travelled to the Stadio Flaminio in Rome to face an Italian side playing their first ever game in the Six Nations and lost 34-20. Italy’s, Argentine born outhalf, Diego Dominguez kicked 29-points. Wales beat raging hot favourites England 31-30 at Wembley in 1999 to deny them a Grand Slam. A late try by Scott Gibbs gave Wales the win and Scotland the title on points’ difference. In 2019 Ireland had just toppled world champions New Zealand in an unbeaten series of matches in November and sat on a run of 12 home wins on the bounce and 18 victories from their past 19 games. England, the visitors, hadn’t scored a try in Ireland in eight years, so it was no wonder that Joe Schmidt’s men down as heavy favourites on the day. England, under Eddie Jones, cruised home 32-20 for only their second win in Dublin since 2003. Italy enjoyed two huge upset wins in Rome, the first in 2011 when the squeezed-out France 22-21 with Mirco Bergamasco the hero, while two years later it was Ireland that suffered a similar fate losing 22-15 in the last game of Declan Kidney’s tenure as head coach. When Scotland beat England 11-6 at Twickenham in 2021, they were 9/2 underdogs with their hosts 1/6 to win that match. England were the reigning champions and it was a first win for the Scots in 38 years at the London venue. Good news and bad news today. Bad news is I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Good news is… I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🤣 Come on boys 💪🙏🏉 #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/Gpy9NIL9am Hello and welcome to the Irish Times blog for today’s Six Nations match at the Principality stadium. John O’Sullivan here and I’ll be taking you through the afternoon, before, during and after the game. We have some exclusive content too, not just what’s been on the website or in the newspaper. Will Wales get the big game bounce under new management with Cardiff coach Matt Sherratt taking over in an interim capacity following Warren Gatland’s departure, a decision based on mutual agreement between the New Zealander and the Welsh Rugby Union? The home supporters will be hoping that’s a fervent, ‘yes.’ Ireland are also under an interim coach, albeit in happier circumstances, in Simon Easterby, who is caretaking while Andy Farrell devotes himself to the British & Irish Lions head coach’s role. Not sure, when, if ever you would have had two countries facing one another in a Six Nations clash under interim head coaches. That’s not the only similarity. Wales and Ireland share a common identity prior to today’s match as the only two sides capable of winning the Triple Crown in this season’s Six Nations Championship. Ireland have safely negotiated two thirds of that remit with victories over England and Scotland, while for Wales this is the first leg of the treble with games against England and Scotland to come. Ireland take on Wales this afternoon as they look to keep their perfect start to this year’s Six Nations campaign going and claim the Triple Crown, although eyes are firmly set on the bigger prize with a third championship in a row and a grand slam within their sights. Simon Easterby has made seven changes to his side for the game with Dan Sheehan set to captain his country for the first time. Ireland come into the game as heavy favourites after the poor start Wales have had to the tournament and the departure of Warren Gatland.

Title: Here's what to know about Germany's election this Sunday
URL: https://www.npr.org/2025/02/22/g-s1-50098/germany-election-chancellor-parliament-afd

Rob Schmitz People walk past a truck with an election campaign poster featuring Friedrich Merz, leader of conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in Oberhausen, Germany, on Feb. 21. VOLKER HARTMANN/AFP via Getty Images hide caption BERLIN — An economic slump, an immigration crisis and the lifting of a security blanket provided for decades by its most powerful ally are on the minds of German voters as they head to the polls for Sunday's national parliamentary election. The general election of the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, was not supposed to come until September of this year. But on Nov. 6, just a day after American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term in office, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister after months of squabbling over how to revive Germany's struggling economy, leading to the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government and the call for a snap election. The latest polling data shows Scholz's Social Democrats in third place among voters (16%), behind the far-right Alternative for Germany or AfD Party (20%) and the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) alongside its Bavarian sister CSU party (29%). The CDU will likely emerge as the largest vote-getter and thus be in the position of forming a coalition government with one or two other parties. Since all of Germany's mainstream parties have vowed not to govern with the AfD, which is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany's democracy, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may have a difficult time forming a coalition government. "I'm just worried that after the election that it will take maybe two months for a coalition government to form," says Jana Puglierin, director of the Berlin office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "Once the coalition is in place, they need to draft a budget. And if we are very lucky, all of this will be done before the parliamentary summer break." The expected drawn-out German political timetable worries observers because of the next government's urgency to deal with multiple crises that face Europe's largest economy. These include an economic recession, a national debate over migration, and, perhaps most importantly, how to navigate a new global security order now that the Trump administration appears to be working with Russia to bring an end to Moscow's war in Ukraine without inviting Europe or Ukraine to the negotiating table. Whichever parties form the next coalition government in Berlin, Merz remains Scholz's likely successor. He is a 69-year-old conservative who hails from a family of lawyers. In addition to serving as a CDU member of parliament, Merz has also worked as a corporate lawyer and as a member of the supervisory board for the German branch of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world. Merz's longtime colleague Norbert Röttgen, who also serves as a CDU member of Germany's parliament, says Merz is a politician of conviction. Röttgen has known Merz for more than 30 years. The two entered parliament together and have worked side by side through successive governments. He says Merz has strong beliefs: "Societally conservative, traditional values and a strong, free-market conviction that liberal markets serve the people," says Röttgen. "And he is a fundamental pro-European trans-Atlanticist." Röttgen says Merz's convictions will prove useful as Germany is faced with difficult decisions after the United States has signaled changes in how it sees its European allies. The outgoing administration has not helped build a cohesive way forward for Europe on Ukraine, Puglierin says. "I think Merz, by disposition, would be more open to also support Ukraine more decisively," says Puglierin. "But he has to work in a framework. He will be constrained by his coalition partner and also by the German population." After coalition talks and tackling a budget that the Scholz administration left on the table, it might take months before Merz has the opportunity to put his mark on Germany, Puglierien says. Hints of how he will lead, though, have trickled out in recent weeks, as Merz got into trouble with his own party when he agreed to work with the AfD late last month to pass a motion that would have toughened up Germany's immigration policy. The motion failed after significant backlash against Merz for agreeing to work with a party seen by mainstream political parties as anti-democratic. Voter Ute Wolters, a 64-year-old architect from Lower Saxony, worries about Merz's potential leadership. "He claims to be up to the job, and we know he's a good businessman, but I worry he will go back on his promise to never enter into a coalition government with the AfD," she says, referring to repeated vows Merz has made throughout the campaign. Another voter, Ulrich Hinz, a 74-year-old retired businessman from Frankfurt, says he thinks Merz's pro-European outlook could help at such a trying time for Germany. "We need a chancellor and a government that is more European and one that can get along better with the French, Italians and the Poles," he says. "That's the only way we are going to be able to keep up with China, Russia, and the United States." Esme Nicholson contributed to this story from Berlin. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks about DeepSeek
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-thinks-deepseek-ai-q4-earnings-1851765905
Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:37:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA-2.20%) chief executive Jensen Huang doesn’t have hard feelings for Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. After the Hangzhou-based AI startup spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company — amid a global selloff of tech stocks. In December, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 of Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips to train its DeepSeek-V3 model — much less than the tens of thousands of more advanced Nvidia chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. The AI startup’s models, which it demonstrated to be on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META-2.72%), prompted questions over the tens of billions of dollars its U.S. rivals are spending on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. During an interview with DataDirect Networks chief executive Alex Bouzari, Huang said he thinks DeepSeek’s reasoning models, R1, which it released in January ahead of the stock rout, will lead to more demand for computing power, because reasoning is “fairly compute intensive.” “I think the market responded to R1 as in ‘Oh my gosh, AI is finished. It dropped out of the sky, we don’t need to do any computing anymore,’” Huang said. “It’s exactly the opposite.” Huang also noted that R1 is “the world’s first reasoning model that’s open-source,” meaning developers and consumers can freely use it. “It is so incredibly exciting, the energy around the world as a result of R1 becoming open-sourced. Incredible,” Huang said. Earlier this month, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM-2.47%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. Therefore, Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia is expected to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings next week.

Title: Travel Startups Raise $580 Million Over Two Weeks

Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:05:20Z

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else In the past two weeks, six travel startups have collectively raised $580 million, showcasing ongoing investor interest in travel technology advancements. Companies like Archer Aviation are leading the charge with significant funding aimed at developing flying taxis, with plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Klook and RoomPriceGenie are leveraging AI and automation to enhance travel experiences and hotel pricing, underscoring a shift towards modernizing traditional travel sectors. Tech companies promising to automate old industries are still getting big investment deals in 2025. Klook, which is modernizing the historically low-tech sector of ticketed experiences, just landed its second large fundraise in the past 18 months. And RoomPriceGenie, despite having several notable competitors, raised $75 million to help hotels automate pricing — an area that’s seen a lot of demand as hotels have been looking to modernize and generate more revenue since the pandemic. While startups developing flying taxis and renewable jet fuel are not producing much revenue yet, they’re raking in large amounts of money with the promise of big business in the future. Six travel startups raised nearly $580 million over the past two weeks. Archer Aviation, which is developing a flying taxi for commercial flights and defense clients, has raised $301.8 million. Investors included funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. The company has now raised over $2 billion, including its most recent deal of $430 million in December. The company said the latest fundraise brings its total liquidity to around $1 billion. California-based Archer is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft called Midnight. It is designed to hold a pilot with four passengers and luggage for urban trips of 20-50 miles at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. It is powered by six independent battery packs, each supporting a pair of electric engines, the company said. Archer said it now has manufacturing contracts worth over $6 billion. That includes a recent purchasing agreement for up to 100 aircrafts from Soracle — owned by Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation — which plans to operate a flying taxi service in various cities in Japan. The company recently unveiled plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles ahead of some major sporting events: the World Cup in 2026, the Super Bowl in 2027, and the Summer Olympics in 2028. The network includes vertiports (eVTOL airports) at Los Angeles International Airport, University of Southern California, Orange County, Santa Monica, Hollywood Burbank, Long Beach, and the Van Nuys neighborhood. The company is also planning to establish a vertiport near the SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles football teams Rams and Chargers. The plan is to begin LA network operations in 2026. This is in addition to plans for a network at California airports where Southwest Airlines operates, along with five vertiports in the Bay Area. The funding will go toward the continued development of the company’s aircraft. Klook, an online travel agency for tours and attractions, has raised $100 million The company said that the fundraise brings its valuation to over $1 billion for the first time. Vitruvian Partners led the round. The company last raised $210 million in equity and debt in 2023. Hong Kong-based Klook says it offers hundreds of thousands of ticketed experiences, such as walking tours, in 2,700 destinations globally. The company has also been expanding to offer hotels, trains, and car rentals. The new funding will go toward AI initiatives, such as for enhancing merchant operations, through an expanded partnership with Google Cloud. (See Skift’s story.) RoomPriceGenie, which provides AI-powered pricing tech for hotels, has raised $75 million. The funding comes from Five Elms Capital. Switzerland-based RoomPriceGenie provides a revenue management system for independent hotels and groups. The tech is meant to automate updating room rates based on changing market conditions. Competitors include Duetto, which was acquired by a private equity firm last year. The company says it has more than 3,000 hotel clients in 65 countries. The company also said it appointed Chas Scarantino as CEO. The co-founder and previous CEO, Ari Andricopoulos, is now the chief strategy officer. The funding will go toward expanding internally. Twelve, a renewable jet fuel production startup, has raised $83 million. Investors included DCVC, Amazon (The Climate Pledge Fund), Mitsui & Co., Development Bank of Japan, Japan Hydrogen Fund, Greycroft (Coca-Cola Sustainability Fund), 2551 Capital, SMBC, TPG, Pulse Fund, and others. The company most recently raised a series C round of $200 million in September. The new funding is a mix between an extension of the series C round plus financing to build a production facility. California-based Twelve says its tech generates jet fuel by converting a mix of carbon dioxide from either tanks or the atmosphere, along with water and renewable energy. Airline customers so far include Alaska Airlines and International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways. Superlogic, which helps users apply loyalty points to ticketed experiences, has raised $13.7 million in its series A funding. Superlogic, a trailblazer in experiential rewards technology, today announced a first closing of $13.7 million in its Series A funding round. Led by Powerledger led the round, with support from including Sangha Capital, 10SQ, Nima Capital, Actai Unicorn Fund, Hyla Liquid Venture Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Amex Ventures, Galaxy Interactive, Mirabaud Lifestyle Impact and Innovation, Recharge Capital, Dispersion Capital, Sanctor Capital, and more. Miami-based Superlogic provides an AI-powered platform that loyalty programs can use to connect users with experiences tailored to their interests. Spark e-Fuels, which is developing tech to make renewable jet fuel, has raised $2.4 million (€2.3 million) in pre-seed funding. Nucleus Capital led the round, with support from Zero Carbon Capital, IBB Ventures, Chemovator, Voyagers.io, 1.5° Ventures, and a group of angel investors. Spark is focused on building its first e-fuel pilot plant and expanding its team to accelerate technology development and commercialization. The Berlin-based startup is developing tech that converts renewable resources like carbon dioxide, into jet fuel. The funding will go toward building its first pilot production plant and hiring.

Title: Coinbase CEO’s Hot Take: Bitcoin Is Basically A ‘Meme Coin’
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/coinbase-ceos-hot-take-bitcoin-is-basically-a-meme-coin/
Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:00:16Z
Full Content:
Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, has recently made an audacious statement regarding Bitcoin that has caused quite a stir in the crypto industry. He recently proposed that Bitcoin could be regarded as “somewhat of a meme coin,” which sparked a debate among enthusiasts, analysts, and investors. Like meme currencies, Armstrong pointed out that the value of Bitcoin is essentially derived from popular or collective belief. He explained that unlike conventional assets, Bitcoin lacks inherent value connected with actual objects or direct use. Instead, its value is swayed by societal trust and the shared perception of its significance. He also likened Bitcoin to the US dollar, noting that although the dollar’s value has persisted mostly due to mass acceptance and faith in its purchasing power, and it is not connected to the gold standard. This comparison highlights Bitcoin’s status as a store of value rather than a commodity with inherent worth. Armstrong did not intend to undermine Bitcoin’s credibility; however, his statements underscored the expanding influence of meme coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two cryptocurrencies that have amassed substantial followings despite possessing minimal fundamental utility. On memecoins… Memecoins have generated a lot of buzz recently, and I’ve gotten some questions on how I think about them. I am personally not a memecoin trader (beyond a few test trades), but they’ve become hugely popular. Arguably, they’ve been with us since the beginning –… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 19, 2025 For example, Dogecoin, which originated as a joke, experienced a price increase of over 15,000% in 2021 as a result of social media publicity and endorsements from prominent figures such as Elon Musk. Shiba Inu reached an all-time market cap of around $40 billion. This trend is a reflection of how sentiment and viral appeal can push asset valuation up, much like what Armstrong suggests applies to Bitcoin. Armstrong agreed that, in spite of the comparison, Bitcoin is still the most well-known cryptocurrency. The crypto continues to dominate institutional adoption, regulatory discussions, and long-term investment strategies. Meanwhile, the legitimacy of Bitcoin has been strengthened even more by the trust big financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have in the crypto asset. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and decentralized nature also sets it apart from the typical meme coin phenomenon. Armstrong’s statement has fueled discussions about how cryptocurrencies derive their value. Some critics argue that equating Bitcoin to a meme coin undermines its role as “digital gold,” while others believe it accurately describes the evolving nature of financial assets in the internet era.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Target is facing another big DEI lawsuit

Time Published: 2025-02-21T19:44:00Z
Full Content:
Target (TGT+0.86%) was hit with another lawsuit on Thursday, this time by the state of Florida, which accused the retail giant of hiding the risks tied to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The state claims these initiatives sparked a customer backlash that erased billions of dollars from Target’s market value. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fort Myers, Florida, was brought by the State Board of Administration of Florida, an agency responsible for managing public pension funds, which hold Target stock. Florida alleges that Target misled investors and alienated its core customer base by making false and misleading statements in its financial reports about its DEI and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. The lawsuit also targets Target CEO Brian Cornell, accusing him of downplaying the scope of customer boycotts following the company’s Pride Month campaign in May 2023. The state claims these boycotts contributed to a prolonged decline in Target’s share price. Target did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit is being represented by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and America First Legal, a group led by President Donald Trump’s advisor, Stephen Miller. “Corporations that push radical leftist ideology at the expense of financial returns jeopardize the retirement security of Florida’s first responders and teachers,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “My office will stridently pursue corporate reform so that companies get back to the business of doing business — not offensive political theatre.” This is America First Legal’s second lawsuit against Target. Earlier this month, the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida filed a similar lawsuit. The legal actions come as Target, along with other major corporations such as Walmart (WMT+3.62%), McDonald’s (MCD+0.86%), and Meta (META-2.72%), have recently scaled back their DEI initiatives.

Title: Jensen Huang Donates a Lifeline to San Francisco’s Last Nonprofit Arts College

Time Published: 2025-02-21T19:37:16Z

David Howse, president of the California College of the Arts (CCA), delivered grim news last summer to his faculty and students: given rapidly declining enrollment, the college’s future was in serious peril. Less than a year later, the nonprofit arts college has received a lifeline thanks to the philanthropy of Nvidia (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The Jen-Hsun (Jensen Huang’s Chinese name) and Lori Huang Foundation, founded by Huang and his wife nearly two decades ago, is donating a staggering $22.5 million to the San Francisco-based school—the largest gift in its history. The donation matches additional funds raised from other individuals and entities connected to either the college or local arts and tech communities, giving the CCA a total of nearly $45 million to address its financial struggles. Huang’s foundation “saw an opportunity both to support CCA in this time of need and also to challenge others to rise to the moment,” said Howse in a statement. Like other nonprofit arts colleges across the U.S., CCA has faced mounting challenges in recent years amid a dramatic drop-off in enrollment exacerbated by demographic factors and the Covid-19 pandemic. In August, the school announced a series of cost-cutting measures, such as layoffs, as it faced a $20 million deficit. Besides addressing its deficit, CCA said its new funds will be earmarked for program launches and future fundraising opportunities. The school was founded more than a century ago and focuses primarily on art, architecture, design and writing; offering 22 undergraduate and 10 graduate programs. Huang is currently the world’s 11th richest person with an estimated net worth of $121.8 billion—an achievement enabled largely by Nvidia’s dominance in today’s A.I. boom. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become a rare commodity amongst tech developers scrambling to power their A.I. products, with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL) pouring billions of dollars into Nvidia’s sought-after hardware. While the bulk of the Huang Foundation’s donations have been funneled into donor-advised funds, a type of philanthropic savings account utilized by the wealthy, the nonprofit has also supported a number of educational institutions over the years. In 2023, for example, it gave $10 million to Oregon State University (OSU), which both Huang and his wife Lori attended. The couple previously pledged $50 million to their alma mater in 2022 to build a supercomputing complex. And in 2008, they gave $30 million to help establish an engineering center at Stanford, where Huang received a degree in electrical engineering back in 1992. The billionaire’s donations have additionally benefited the Oneida Baptist Institute, a Kentucky boarding school he attended that received $2 million from Huang in 2019. While CCA isn’t one of the Nvidia founder’s alma maters, the art school’s alumni are well-connected across Silicon Valley. Graduates are frequently pursued by the likes of Google and Apple (AAPL), according to the school. Huang’s foundation “recognizes the essential intersection of technology, art and design in driving innovation,” said Eric Jensen, chief operating officer of the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation, in a statement. “Our investment in CCA reflects our commitment to supporting institutions that cultivate the creative leaders of tomorrow.” Huang isn’t the only tech billionaire injecting capital into arts education across Silicon Valley. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, led a nonprofit’s acquisition of the San Francisco Art Institute last year. The school, which will now house an artist residency program, went bankrupt in 2023—making CCA San Francisco’s last standing nonprofit arts college.

Title: The Ozempic shortage is over
URL: https://qz.com/fda-ozempic-wegovy-shortage-resolved-1851765844
Time Published: 2025-02-21T18:18:00Z
Full Content:
The shortage of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.10%) blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs is officially over, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Friday, marking the shortage of semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — as resolved. The news puts pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, also known as compounded versions, of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs due to widespread shortages. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring sales for these treatments have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+2.11%), the maker of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, Skyrocketing demand and the drugs’ high list price has made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Semaglutide had been listed on the FDA shortage list since March 2022. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.” Novo Nordisk stock jumped over 4% on Friday. The millennial-focused telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS-26.53%), which began offering a compounded version of semaglutide last May, saw its stock drop by over 22% during Friday’s trading session. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand name weight-loss drugs has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. “Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum said in a statement. “We’re also closely monitoring potential future shortages, as Novo Nordisk stated two weeks ago that it would continue to have ‘capacity limitations’ and ‘expected continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications.’” In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions. The FDA said on Friday that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. However, the FDA’s decision will likely face challenges from compounders, who have already sued the agency over its decision to declare a shortage of another weight-loss drug as resolved. The FDA originally declared the shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound — over in October. However, an industry group, the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA), filed a lawsuit in Texas against the agency just days later, challenging its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary,” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” The FDA said, in a court filing, that pharmacists could temporarily resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision In a December letter, the agency stated that its review found Eli Lilly has sufficient supply to meet and exceed both current and future demand for the drugs. As a result, it set deadlines for compounding pharmacies — Feb. 18 for 503As and Mar. 19 for 503B’s — to stop selling off-brand versions of tirzepatide.

Title: The best trade in the market might be following everything Elon Musk touches
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/best-trade-biggest-returns-might-musk-trade-not-trump-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-21T14:18:29Z
Full Content:
Happy Friday! Ever wondered what goes on at those massive real-estate conferences for people looking to grow (or start) their real-estate empire? Business Insider's Kathleen Elkins spent a day at one, and the biggest takeaway had nothing to do with the actual housing market. In today's big story, forget the Trump trade. The biggest returns might be on the Musk trade. Markets: PE would like to be a big part of your 401(k), but it might need some help from President Trump. Tech: As talk of data center regulation ramps up, Big Tech is turning to the lobbyists. Business: IRS probationary employees are next on the chopping block. But first, Musk is having a moment. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the best investing strategies these days? Trust in Musk. In the lead-up to the election, investors piled into assets they thought would benefit from Donald Trump's return to the White House in what was known as the Trump trade. But it's Musk-affiliated assets that have really shined since Donald Trump's November victory, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. From Tesla to X to dogecoin, if Musk is close to it, it's likely been up big since November. (That's also benefited the man himself. His net worth is reportedly up about $135 billion since the election.) You could argue the Musk trade is just the ultimate Trump trade. (Now we're really getting meta.) After all, one of the main reasons everything Musk touches is skyrocketing is thanks to his proximity to Trump. But even among executives who have tried to ingratiate themselves with Trump, Musk stands apart. Take Meta, where Mark Zuckerberg has overhauled the tech giant in what appears to be a bid to align it with the new administration. The company is up more than 20% since Trump's victory, good for second-best among the all-important Magnificent 7. The top spot? Musk's Tesla, which is up more than 40% during the same time period. Banking on your relationship with a political figure known for unpredictability comes with risks. While the Trump relationship has suited Musk well thus far, the president's opinion of people, even those in his administration, can change quickly. There have been signs of small cracks in the Trump-Musk foundation. Musk essentially killing a government funding bill last December led some Democrats to question whether he was the GOP's real leader. That chatter elicited a forceful pushback from a Trump spokeswoman. A few weeks later Musk clashed with Trump's base over the future of H-1B visas. (Trump eventually sided with Musk.) More recently, Trump said Musk opening a Tesla plant in India, another target of his expansive tariff plans and a key future market for Tesla, would be "unfair" to the US. Musk's businesses will also eventually need to address big questions about their future. Tesla, for example, is seeing increased competition from Chinese EVs looking to expand beyond their home country. And for all the wins X has notched recently, some experts have pointed to its relationship with Musk's buzzy AI startup, xAI, as what's reigniting investors' interest in the platform. In the meantime, Musk's companies might be happy to point out their owner's powerful relationship when it benefits them. BI's Peter Kafka wrote about a Wall Street Journal report that Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, and her lieutenants have been pressing one of the world's biggest ad agencies to get its clients to spend more money on X by using an implied threat of government interference. 1. Your 401(k) could look a lot different if private equity gets its wish. In June 2020, President Trump opened the door for alternative assets in 401(k) investing. Five years later, virtually no one has taken up the opportunity. The reason: litigation risk. BI spoke with multiple industry insiders and experts to understand what these private-equity firms want — and what it could mean for the average investor's retirement plans. 2. Big-box retail stocks take a tumble. Despite Walmart's earnings beat on Wednesday, the retail giant's full-year outlook disappointed. The guidance had a ripple effect, triggering concerns about a consumer spending slowdown as other retailers — like Target, Costco, and Kroger — saw shares slip on Thursday. 3. Investors got the DeepSeek stock sell-off wrong. That's according to Jensen Huang, CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, which was hit by the dramatic market response to DeepSeek's release of a new model built with less advanced chips. Speaking at a virtual event that aired Thursday, Huang said investors misinterpreted DeepSeek's advancements. He said that the AI industry still needs computing power for post-training methods. 1. Meta approves bonuses of up to 200% of company executives' salaries. The company said the bonus plan provides "variable cash incentives" designed to "motivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements," per a SEC filing. 2. A glimpse inside Elon Musk's new Atlanta data center. xAI is joining forces with X to operate a large data center, its second facility after Musk's Memphis project. BI reviewed an agreement with a local economic development agency and found the center will house about 12,000 Nvidia chips. Earlier agreements indicate the center will hold equipment totaling $700 million. It shows how Musk is pooling resources between his AI startup and X to benefit both companies. 3. Big Tech's latest lobbying push. A PAC tied to The Data Center Coalition — which counts Amazon, Google, and Microsoft as members — contributed $165,500 to Virginia lawmakers. The contributions mark the group's first political donations and came in the months leading up to the state's annual legislative session. The donations might have paid off, as a slate of bipartisan data center regulation failed to get approval. 1. The IRS has begun firing probationary workers. It's the latest agency to be hit with layoffs. The firings also come amid tax-filing season and could specifically hit jobs responsible for enforcement and tax evasion. 2. 007 enters a new era. Amazon MGM Studios announced it is taking creative control over the James Bond franchise as longtime producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli step back from decision-making. With the franchise in new hands, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos asked the question we're all dying to know: "Who'd you pick as the next Bond?" 3. Charlie Javice is she-who-shall-not-be-named at Quinn Emanuel. In an email viewed by BI, Javice's legal team told lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan not to discuss the startup founder's criminal fraud trial around the office — lest Javice overhears them. Javice is on trial in Manhattan for fraud, alongside executive Olivier Amar, after selling her college financial aid startup Frank to JPMorgan.

Marlow/Saslove & Warwick at Douglas Elliman Real Estate) That Aspen is Colorado’s ritziest housing market has long been a given and last year was no exception — Pitkin County claimed nine out of the 10 most expensive home sales in the state. But a sale that broke the $100 million threshold for the first time in state history helped the town dominate the charts nationally.The second quarter of 2024 was especially notable, with half of the 10 most expensive home sales recorded in the country happening in Aspen, according to real estate brokerage Redfin. For the year, Colorado claimed three of the top 10 sales where a public record was available.“When I moved to Aspen 30 years ago, we were a town of millionaires, not billionaires. Now we are a town of billionaires,” said Brenda Wild, an owner broker with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices in Aspen.Casino mogul Steve Wynn, founder of The Bellagio in Las Vegas, and online stock trading pioneer Thomas Petterfy, teamed up to purchase 419 Willoughby Way in Aspen for $108 million on April 15. The home, the largest on the top 10 list at a commanding 22,405 square feet, is on a street that has earned the title of Colorado’s billionaire row.The property at 720 Willoughby Way in Aspen, Colorado, sold for $60 million in 2024. (Provided by Mandy Welgos)In the neighborhood was the state’s fourth most expensive sale last year at $60 million — 720 Willoughby Way. Four years earlier that same home had sold for $27 million, a common acceleration in value among the top-priced sellers.The desire to get away and claim more space during the pandemic contributed to a run-up in prices in several resort areas. Pitkin County added to the frenzy when it limited the size of new homes to 9,250 square feet, helping make the mega-mansions built in prior decades collectibles for the rich and famous.Wild said the uber-wealthy view Aspen real estate as an asset class where they can park their money and earn a steady return. The location offers a getaway where they can isolate and disappear off the grid if they want or rub shoulders with other shakers and movers on the slopes or at different festivals.“Aspen has the full package and people are coming from all over the world, all the time,” she said. Measured on a per-square-foot basis, the most expensive home on the list was 850 Roaring Fork Road. It went for $7,901 a square foot, which compares to $4,820 a square foot for 419 Willoughby.Outside of Aspen, only Vail managed to sneak a home onto the state’s top 10 list. That was the $40 million sale of 107 Rockledge Road, a 12,447-square-foot property that looks down on Vail Village and has direct access to the slopes.“It was the highest sales price for a single-family home that we have ever had,” said Liz Leeds, who specializes in luxury home sales in both Aspen and Vail. “Vail commands high prices, but not at the same level as what Aspen is doing.” Vail falls more in the price range of corporate executives and high-paid professionals who can’t afford Aspen, Leeds said.

Title: Shake Shack's CEO said the cost of eggs will likely drive up demand for beef and chicken

Time Published: 2025-02-21T10:43:48Z
Full Content:
Shake Shack's CEO, Rob Lynch, says food chains will likely introduce more chicken and beef menu items as the price of eggs soars. On the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Lynch discussed the impact of tariffs and imports on the burger chain's business. Lynch said the company sources the majority of its ingredients domestically and won't have major exposure to tariffs. Thanks to its menu, it is largely insulated from the skyrocketing price of eggs as well. "I mean we don't have a breakfast business, a big breakfast business. So we don't have the exposure to eggs," Lynch said. "But other restaurant companies that have exposure to eggs may be moving away from eggs in the time being, which means they are going to offer more beef products or chicken products to complement, to substitute for that high-cost item," he said. Shake Shack is known for its beef, chicken, and mushroom burgers, as well as its fries and frozen custard shakes. While eggs don't play heavily into its menu, fast food giants from Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell to McDonald's and Burger King rely on eggs for some of their popular breakfast menu items. Lynch's comments come as egg prices in the US soar. Prices increased by 15.2% from December to January, the largest monthly spike in 10 years. In January, the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs in the country hit an all-time high of $4.95. The surge was caused due to supply chain issues stemming from a H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the US. The flu has forced farmers to cull infected birds, leading to egg shortages. Chains like Costco have seen egg cartons fly off their shelves minutes after store openings. Grocery stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Costco have imposed limits on the number of cartons each customer can purchase. Earlier this month, Waffle House started adding a 50-cent surcharge to each egg it sells. Shake Shack, which started as a hot dog kiosk in New York City's Madison Square Park in 2004, has over 570 locations worldwide, including more than 370 outlets in the US. The chain posted a total quarterly revenue of $329 million, up 14.8% from the same quarter in 2023. This included $317 million of company-operated sales and about $12 million from licensing revenue. The company's stock was up 11% at market close on Thursday. It's up more than 27% in the past year. Representatives for Shake Shack did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Title: Cameo is giving workers a $10,000 raise to return to the office. Its CEO says they're paying more because they're asking for more.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/cameo-ceo-raise-return-to-office-increased-productivity-new-applicants-2025-2

The celebrity video messaging company Cameo this week rolled out $10,000 raises for employees returning to work in-office four days a week at its Chicago headquarters. CEO Steven Galanis told Business Insider the raises and other perks announced this week — such as catered lunch, paid parking, and a free gym membership — have immediately boosted productivity and recruitment efforts. Chicago-based workers all attended the first four required days in office without absences, they completed more sales outreach together in just a few days than they had in the previous six months, and the move has helped them recruit new employees, he said. "It's been pretty amazing to watch the reception that we've seen from applicants," Galanis said. "People are coming out of the woodwork that want to work for us now, and ex-employees want to come back, which is awesome." Cameo, which has gone through three rounds of highly publicized and contentious layoffs since the COVID-19 pandemic, now employs 50 people, with about half living in the Chicago area, Galanis said. Those who don't live within commuting distance of Chicago aren't eligible for the raise unless they move there, and will not be required to report to the office, he said. If Cameo sets up satellite locations in other cities in the future, Galanis said the option for an in-office work raise would apply to them, as well. Galanis said he believes the company thrives on in-office brainstorming and participation, but he wanted to try to lure his workers back into the company headquarters organically. "We really wanted this to be a FOMO-inducing perk versus a punishment," Galanis said."I believe if we're requiring you to come in four days a week, we are literally asking more out of you than if you didn't have to. So, to me, if we're asking more out of you, it totally makes sense that we should pay you more." The $10,000 raise stands in contrast to other companies' RTO mandates, though Galanis said he has a preference for in-office collaboration shared by many top executives. JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon, last week made headlines for a viral, expletive-laden rant against working from home. In it, he said he didn't care how many of the banking giant's employees signed a petition against its five-day return-to-office mandate that takes effect next month. "Don't waste time on it," Dimon said. "I don't care how many people sign that f—ing petition." Other major companies, such as Starbucks, have threatened employees with termination if they refuse to comply with RTO orders, Bloomberg first reported in October. Still, some major return-to-office rollouts have been bumpy. As Business Insider previously reported, Amazon delayed its RTO initiative for some employees because it didn't have enough workspace for returning employees. Galanis said he understands the vitriol over working from home espoused by some executives — "what Jamie said is something that myself and many other CEOs have felt before or talked about behind closed doors," he said — and he gets the need for some extra large companies to be more strict in their approach to returning to the office. That just wasn't for him, he said. "I can't judge what's the right thing for another company's culture," Galanis said. "But I know the way our company is, and I know how much we cherish our employees and so this, for us, was the right approach." Jump to

February 20, 2025 20:30 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Travel Back in Time to 2009… and Buy Tech

By Adam Sharp PostedFebruary 20, 2025 In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, I was obsessed with the risk of a “double-dip” recession. The outlook was bleak. The banks all seemed to be failing, stocks had crashed, housing was belly-up, and the Fed was printing money like mad. So instead of gobbling up cheap tech shares, I was primarily focused on hoarding my (meager) stash of precious metals and preparing for an armageddon which never came. The gold and silver investments worked out fine, and I’m extremely bullish on gold and silver going forward. But let’s be honest. I would have been better off if I had diversified and bought fast-growing U.S. tech companies at huge discounts. For example, in January of 2009 Amazon (AMZN) shares traded as low as $2.38 (split-adjusted). Today it trades at $222, nearly 100x higher. That opportunity has passed. But what if there was a similar setup to the Nasdaq in 2009 available today? I think I’ve found it. But be forewarned, some of you are going to hate it. I’ve been reluctant to write about it for a while now, but simply can’t hold it in any longer. It’s… Chinese tech. Over the past few years, China’s massive real estate bubble has popped. Our own Jim Rickards nailed this event, writing in July of 2021 that China was a Fragile Giant. China also confronts an insolvent banking system and a real estate bubble. Up to half of China’s investment is a complete waste. It does produce jobs and utilize inputs like cement, steel, copper and glass. But the finished product, whether a city, train station or sports arena, is often a white elephant that will remain unused. The Chinese landscape is littered with “ghost cities” that have resulted from China’s wasted investment and flawed development model. It was an incredible call by Jim. In the years following that article, the KraneShares China Internet ETF (KWEB) crashed 80% from its all-time high. KWEB is China’s equivalent to the Nasdaq 100. So this was China’s version of America’s 2008 bubble crash, on steroids. Fast forward to today, however, and I believe the bottom is finally in for Chinese tech firms. KWEB still trades about 66% below its all-time high. Here’s a 5 year KWEB chart: As you can see, China’s tech sector is still far below all-time highs. If this is the beginning of a new bull market, it’s still quite early. Importantly, today DeepSeek has changed the narrative around Chinese technology. Whether we like it or not, they’re making major progress in areas such as AI, nuclear, fusion, electric vehicles, phones, satellites, semiconductors, and even planes. There are certainly problems in China, such as overcapacity and ruthless competition eroding profit margins. And needless to say, the communist government structure isn’t ideal for tech firms. Nevertheless, China’s tech sector is cheap, hated, and in an uptrend. That is typically a recipe for gains. This morning Alibaba (BABA) beat earnings and jumped more than 10% in early trading. As I write this it’s still up around 7% at midday. Alibaba is the “Amazon of China”. It’s the country’s largest online retailer, and the largest cloud computing provider (just like Amazon). You could also call the company the “Paypal of China”, due to its 33% stake in Ant Group, which owns the all-encompassing Alipay payment app (think Paypal meets Visa). Alibaba is also one of the top 3 AI companies in China, and its leading AI model, Qwen Max 2.5, is competitive with ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Google’s top models. Alibaba has soared 80% over the past year. But it has huge amounts of room to run to get back to all-time highs. Here’s a 5-year chart of BABA: So… why did Alibaba shares crash, anyways? The first factor was the real estate bubble popping, which we covered above. But there’s more to the story. Back in 2021 and 2022, Alibaba was dominating in China a little too much. President Xi and the CCP didn’t like that. Alibaba’s subsidiary Ant Group was making big moves in the financial space, threatening to cut in on state-owned banks and other financial businesses. So the Chinese government laid the smack down on Alibaba, issuing huge fines and cancelling the IPO of Ant Group (Alipay). This is a real risk of investing in China. The government has too much power over business matters. But I think that risk has mostly passed. Today Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma have paid their fines, and their dues. A meeting with President Xi this week sealed the deal. Jack Ma and BABA are suddenly back in polite society. President Xi and the government have signaled support for the private sector, and are stimulating the economy with QE and cheap loans (as we did in 2009). To be clear, I don’t think Alibaba will deliver 100x returns from here. It’s already too large for those types of gains. But I think it still has a very nice run ahead of it. The Ant Group (Alipay) IPO could happen in the near future, which would be a major catalyst for the stock. In full transparency, over the past 7 months I’ve been buying Alibaba (BABA), Xiaomi (XIACY), and BYD (BYDDY). These are some of China’s hottest tech firms. I also recently added a China small-cap ETF (ECNS) and PGJ (China internet ETF). I plan to hold these positions for at least five years, if not longer. This week President Trump posted the following message on his Truth Social platform. Source: Truth Social Some of you may be surprised by President Trump’s friendly tone here. I am not. We need to make a trade deal with China, and soon, as we discussed last month. It’s in both countries’ interests. If a trade deal with China does go through, that should throw gas on the fire beneath Chinese tech stocks. Uncertainty around trade wars and tariffs has been a major factor holding back the sector. Overall I strongly believe the global trade wars are just beginning, but we may see some progress soon on the China front. To conclude, I believe the setup in Chinese tech today is quite similar to the Nasdaq in 2009. I may be wrong, but am willing to take that chance given the potential upside. It’s not very often we get a chance to buy fast-growing tech at a 66% discount. I’m not going to miss the opportunity this time, even if it means investing in a communist country. If some of you can’t stomach that, however, I completely understand. It’s not the hand I would’ve chosen, but it is the one we’ve been dealt. I believe China’s tech sector is in for a lucrative bull market ahead. Phew, it feels good to have that off my chest. Disclosure: Of the companies and funds mentioned in this article, the author owns Alibaba, Xiaomi, BYD, PGJ, and ECNS.

Title: Satya Nadella Unveils Microsoft’s Quantum Breakthrough: a New State of Matter

For a field that many have long considered decades away, quantum computing sure is getting a lot of buzz in Silicon Valley. Yesterday (Feb. 19), Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled a quantum chip known as Majorana 1, created with an entirely new state of matter that’s beyond solid, liquid and gas. “Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a post on X yesterday. “We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.” Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. While traditional computing currently relies on bits, quantum computing utilizes qubits—a unit of information that can operate in multiple states simultaneously, instead of being either on or off. To build qubits, most quantum companies use superconducting units. But for decades, Microsoft has taken a notably unique approach. Majorana 1 contains eight qubits created with a new state of matter the company calls a “topological state,” a feat achieved by combining both semiconductors and superconductors. These topological qubits are “faster, more reliable and smaller,” providing a clearer path to eventually fitting a million qubits on a single chip, according to Nadella. Researchers have spent decades studying the feasibility of a so-called quantum computer, which could tackle calculations beyond the wildest capabilities of today’s supercomputers. Quantum computing is still a way off from becoming commercially viable, but recent research progress has heated up the tech industry’s race to develop quantum computers—a milestone that could have major implications for everything from the health care industry to supply chains and climate change. A one-million-qubit quantum computer is largely considered the threshold for delivering real-world results, Microsoft said. Due to their ability to draw from quantum mechanics, such machines could solve problems across chemistry and materials science that are impossible with current computing capabilities. Potential results could include discovering why materials crack, a breakthrough that could lead to self-healing materials; or creating a way to break down all types of plastic. “Most of all, quantum computing could allow engineers, scientists, companies and others to simply design things right the first time,” Microsoft said. Microsoft isn’t the only Big Tech company attempting to crack the quantum computing. Decades of research from companies like IBM, Intel and Google (GOOGL) has seemingly begun to pay off. Most recently, Google sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley when it unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow. In less than five minutes, the computer was able to perform a standard benchmark computation that would take today’s supercomputers 10 septillion years—a number that surpasses the age of the universe—to complete. But not everyone is convinced that true breakthroughs are just around the corner. Tech leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang have raised red flags about the technology’s timeline. In January, Huang sent quantum stocks tumbling after declaring that “very useful quantum computers are still a few decades away.” Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed these concerns a few days later while speaking on Joe Rogan’s podcast. “My understanding is that’s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,” Zuckerberg said. Nadella is more optimistic. Microsoft’s new advancements mean the company could be the first to achieve milestones like a one-million-qubit chip and thousands of error-corrected qubits, said the CEO during an episode of the Dwarkesh Podcast yesterday. “And then it’s game on. You suddenly have the ability to build a real utility-scale quantum computer,” he said. While it’s under Nadella’s leadership that Microsoft is finally edging closer to reaping the rewards of such research, its quantum computing strategy started back in the 2000s—long before Nadella joined the company. “It’s unbelievable,” Nadella said of the effort, which has taken place under previous chief executives like Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. “I’m the third CEO of Microsoft who’s been excited about quantum.” Despite the long waits they generate, such projects are key to the success of Microsoft’s research division, according to Nadella. “We’ve got to go at it each year knowing that most of these bets are not going to pay off in any finite frame,” he said. “Maybe the sixth CEO of Microsoft will benefit from it.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) vowed this month that a stablecoin bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, will be passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law within the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s administration. As the bill gains momentum, some experts say the industry may be at a crossroads. While the measure would for the first time provide a pathway to legality for stablecoin giants like Tether and Circle, it would also likely unleash massive competition. A federal framework would embolden countless companies to dive into the $233 billion stablecoin market, according to Niklas Kunkel, the founder of blockchain oracle builder Chronicle Labs. At the least, many firms will consider what strategic advantages stablecoins have, he told Decrypt. “As soon as this legislation passes, there are going to be 10,000 companies looking at this,” Kunkel said. “I would expand that beyond just payment companies and asset issuers. [...] You can include tech companies: the Amazons, Ubers, Metas and Googles of the world." Among interested firms, Kunkel bet 1,000 of them would debut a stablecoin within the following year that stablecoin legislation is passed. In lieu of adopting an existing stablecoin like Circle’s USDC, however, Kunkel said firms will be incentivized to release their own equivalent. “They would love their users to use their own branded stablecoin because they can make the yield on the underlying reserves,” he explained. “They may even be white-labeled.” As an example of a white-labeled stablecoin, Kunkel pointed to Paxos. The company once issued a Binance-branded stablecoin called BUSD, while playing a central role in PayPal’s stablecoin foray as the issuer of PayPal USD (PYUSD). As digital assets are pegged to the price of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are often backed by reserves of cash and U.S. Treasuries that generate yield. In Coinbase’s fourth quarter, the company disclosed $224 million in revenue from assets backing USDC. A report published by S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday found that the GENIUS Act would increase the adoption of stablecoins in the U.S. The lack of regulation in the U.S. is “one of the main impediments” to broader adoption, the analysts wrote. In November, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla wrote in a letter addressed to Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris—then the Democratic presidential candidate—that America’s opportunity to cement financial dominance through stablecoins had been stifled so far by “countless examples of regulatory overreach.” Though firms like BlackRock have issued tokenized money market funds that resemble stablecoins, S&P analysts wrote that a lack of regulation and supervision has prevented their broader adoption in fields like everyday payments. Chronicle Labs is developing a network for oracles, which allow blockchains to connect with external, real-word data sources. Before starting the Switzerland-based firm, Kunkel worked for five years at MakerDAO, the popular lending protocol behind the stablecoin DAI. (MakerDAO has since rebranded to Sky and replaced DAI with USDS.) Kunkel was part of the founding team at MakerDAO when the organization launched in 2017. And at this point, building something that resembles a bank and operates solely on stablecoin rails is possible, he said. The regulatory backdrop just needs to catch up. “As soon as you get the government involved, everything slows down to a crawl,” he said. “The rate at which that iceberg thaws is going to determine how far into the future that we have to look before we realize this.” When PayPal introduced its stablecoin in 2023, the firm faced criticism from Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a top Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. She said that “federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential,” expressing deep concern that the payments giant had moved before a framework was passed. Ultimately, stablecoin legislation may further intertwine the U.S. financial system with crypto’s sprawling decentralized finance, or DeFi, landscape, according to S&P analysis. “In our view, the role of stablecoins will continue to evolve and could eventually lead to more integration between traditional finance and decentralized finance,” they wrote.

Title: Tech’s Revolving Door of Layoffs Shatters Worker Trust
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/techs-revolving-door-of-layoffs-shatters-worker-trust/
Time Published: 2025-02-20T18:15:38Z

Once a beacon of stability and lavish perks, the tech industry is now a minefield of layoffs, leaving workers disillusioned and employers scrambling to retain talent. In the past week, Meta Platforms Inc., Workday Inc., and OpenText Corp. joined a parade of firms cutting thousands of jobs—over 6,500 since February 13—adding to a 2025 toll exceeding 10,800. Repeated downsizings, often paired with soaring profits, have “severed trust” between tech workers and their bosses, as employees question the loyalty once taken for granted in Silicon Valley. The latest salvo began February 10, when Meta axed 3,600 jobs—5% of its workforce—targeting “low performers,” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s memo, reported by Bloomberg. Workday followed on February 12, slashing 1,750 roles to fund AI initiatives, while OpenText cut 1,200 on February 13 to trim costs. Alphabet Inc.’s Google offered voluntary exits in its Platforms & Devices unit, and Microsoft Corp., Salesforce Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. pruned staff across divisions, from underperformers to sustainability teams. Salesforce’s over-1,000 cuts came even as it hires for AI roles, per company statements. This isn’t a one-off. Meta’s latest purge follows a December 2024 cut of 5%, part of a 24,000-job reduction since 2022. Amazon aims to shed 14,000 managerial roles by spring, and Intel Corp.’s 15,000 layoffs last year remain a stark benchmark. On X, @JimJeffery11 dubbed it “private-sector ruthlessness,” a sentiment echoing through posts as workers lament the shift from tech’s cushy past. The erosion stems from a toxic mix of broken promises and cold pragmatism. Tech workers, lured by free meals and stock options, once saw their employers as partners in a grand mission. Now, they’re expendable. “I don’t trust employers anymore,” Eliot Lee, a 52-year-old project manager laid off multiple times, told The Washington Post last week. His story resonates: despite glowing reviews, workers at Meta and elsewhere find themselves blindsided, venting on X about “sudden betrayals.” Profits only deepen the rift. Meta’s stock rose 3% post-layoffs, and Microsoft boasts a $3 trillion valuation, yet cuts persist. X user @CPA_jjones on February 19 framed it as “remixing staff for efficiency,” not necessity—a view bolstered by a World Economic Forum survey predicting 41% of firms will shrink workforces due to AI within five years. Companies tout AI and cost-cutting, but employees see greed. “They’re thriving, yet we’re disposable,” tweeted @gamefrenza on February 15. Transparency—or its absence—fuels the fire. Google’s voluntary exits and Meta’s performance purges lack the decorum of past “restructurings,” as @gkcs_ noted on X. Workers feel like cogs in a machine, a far cry from the “family” rhetoric of the 2010s. The fallout is palpable. A Washington Post report on February 10 cited studies showing repeated layoffs erode morale, stifle innovation, and push survivors to disengage. Meta staffers, some axed despite high ratings, flooded social media with disbelief, per posts tracked this week. “Trust is gone,” one anonymous employee wrote on X, echoing a broader sentiment: 60% of laid-off techies distrust future employers, per a 2023 Tech.co survey still relevant today. The job market offers little solace. While IT and finance hiring ticks up, per @CPA_jjones, competition is fierce—over 1,000 applicants vie for single roles, Lee noted. Daelynn Moyer, 55, laid off from Indeed last year, has applied to 140 jobs without success, contemplating a farming pivot, per the Post. Visa holders like Chicago-based engineer Mittal face deportation if unhired within 60 days, adding urgency to the chaos, per CNBC. Companies aren’t immune. Distrust breeds turnover—remaining staff quietly quit or jump ship, as Patrick McAdams of recruiting firm Andiamo told the Post. Innovation suffers when fear replaces boldness, a risk for an industry banking on AI breakthroughs. On X, @NewstalkZB speculated Meta’s cuts “make way for AI,” but at what cost? Firms like SAP SE and PayPal Holdings Inc., launching AI-driven platforms this week, may outpace rivals slow to adapt, yet talent wars loom if workers balk at instability. Tech’s cultural shift compounds the problem. Gone are the Lizzo concerts Google once hosted, per a 2022 WSJ piece; now, desk-sharing and austerity rule. “Efficiency over ethics,” @gamefrenza quipped in Spanish and English, capturing a global view of tech’s new ethos. The bleeding may continue—45% of U.S. managers foresee AI-driven cuts this year, per a recent business study. Yet glimmers of resilience emerge. Pulsant’s UK data-center expansion and Bharti Airtel’s subsea cable, announced this week, signal infrastructure bets. Hiring persists in AI niches, and startups like Monomi Park are scooping up Big Tech castoffs, per a 2022 WIRED note still relevant. For workers, upskilling is survival. Amber Adamson, laid off from Covetrus, is honing coding skills, per a 2023 Washington Post story echoing today’s reality. Employers must rebuild trust—transparency, not platitudes, is key. As Samaraweera, ex-Jellysmack, told NBC last year, “Tech doesn’t seem safe anymore.” In 2025, that’s the industry’s stark truth—and its urgent challenge.

Title: Nvidia's new AI tool can teach sign language

Nvidia (NVDA-2.20%) is launching an artificial intelligence-powered platform for learners of American Sign Language — the third-most prevalently used language in the U.S. Together with the American Society for Deaf Children and creative agency Hello Monday, Nvidia developed an interactive web platform called Signs to support ASL learning. The platform will also provide a dataset validated by fluent ASL users and interpreters that developers can use to build more accessible AI applications. Signs features a library of ASL signs for learners to improve their vocabulary, as well as a 3D avatar teacher. Learners can get real-time feedback on their signing via an AI tool that analyzes webcam footage. The platform initially has 100 signs, and is focused on hand movements and finger positions. Users can also learn the meanings of different facial expressions and head movements. Nvidia said it wants to grow the signs library to 400,000 video clips for 1,000 signed words. Signs users can contribute to the video dataset, which is open-source. The company added that it plans to make the dataset available to the public for building accessible AI agents, video conferencing features, and other AI tools. “Most deaf children are born to hearing parents. Giving family members accessible tools like Signs to start learning ASL early enables them to open an effective communication channel with children as young as six to eight months old,” Cheri Dowling, executive director of the American Society for Deaf Children, said in a statement. “And knowing that professional ASL teachers have validated all the vocabulary on the platform, users can be confident in what they’re learning.” The company is currently working with the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research to improve the platform, and is looking to include regional and slang terms in the Signs library. The dataset will be released sometime this year, Nvidia said, and the ASL learning service is live now. Meanwhile, Nvidia is preparing for its annual GPU Technology Conference in March, where attendees can also use Signs. The company is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings next week.

Title: The Gist: AI, a talking dog for the 21st Century.

Time Published: 2025-02-20T16:21:57Z
Full Content:
Séamas O'Reilly on the year's biggest con, AI. This is a Christmas Cracker Gist. An invited essay by Séamas O'Reilly Joseph "Yellow Kid" Weil is something of a legend.The self-proclaimed “master swindler” was the paragon of the early twentieth century con man. In his time, he posed as the immaculately tailored owner of a talking dog, a medicine show huckster, an oil-field prospector and an infinite number of prestigious businessmen reluctantly cajoled into sharing a surefire stock tip - for a price. He plied his trade on street corners, boardrooms, race-tracks and betting shops, separating his marks from their money via means so ingenious many of them have lived on a century later. If you’ve seen the ruse which serves as the centre point of 1973 crime caper The Sting, you’ll know one of his greatest hits; the fake bookie’s shop, staffed with dozens of stooges, all working in concert to con one rich mark out of his money. He’s said to have scammed Benito Mussolini out of $2 million and, in 1899, was widely reported to have sold a perfectly unremarkable chicken to an oil baron for the measly price of a thumb sized piece of pure gold. That last wheeze was, in fact, so widely reported that it lives on in the foodstuff which was subsequently named in his honour; the chicken nugget. In Weil’s marvellous memoir, Con Man, there is scarcely a paragraph that doesn’t induce lip-smacking glee at his audacity, or the bottomless reserve of credulity he encounters from sober, serious people who, surely you think, should know better. His true genius, conveyed in great detail, was in diagnosing the psychology of the mark, which is to say the psychology of the human soul. In the business of offering “something for nothing”, the person you’re conning is almost always your co-conspirator. "Each of my victims” he writes, “had larceny in his heart.". I return to Weil’s scams, and his judgments of human nature, often. I see them each time, say, a billionaire runs for the American presidency on a platform of helping the downtrodden by cutting taxes for his wealthy friends, or a cohort of British elites succeed in selling ‘sovereignty and independence’ for the measly price of a place within the world’s largest trading bloc. Increasingly, however, I see it most prominently in the vaunted halls of tech, and nowhere more regularly than in the field of AI. To be clear at the outset, there are obviously elements of AI which show promise. The elimination of many rote and tedious tasks in our daily labours should be greeted as a boon, and AI’s work in highly specialised and technical tasks could prove more exciting still. Early developments in linguistics and pattern recognition already suggest that AI could, and hopefully will, lead to terrific advances in everything from ancient translation to early diagnosis of disease. In such use-cases, however, there is very little guff about this technology’s sentience, nor mention of that dreaded unicorn “artificial general intelligence”. They are simply ingenious and exciting tools which have solid and encouraging applications but do not, crucially, gesture toward an omniscience that does not exist, and which be undesirable if it did. As an ordinary internet user, I despise almost every in-road into my life that AI has made in the past few years, from incompetent chat services to bafflingly inchoate Google search functions, and the deadening churn of bots on every social media platform left alive. There are dozens of terrible AI versions of my own book being freely sold on Amazon, one of which I even bought in a futile attempt to scry its contents for some form of meaning. As someone in the creative field, I am sympathetic to the most common critique of AI within that sphere – namely, that its ‘artistic’ output amounts to lazy, error-riddled garbage which is morally and stylistically repulsive, while plagiarising and undercutting actual human artists – but this only nibbles at the edges of how I feel about the topic. Because my main problem with AI is not that that it creates ugly, immoral, boring slop (which it does). Nor even that it disenfranchises artists and impoverishes workers, (though it does that too). No, my main problem with AI is that its current pitch to the public is suffused with so much unsubstantiated bullshit, that I cannot banish from my thoughts the sight of a well-dressed man peddling a miraculous talking dog. The claims made by AI evangelists are so broad and plentiful that compiling a pleasingly long paragraph of purported use-cases is as simple as Googling “AI + [noun]”. Having now done just that, I am happy to report that AI will apparently make you rich, find you a date, make you a better lover, a better parent, a better writer, a better worker, a better boss, a better person, a better soldier, will fight all wars, end all wars, hobble terrorists, empower terrorists, make you immortal, end crime, cause crime, solve the housing crisis, revolutionise architecture, cure cancer, and make you a perfect creamy fettuccine with pineapple and cashew sauce. Some of the above links are more nuanced in their prescriptions, but all advance the same basic claim: AI has world-changing implications for just about every concept or phenomenon you can name, and several you can’t. The problem is, AI is not only unfit to do many of those tasks better (or even more cheaply) than humans, but if it was, in several cases, I’d set fire to every server farm I could find and urge you to do the same. Let’s take Large Language Models as an example, since they’re the most well-known piece of broadly usable AI tech on the market. Much of their notoriety stems from the fact that its hallucinations are so infamous as to be cliché. We all, I’m sure, have our favourites, like meal planners that recommend putting glue on pizza and eating three rocks a day; mushroom foraging bots which suggest users cook and prepare entirely fatal fungi; or supermarket apps that cheerfully prescribe recipes for “aromatic water” AKA chlorine gas. It should be observed that such examples are not merely failures because they advocate things that kill their users (although this is not ideal) but because they take the place of existing repositories of information which had little-to-no use case for replacement. In so doing, they’ve also managed to muddy the waters of online information gathering to the point that that even if we scrubbed every trace of those hallucinations from the internet – a likely impossible task - the resulting lack of trust could never quite be purged. Imagine, if you will, the release of a car which was not only dangerous and unusable in and of itself, but which made people think twice before ever entering any car again, by any manufacturer, so long as they lived. How certain were you, five years ago, that an odd ingredient in an online recipe was merely an idiosyncratic choice by a quirky, or incompetent, chef, rather than a fatal addition by a robot? How certain are you now? Some quibble and say that these are just teething problems, the inevitable – even amusing – first steps of a technology finding its feet. But that next step, itself, seems illusory. The scaling of AI to something more workable will require geometrically more investment and computing power than the squillions it has already swallowed up on its path to being the current shit product that nobody trusts. Even enthusiastic reporting on the success of OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, can’t avoid mentioning that the company is on track to lose $5 billion this year. Up to now, their financing has been driven by massive cash injections from the same cheery ranks of hedge funds, soft banks, and petrostates which have propped up every loss-making company you can name for the last decade, from Uber to WeWork to FTX. As recently as July, we saw signs that the market might not be quite as enthusiastic about doing so anymore. It may not be a bubble, but it certainly looks reasonably bubble-shaped, leading tech writer Ed Zitron to convincingly argue we should be referring to the sector as “Subprime AI”. Cory Doctorow goes further in arguing our only task going forward should be working out what kind of bubble it is, the kind that leaves something behind, or the kind that does not. The cost, both financially and in terms of energy resources, of making good on the promises of Artificial General Intelligence are so vast as to approach Death Star numbers, before we even contend with logistical problems of training AI in the first place. The pool of real-world information on which AI has yet to be trained is not merely dwindling but is, itself, now so polluted by AI-generated content that this task is rendered more difficult still. Chlorine gas air defusers and superglue pizzas are all well and good when they’re merely poisoning amateur cooks, but they have also poisoned the very well from which AI must now train itself, and separating out the hallucinations from real information grows more difficult with every line of robot doggerel these same companies ceaselessly barf into the digital ether. All of which is to elide the real harms of this technology we currently see in the world around us. In his recent, and spectacular, takedown of current AI orthodoxy, The Phony Comforts Of Useful Idiots, Edward Ongweso Jr lists some harrowing examples, such as the incompetent crime detection software currently putting American criminal justice in the hands of the machine, the discriminatory welfare algorithm which wrongly accused 26,000 Dutch families of fraud, and the ongoing use of AI to enable the ‘mass assassination factory’ of Gaza. In all such cases, AI’s “errors” are both devastating, and hard to even label as errors at all, so much as a bleakly useful abrogation of responsibility for the bad actors intent on protecting the dystopian interests of those in power. It is not the thought of eight fingered portraits or garbled auto-generated novels which prompt me to indulge in cheery reveries of burning server farms to the ground. It is the spectre of yet more dehumanised populations, preyed upon by dehumanised systems of state violence. I hate AI because it does not work at most of the things its promoters claim it does, and many of the things it does do are explicitly evil. Its missteps not only kill but dissolve the fragile fabric of trust in information we have left. The jargon of AI boosterism, like NFTs and cryptocurrency before them, has seized the imaginations of punters and investors who believe they’re being led to a world of ease and profit that will change the world and make them filthy rich in the process. It’s the last true “something for nothing” we have left, delivered via mechanisms so abstruse to the lay person that its powers can be described with the folkloric hyperbole of a magic chicken. As a teen, I first encountered Arthur C. Clarke’s famous maxim, “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, and marvelled at its concision. I was too slow, however, to realise the transitive property hidden within his neat equation: if all technology is just magic we don’t yet understand, then any old bollocks can be marketed as technology, so long as it’s conveyed to us via a mage class of tech wizards with a passion for turtlenecks, eugenics, and the removal of vowels from proper nouns. It’s a boom time for our new medicine men. Joseph Weil has nothing on them. The Government has a new policy to increase housing, which is to keep doing their failed policy, but even harder. This is the Gist. Wednesday's Dáil chaos reveals the limits of Executive power. This is the Gist. The election campaign ended with the public's vote but only now do we have a Government. This is the final Campaign Gist. The last of the holiday pieces before normal service is resumed is a short story I wrote when I was 20. This is the New Year's Gist. News, Data policy, law and the absurdity of life. A round up of what Ireland's talking about.

Title: Uber: Growth At A Reasonable Price With Ackman Backing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/02/20/uber-growth-at-a-reasonable-price-with-ackman-backing/
Time Published: 2025-02-20T15:44:11Z

By Blue Chip Portfolios Shares of Uber Technologies, Inc (UBER, Financial) have proved a disappointing investment over the past year. Uber shares have delivered a total return of roughly 4% while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of roughly 22% over the same time period. While the company has delivered solid results including impressive revenue growth and significant margin improvement, investors have become skeptical of the long-term prospects of the company due to the threat of autonomous vehicles. However, I believe the company is poised to benefit from autonomous vehicles over the long-run. Investing guru Bill Ackman appears to agree with this view and recently initiated a $2.3 billion position in the stock. Uber shares currently trade at an above-market forward price to earnings ratio of 30x based on consensus full year 2025 earnings per share estimates. However, I believe the stock is undervalued given its strong growth prospects. Uber is a technology company which operates platforms that connect consumers with providers of services. The company's largest business is its mobility business which accounts for roughly 52% of revenue. Uber's other key business is its delivery business which accounts for roughly 33% of revenue. Uber's freight business, which has struggled to generate profitability, accounts for the remaining share of revenue. The company has operations in roughly 70 countries globally and derives roughly 50% of its revenue from the U.S. While Uber has been around since 2009 the company historically struggled to generate profitability. That has changed over the past year as Uber reported net income of nearly $10 billion compared to net income of just under $2 billion of net income for 2023. It is important to note is the $10 billion figure includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to a one-time tax revaluation. Even after backing out the $6.4 billion benefit, Uber's profit growth remains impressive. Uber Operating Revenue by Business Segment Over the past five years, Uber has grown its revenues at a roughly 28% compound annual growth rate. Growth has been strong in both the company's mobility and delivery segments. I expect this trend to continue going forward as the company is set to expand by increasing market penetration outside of the U.S. and in smaller cities within the U.S. Uber Revenue and Net Income Chart In addition to increasing market penetration in both its mobility and delivery business, I believe that Uber is also poised to see significant benefits from the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Currently, Uber has an operating partnership with Waymo in Phoenix and has announced plans to expand this partnership to Austin and Atlanta in 2025. One thing to note is that Waymo has been operating on its own, without a partnership with Uber, in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The fact that Waymo has decided to partner with Uber in new markets after operating previously without Uber in certain markets suggests that the benefits of being an option on the Uber platform exceed the costs related to sharing a portion of profits from each ride with Uber. For Uber, Waymo represents a significant growth opportunity as it will lead to additional supply of vehicles. Currently, limited supply of new drivers has proved a growth headwind for the company. In addition to providing additional supply, autonomous vehicles are likely to result in a lower cost to serve as autonomous vehicles do not require a human driver. Another reason why I believe autonomous vehicles operators are likely to partner with Uber is the fact that there are likely to be multiple different autonomous vehicles options in the future. Elon Musk has said that Tesla plans to launch its own autonomous vehicles later in 2025. Amazon backed Zoox also plans to launch autonomous vehicles in the near future. Thus, it appears likely that multiple autonomous vehicles will be available in the next few years. The existence of multiple autonomous vehicle options on the market favors Uber because the company is uniquely positioned to be an aggregation platform where consumers can quickly and easily evaluate different options including traditional vehicle options with a driver. Uber is a highly valuable partner for autonomous vehicle providers as the scale of Uber's customer base results in more efficiency for autonomous vehicle operations that would be the case if they were operating on their own with a smaller customer base. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi commented on benefits that autonomous vehicle operates experience from being available through Uber during the Q4 earnings call: Uber also recently announced a partnership with Nvidia to share data from its platform to help accelerate autonomous mobility. Currently, consensus estimates call for Uber to report revenue growth of 15%, 15%, and 14% for full years 2025- 2027. Consensus estimates for full year 2025 earnings per share call for a decline of 46% as full year 2024 earnings per share included a one-time positive impact of $6.4 billion due to a tax revaluation. Consensus earnings per share estimates for full years 2026-2028 call for the company to deliver earnings per share growth of 36%, 24%, and 19% respectively. Bill Ackman recently announced that his Pershing Square Capital Management has acquired a stake of more than $2.3 billion in Uber. Ackman noted that he believes that Uber is a high- quality business that can currently be purchased at a massive discount to intrinsic value. Additionally, Ackman noted that he believes autonomous vehicles represent a major positive catalyst for the company rather than a disruptive force. While I believe investors should always do their own work and come to their own conclusion, Ackman's backing is a clear positive. This is especially true given the fact that Ackman has a strong history of finding attractive growth at a reasonable price investments. Some of Ackman's notable successful growth investments include Chipotle Mexican Grill and Hilton Worldwide. Moreover, at more than $2.3 billion Ackman's Uber bet is now his largest position which suggests he has a high degree of conviction in the investment. Uber currently trades at 30x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share and 22x consensus full year 2026 earnings per share. While this valuation represents a moderate premium to the S&P 500, Uber has much strong near-term growth prospects than the broader market. Uber's closest publicly traded peers are Lyft and DoorDash which trade at 13x and 42x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share. Lyft trades at a significant discount due to its relatively small size and focus on the mobility business which is viewed as less attractive than the delivery business. Uber generates roughly 32% of its revenue from its delivery business with the bulk of the remainder coming from its mobility segment. Based on a blended peer multiple assuming a 32% weight on DoorDash's valuation and 68% on Lyft, Uber's peer valuation would be roughly 22x consensus full year 2025 earnings. While Uber's current valuation of 30x represents a premium to its blended peer valuation, I believe this premium is well deserved given the fact that Uber has larger scale than these rivals. Moreover, I also believe that in the long-run Uber will benefit from additional cross selling and economies of scale given its large presence in both the mobility and delivery markets. For example, Uber's R&D spend can be leveraged to benefit both its mobility and deliver businesses. Uber's valuation also appears attractive vs other companies poised to benefit from the autonomous vehicle trend such as Tesla which trades at 124x consensus full year 2025 consensus earnings per share. The biggest risk to the Uber bull case is that autonomous vehicle providers decide to circumvent Uber and go direct to consumer with large scale offerings. While I view this as highly unlikely given recent developments with Waymo and the fact that Uber has a massive customer base, it is not impossible. Such a development would be more likely to occur in the event that only one autonomous vehicle wins out in the end. Comparably, if there are autonomous vehicles offered by multiple players then Uber should be well position to be the platform of choice for consumers as it easily allows users to compare options. Another risk to the Uber bull case would be if Lyft were to be acquired by a stronger player. For example, Amazon or DoorDash would appear to be a suitable buyer for Lyft and could create a platform with greater scale than is currently the case. Such a combination could result in more competition for Uber and thus lead to margin pressures in the future. Uber shares have not kept pace with the broader market rally over the past year. The company has a strong history of delivering consistent revenue growth and has recently started delivering very strong earnings growth. The company is well positioned to benefit from secular growth trends going forward and has the potential to be a major beneficiary of autonomous vehicles. The stock trades at a reasonable valuation relative to the broader market and peers. Moreover, the company has the backing of investing guru Bill Ackman, I believe the stock represents a compelling growth at a reasonable price investment opportunity.

Title: New UK-Based Climate Group Emerges as Banks Retreat
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/02/20/812605.htm
Time Published: 2025-02-20T15:41:21Z
Full Content:
It was a dank, drizzly February evening when about 120 people gathered in the brightly lit art gallery of London’s Guildhall, surrounded by gold-framed paintings ranging from Pre-Raphaelites to realists. At the event, Alok Sharma, a former member of the UK parliament who served as president-designate of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021, announced the launch of the Transition Finance Council. The goal of the London-based group, which includes banking executives, is to rally the City of London, companies and policymakers to scale funding for decarbonization efforts at home and abroad. The intention is “to ensure that London is positioned as a preeminent financial hub for transition financing” and to “deliver at scale the finance to transition the global economy” to cleaner energy sources, Sharma said in his speech. As Sharma pointed out, it was five years ago almost to the day that a similar event took place in the same building. The UK government, together with the Bank of England, had rallied six times as many people for the launch of what was called the private finance agenda for COP26. That gathering was a more boisterous affair. The room was “packed to the rafters,” Sharma recalled. Mark Carney, then BOE governor, took the stage to interview legendary biologist and broadcaster David Attenborough. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, dialed in. It was “the point at which talk of sustainable finance and climate action moved from being a [corporate social responsibility] issue to being a C-suite issue,” Sharma said. A year later, Carney introduced the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, an industry initiative uniting firms with more than $70 trillion of assets to accelerate the transition to net zero. Much, of course, has changed since then. Starting in December, all of the largest US and Canadian banks began fleeing the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, itself once part of the broader GFANZ framework. And last week, Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd. said it too was retreating from the coalition. The defections occurred as financial institutions seek to avoid right-wing attacks on sustainability and renewable energy, a US Republican-led war on behalf of the oil industry that’s only intensified with Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The insurance sector’s climate alliance also has been discontinued, while a similar group in the fund-management industry is on pause as it seeks to ensure that it remains “fit for purpose.” There’s “a lot of turmoil,” said Nina Seega, director of the Centre for Sustainable Finance at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. “Rhetoric is shifting and climate denial is becoming much more mainstream, so you then see a shift in the way different financial institutions are dealing with that.” Some are under more pressure than others, she said, but “none are immune.” Last week, a few minutes before Sharma took the microphone to announce the Transition Finance Council’s formation, one chief sustainability officer (CSO) of a large UK-based investment manager was asking attendees who they thought would be the next company to retreat from net zero. The query wasn’t surprising. CSOs face a more difficult landscape these days, what with big firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BlackRock Inc. quitting climate-finance groups. On Wednesday, HSBC announced it’s pushed back its deadline to meet a number of key climate targets by two decades. As more companies back away, there are serious questions about the financial industry’s long-term commitment—and capacity—to help slow increasingly catastrophic global warming. Forced to battle headwinds both inside and outside their firms, many CSOs are concerned they may no longer have the full support of their companies and leadership teams. “Finance is being politicized, if not weaponized,” said Clemens Calice, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who set up his own investment and advisory firm, Cygnum Capital. “Companies are under increasing pressure to align with a side or an agenda.” For CSOs, all of this amounts to a “very challenging operating environment,” said James Alexander, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association. Politics and policy have “become much more fractured,” making judgment calls “much harder to make.” At the same time, he said, “if you’re managing money, your responsibility is to consider risks, and sustainability is undeniably one of those risks.” Britain stands out as a rare example of a country that’s advancing on climate action. Seven of the world’s 10 largest economies missed a recent deadline to file updated emissions-saving plans with the United Nations. The UK was the only one to outline a strategy for the next decade that’s anywhere close to consistent with the Paris Agreement target to keep warming below 1.5C. “I’m very pleased to say” that the UK “has a government which recognizes that there is no trade-off between economic growth and the drive to decarbonize the economy,” Sharma said. The country is “uniquely positioned to lead.” (GFANZ is co-chaired by Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, and Mary Schapiro, the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.) North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corp., one of the biggest US power providers, removed a mention of climate targets in its latest earnings release as the company builds more natural gas plants and even reconsiders its plans for coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. Duke said in its third-quarter earnings release last year that it was “executing an ambitious clean energy transition” and noted its goals to emit net-zero methane by 2030 and net-zero carbon by 2050. But the company’s fourth-quarter release on Thursday, while stating it was “executing an ambitious energy transition,” omitted the word “clean” and left out emissions goals. Though Duke says its strategy hasn’t changed, the move comes as Trump, who previously called climate change a “hoax” though has occasionally modulated that claim since, is nevertheless trying to increase production of fossil fuels while simultaneously seeking to zero-out net-zero policies. Duke said late last year it would consider shifting its plans for coal plants if the US president follows through on his promises to terminate rules governing power-plant pollution.

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun The state’s investment board’s stake is worth more than $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10. Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin’s current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale’s bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin’s stake in IBIT.

Title: Here Is What Wall Street Analysts Are Forecasting About NVIDIA’s GB200, B200, And NVL Rack Server Shipments Ahead Of The Earnings Next Week

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Wall Street analysts remain split on the extent to which NVIDIA's slower production ramp-up of the GB200 GPU would end up affecting its upcoming earnings and the outlook for the year ahead. While Baird analyst Tristan Gerra is dismissive of all "lingering concerns around [the] GB200 mix for the year," his counterpart at HSBC is much more cautious, lowering his forecast for NVL rack server shipments for the year from 35,000 units to 30,000 units. To wit, Baird analyst has leveraged his supply chain meetings to note that GB200 shipments are now finally gaining momentum after a "late and slow start." In what is a critical tidbit, Gerra notes that apart from "architectural novelties" that took time to optimize, the GB200 GPUs were also initially constrained by the available data center infrastructure (electricity/space). The analyst goes on to note: "Investors should not assume that these initial delays will lead customers to skip to the next-generation products. We expect GB200 to represent the majority of NVIDIA's GB mix in 2H25 and into 2026. GB300 crossover is expected not until 2H26." Meanwhile, as mentioned above, HSBC analyst Frank Lee is much more cautious on NVIDIA, going so far as to take the rare step of lowering his stock price target for the GPU manufacturer from $185 to $175, while maintaining an overall 'Buy' rating. Lee believes GB200's "supply chain issues" could remain an "overhang going into H1FY26." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's fiscal year concludes in January, hence its mismatch with the December-ending calendar year. Coming back, Lee has now lowered his "FY26e NVL rack server assumption from 35k to 30k [units]," while noting that NVIDIA will be able to "offset the slower GB200 ramp with upside in B200 GPU shipments in H1 FY26e," enabling the company to still "book Blackwell revenues of cUSD5bn and cUSD10bn in 4QFY25 and 1QFY26, respectively, leading to total revenue of USD40bn/42.2bn in 4QFY25/1QFY26 vs consensus of USD38.2bn/USD42bn." As for the upcoming earnings, Lee expects NVIDIA to show $40 billion in total sales for Q4'25 against a company-guided figure of $37.5 billion and Wall Street's consensus estimate of $38.2 billion. The HSBC analyst concludes his note with the following projection: "We also expect 1QFY26/2QFY26 sales of USD42.2bn/USD55.4bn vs consensus of USD42bn/USD46.2bn, implying H1 FY26 is unlikely to disappoint the market despite ongoing supply side issues." Elsewhere, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh concedes that "manufacturing constraints are limiting shipments of GB200 NVL server racks," but predicts that "this will be more than offset by the following: 1) given the lower initial manufacturing yields of GB200 NVL, we believe customers have been able to push out orders of GB200 and backfill with HGX-based B200 servers with x86 head nodes; 2) DeepSeek, as well as limited supply of Huawei’s Ascend AI ASIC, has created a surge in demand for H20 GPUs from China CSPs; 3) we believe NVDA’s customers, esp CSPs, are financing its inventory at EMS providers, so effectively sell-in shipments from NVDA to EMS are recognized as revenues." Finally, we bring you Oppenheimer's investment note on NVIDIA, where analyst Rick Schafer projects that the demand for H200 GPUs remains stronger than expected and will constitute ~30 percent of the company's sales mix this year. On the GB300 GPU, Schafer notes: "We believe GB300 (expected late CY25) likely a single rack (NVL72) configuration, suggesting DC cooling kinks being ironed out." The Oppenheimer analyst goes on to note that "DeepSeek [is] a positive for NVDA as CSPs rapidly integrate innovations into Western models." Schafer also thinks that the CapEx of hyperscalers will be up 40 percent this year to over $300 billion vs. the $220 billion figure for 2024. And, in what aligns with our previous post on the topic, Schafer thinks AI ASICs will coexist with GPUs: "CSP custom AI ASIC projects coexist with GPUs, in our view—ASICs primarily used for internal workloads while GPUs used for broader, dynamic, higher performance AI applications. NVDA remains best positioned in AI, benefiting from full-stack AI hardware/software."

Title: Bird flu: They Are Re-Running The COVID Script

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Feb 20, 2025 | Coincidence, Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Headline News, Health | 2 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. Bird flu is a rerun of COVID-19. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The pandemic planners have a playbook; they used it for COVID-19 and now they are using it for bird flu, with one difference. With COVID-19, they targeted us directly. With bird flu, they are targeting us indirectly through our food supply. It is currently being claimed that bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry, dairy cows and cats, and has resulted in several human cases in the US, including a recent case in Wyoming. By coincidence, yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) gave conditional approval for an updated bird flu vaccine for poultry. An outbreak of bird flu at a farm in New Zealand in December resulted in the culling of almost 160,000 hens. But, warned New Zealand’s Biosecurity Minister yesterday, a different strain of the flu was circulating globally and would likely arrive in New Zealand. At the end of January, GAVI “Vaccines Work” was delighted to announce that restrictions had been put in place in the UK to curb the spread of bird flu. Almost 1.8 million farmed and captive birds have been culled in the past three months due to avian flu outbreaks across the UK. Reuters reported yesterday that there has been an outbreak of bird flu in Canada. And so, it goes on. Countries’ pandemic-vaccine industries are moving in lockstep, just as they did with COVID-19. In the following, Clayton Baker explains more about their pandemic playbook, which they used for COVID-19 and are now using for bird flu. “Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it,” he writes. Although he refers to the pandemic industry in the USA, similar can be applied worldwide. Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook By Clayton J. Baker as published by Brownstone Institute Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the laboratory-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS-CoV-2, was leaked from a laboratory. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the laboratory leak by denying its occurrence while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing, along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now with H5N1 bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, Georgia. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other laboratories. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatises farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyses decision-makers and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.TheCDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing Health and Human Services (“HHS”) agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the covid era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s biography shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. 6. The Kawaoka Bird flu laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. 7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. People such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (“OPPR”).Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 million bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled. 10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognise what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Since Trump is intent on issuing as many executive orders as he can, why hasn’t he ordered USDA to stop testing chickens for the (figmentary) bird flu? Not only is that rogue agency culling entire flocks for just one “asymptomatic” positive PCR test, they’re using it as an excuse to cull the flocks of commercial farms within 5-7 miles of the PCR positive flock. Trump’s failure to stop the psychopaths from executing the Covid script against our nation’s poultry farmers is the reason for the eggflation. Now the script has extended to PCR testing cattle, which means higher beef prices are no doubt ahead. SB, its a chess game. My theory is that Trump is letting this kind of stuff (which terrifies the ignorant, the same ones that oppose his efforts) so much of his opposition (press?) is occupied with this stuff and have even more trouble keeping up with and criticizing Trump’s waste and fraud cleansing efforts. I’ve thought on this a while and wondered the same. I think Trump is allowing this to confuse and terrify his enemies. So many are worried about the bird flu and their attention is split away from TDS activities. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Title: Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fund big AI bets

Time Published: 2025-02-20T12:06:42Z
Full Content:
Good morning! A fully remote job where you're left alone and get paid up to $30 an hour. Interested? Training AI might be the gig for you. In today's big story, BI obtained a leaked recording of an Amazon all-hands showing how the tech giant plans to cut costs so it can make big bets. What's on deck Markets: Investors are getting cocky about the stock market, and that could be a red flag. Tech: Why Microsoft's quantum 'breakthrough' is so important. Business: This EV maker was once more valuable than Ford. Now it's bankrupt. But first, we're robbing Peter to pay Paul. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fuel its endless appetite for big AI bets. Amazon is the latest tech giant trying to find the sweet spot between saving money and not shying away from making big bets. The company's retail CEO, Doug Herrington, told employees to keep reducing costs so it can fund "big investments in big new businesses," according to a recording of last month's internal all-hands meeting that Business Insider's Eugene Kim obtained. In an ideal world, companies' big bets can save them money in the long run. Amazon's investments in AI and warehouses have helped it lower the costs of fulfilling customers' orders. Amazon Robotics' chief technologist, Tye Brady, spoke to Eugene about the progress made there. Finding the balance between savings and innovation is key. Herrington told employees every team should simultaneously look to reduce costs and develop new ideas. Gail Carpenter, Amazon's retail CFO, also described how cost-cutting is part of a wider formula, not a one-way street. "As a reminder, this work isn't just about cost reduction — it enables us to invest in a better customer experience," she said in the meeting. Companies' big bets can take a while to pay off, though. AI projects aren't cheap, from hardware and data center needs to the talent to get it up and running. And while expectations are high for AI's impact, those benefits haven't fully materialized. In the meantime, tech companies can't afford to take their foot off the gas, lest they risk falling behind competitors. And if the big bets aren't helping companies save money yet, they'll need to look elsewhere. Amazon has laid off at least 27,000 people since late 2022 and shrunk less profitable businesses like its fashion and fitness program. Meta, which hasn't backed down from its massive tech budget, has also taken steps to cut spending while remaining aggressive on the AI front. The company recently cut thousands of underperformers, taking a page from Amazon's playbook, while simultaneously ramping up hiring machine-learning engineers. The government is employing fewer people and they're traveling less. United Airlines could lose millions of dollars. 1. Are we too confident in the stock market? Good news: Americans are actually feeling hopeful about the market. Bad news: We need a healthy dose of skepticism to watch out for risks. The confidence investors are feeling about stocks could quickly turn to arrogance, leaving them exposed. 2. Breaking up with Bumble. The dating app's stock plummeted on Wednesday following its latest earnings report, which forecasted lower-than-expected sales. Since its 2021 IPO, Bumble has lost over 90% of its market value. Shifting habits and app fatigue are problems for dating platforms, perhaps lowering how much users are willing to pay for Bumble's service. 3. Palantir's stock slumps. Shares of the software company, which is a major US defense contractor, tanked 10% after reports that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered budget cuts. The slump ended a four-day winning streak for Palantir, whose stock had, until Wednesday, surged 65% this year. 1. Hey, Siri. Tell me about the new $599 iPhone with AI. Apple announced its budget-friendly iPhone 16e, available to preorder on Friday. The phone is complete with Apple Intelligence and an Action button for shortcuts. After a rocky period for iPhone sales, a cheaper version is Apple's chance to attract new customers with its new AI features. 2. There are no guarantees in the world of startups, but these companies are good bets. Silicon Valley's past few years have been filled with cost-cutting and layoffs, but AI has brought excitement back to the industry. BI compiled 43 startups — focused on everything from women's health to security — worth betting your career on. 3. Microsoft's quantum "breakthrough." Microsoft on Wednesday unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum chip the company says is powered by a new state of matter. "Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed," CEO Satya Nadella said. The development is "just as revolutionary as the silicon transistor," a quantum expert told BI. 1. Monopolies and murder. The manifesto found on Luigi Mangione before he was accused and charged in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson doesn't focus too much on the quality of healthcare in the US. Instead, the note largely discusses the size of its parent company, UnitedHealth Group. In other words, Mangione seemed to be angry about monopolization — and it points to a very real trend: American business is bigger than ever. 2. Big Tech's data centers have a pollution problem. The solution could be to bury it. AI data centers are still largely powered by fossil fuels despite promises of leveraging renewable or low-carbon energy sources. Big Tech is now exploring carbon capture, which essentially means burying carbon emissions underground. It's not a new technique, but it's both costly and complex. 3. Another EV startup runs out of charge. Electric-truck startup Nikola filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The truck maker rode a wave of enthusiasm when it went public in 2020 and was once worth more than Ford. However, the startup was later engulfed in a high-profile fraud scandal and ultimately failed to commercialize its tech. It's the latest once-promising EV startup to collapse. Elon Musk is hunting for Social Security fraud. It's not very common. Walmart reports Q4 earnings The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Vanguard Pauses Corporate Meetings Over New ESG Guidance

Top mutual fund manager Vanguard has paused meetings with portfolio companies while it reviews the impact of new guidance on investor activism from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the matter. In a recent notice, the SEC, whose acting chair was appointed by President Donald Trump, revised its “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations in ways that could put new burdens on firms like Vanguard that now rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the SEC said managers may need to use the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs, if they pressure management on matters like climate questions or whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Vanguard put the pause in place because it is “trying to process and understand the new guidelines so they can remain a 13G filer and not a 13D filer,” said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Ending the meetings could reduce the power of shareholder activists focused on environmental, social or governance questions, corporate attorneys say, the apparent goal of the SEC’s current leadership. But it could also diminish the input that executives receive from top investors on more traditional corporate questions like executive pay. A Vanguard representative did not respond to questions on Tuesday. Rival asset manager BlackRock had also paused meetings with some of its portfolio companies. A company representative did not immediately comment on the status of these meetings on Tuesday.

Gold is heading $3000 per ounce and likely to well cross $3080 in Q1 2025 Key Positive Drivers With the increased U.S. trade tariffs there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding the U.S. trade policy.

Manav Modi, Analyst, Commodity Research, MOFSL Gold witnessed a fall in the yesterday’s session post better than expected housing data, however, prices remained close to record highs as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose more trade tariffs on key imports to the country. Earlier this week, Trump pledged to impose a 25% tariff on automobiles, semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports. Demand was also bolstered by an escalation in the geopolitical landscape. Following a meeting between US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, Trump called Zelensky “a dictator without elections” in a social media post. Fed officials remain uncertain about the impact tariffs might have on inflation. FOMC minutes confirmed Fed pause, officials suggest Trump policies could boost inflation further and also signalled a possible tapering.

Nearly all auto components imported by India are subject to a basic import duty of only 7.5% in India, the company’s Chief Executive Officer Vivek Vikram Singh said in an interview earlier this week. Assuming the worst case scenario of the US still imposing similar tariffs on Indian auto components, Singh said he anticipates the resultant impact to be minimal. - Bloomberg Markets open lower due to Trump's tariff proposal, impacting pharma stocks; consolidation phase with cautious outlook and selective opportunities.

Buzzing Stocks Today, Stocks that will see action today: February 20, 2025 - Patanjali Foods, Kothari Industrial Corp, Mahindra grroup, Religare Enterprises, BSE, Torrent Power, Bharat Forge, Cox & Kings, JBM Auto, Waaree Energies · Strong growth expected in sum assured and rider attachments to protect value of new business margins · Proposed increase in FDI limits is expected to enhance capital flow, supporting the sector’s growth Ratings agency ICRA expects growth in sum assured in the retail segment for insurers to continue to outpace the growth in retail new business premium (NBP). Private insurers saw a surge in retail sum assured by 41% YoY in 9M FY2025 (30% in FY2024), higher than the retail NBP growth of 17% (7% in FY2024). Given the shift in product mix from high value of new business (VNB) margin non-participating (non-par) products to low VNB margin unit-linked investment plan (ULIP) products, the pressure on the VNB margins is likely to continue, resulting in increased sum assured and rider attachments in a bid to offset the negative impact of the product shift. As the capital requirements for life insurers are also a function of the sum assured in force, with higher growth in sum assured, the capital intensity for incremental growth is expected to remain high, resulting in elevated incremental capital requirements for the sector. The recently proposed increase in the foreign direct investment (FDI) limits to 100% could boost the inflow of capital to the sector and reduce the protection gap in India. While historically, the growth in life insurance premiums has been driven by investment considerations, with increased consumer awareness, the industry has seen an uptick in demand for the coverage of mortality risks. While the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) continues to dominate the market with a substantial share in retail and group NBP, however, private insurers lead in terms of sum assured. With a market share of 84% in terms of retail sum assured and 80% in terms of group sum assured in 9M FY2025, private players have a relatively higher share when compared to their market share of 63% and 28% in terms of retail NBP and group NBP, respectively. Neha Parikh, Vice President & Sector Head – Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA said: “Mortality protection demands significant upfront capital, risk management and reinsurance tie-ups, resulting in concentration of the sum assured market. Within the retail and group sum assured, capital requirement is even higher in the retail segment, given that the risk is underwritten for a much longer tenor. Some large private insurers benefit from their long operating history, resulting in backbook surplus[1], hence, partly supporting their ability to underwrite a higher sum assured”. With higher growth in sum assured compared to the NBP segment, the market share in sum assured outstanding at the end of December 2024 is much higher at 65% (45% in FY2018) in the retail segment for the top five private insurers. Given the capital requirements, the market for sum assured is likely to remain skewed towards the insurers who have high backbook surplus or can bring in a larger pool of capital. To augment their capital base, the large private insurers have raised sub-debt of Rs. 29.5 billion (additional sub-debt of Rs. 23.0 billion expected by Mar-2025) and equity of Rs. 19.1 billion in YTDFY2025 compared to the overall sub-debt of Rs. 43.7 billion raised in the previous four years. “The high capital intensity of the life insurance sector necessitates substantial investments to sustain growth. The increase in FDI limits will provide the much-needed capital boost to the sector, enabling insurers to expand their mortality coverage and increasing penetration,” Parikh added. The shift towards ULIPs from the non-participating segment from FY2024 onwards has been driven by the changes in the taxation regime for high ticket non-par policies, buoyancy in equity capital markets and decline in yields on Government securities, thereby lowering the returns on non-par policies. Apart from the need to protect the VNB margins, the growth in sum assured over the years has also been supported by the increase in ticket sizes with the retail sum assured per policy for private insurers rising to Rs. 2.4 million in FY2024 from Rs. 1.3 million in FY2018. For LIC, however, the retail sum assured per policy has remained stable (Rs. 0.3 million) and is much lower compared to the private insurers. Group sum assured also saw significant growth with the growth in credit life, driven by robust credit expansion in the retail segment (CAGR of 18% in FY2021-FY2024), especially unsecured loans (CAGR of 21%), where the penetration of credit life remains higher.
