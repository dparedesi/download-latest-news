View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.mgd773xcp Share article Print article Imagine investing in a premium Central Otago vineyard, or owning a slice of prime Wellington commercial property, all without needing millions in upfront capital. Through asset “tokenisation”, this is becoming a reality. Essentially, tokenisation converts physical and financial assets into digital records, called tokens, which are stored using blockchain technology. Some tokens represent ownership in the way digital property titles or share certificates do. Others might be used for customer loyalty schemes, digital event tickets to prevent scalping, or a means to make fast, low-cost international payments. The blockchain itself is basically a shared digital ledger distributed across computers, with transactions linked into a cryptographic chain. This decentralisation and transparency makes tokenisation both trustworthy and efficient. For decades, investing in real-world assets has meant navigating lawyers, banks, brokers, registries, mountains of paperwork, hefty transaction costs and prohibitive minimum spends. A $10 million commercial building, for example, might require investors to commit large proportions of the full amount, locking out all but the wealthiest buyers. Tokenisation changes this equation for both buyers and sellers. That same building could be split into 100 digital tokens, each representing 1% ownership worth $100,000. Like owning shares in a company, token holders benefit from rental income and property appreciation proportional to their stake. For sellers, it’s a way to raise capital by attracting many smaller investors rather than a few large ones. Digital assets are already woven into New Zealand’s economy. BlockchainNZ reports nearly NZ$8 billion of digital assets traded annually, with interest in digital assets becoming more common. But New Zealand stands at an important juncture. Existing financial regulations weren’t designed with tokenisation in mind, meaning progress is slow and complex. Industry bodies such as BlockchainNZ, the Banking Association and Payments NZ warn that even slight changes in a token’s features can alter its legal classification, making compliance confusing and expensive. Without clear rules, New Zealand risks losing billions to overseas markets offering greater regulatory certainty. Executives from multinational investment company BlackRock have compared tokenisation today to the internet in 1996, something poised for explosive growth. Accounting firm Deloitte projects US$4 trillion in global real estate will be tokenised by 2035, up from less than US$0.3 trillion in 2024. In November 2025, Australia introduced legislation for digital asset platforms, with Treasurer Jim Chalmers citing potential annual gains of A$24 billion. Dubai launched its first tokenised real estate platform in May 2025, projecting US$16 billion in value by 2033. J.P. Morgan Asset Management has launched MONY, a tokenised cash fund that invests in relatively safe short-term debt securities. BlockChainNZ held New Zealand’s first real estate tokenisation forum in Auckland in July 2025. Industry analysis suggests tokenising just 2–3% of the domestic property market could unlock over NZ$60 billion in transaction volume. New Zealand has genuine advantages: internet penetration exceeds 95% of the population; it is a member of the intergovernmental Digital Nations coalition; and it operates an established digital land-title system, ideal for real estate tokenisation. The regulatory conversation is underway, with the Financial Markets Authority releasing a discussion paper on tokenisation in September 2025. But the Banking Association has identified a critical gap: while existing laws are technology-neutral, they lack clarity for tokenised products. It recommends legislative reviews, controlled testing of tokenised financial products, and guidance for industry participants and consumers on regulation and compliance. Ultimately, New Zealand will need a cohesive framework that actively enables safe innovation. As one industry insider has argued: the rails for tokenisation are being laid now and if we don’t help build them, we’ll be forced to run on tracks designed by others. Tokenisation also brings serious challenges. Local financial laws were written for paper certificates and bank vaults, not digital tokens and blockchain networks. When an Auckland property developer tokenises an apartment building, or a Marlborough winery offers digital shares, which rules apply? Are these securities? Property titles? This uncertainty creates a compliance minefield. Technology risks compound these problems: cybersecurity vulnerabilities, digital key theft or loss, bugs or flaws in blockchain code that hackers can exploit, and malfunctions in the technology infrastructure can all cause irreversible losses. Energy-intensive blockchain systems raise environmental concerns, while weak consumer protections can expose users to fraud and scams. Tokenised assets can be highly volatile, with rapid price swings encouraging speculation and panic selling. Easy round-the-clock trading amplifies boom-and-bust cycles. When everyone can trade with a few clicks, panic can spread rapidly. The Financial Markets Authority has warned that market manipulation becomes easier across multiple unregulated platforms, money laundering may be harder to detect in cross-border transactions, and fraud (from fake tokenised assets to digital Ponzi schemes) can scale quickly. None of this means tokenisation should (or can) be avoided. The challenge for New Zealand is to keep up with this form of financial innovation, and to retain investment dollars that might otherwise migrate to other jurisdictions.

Title: Al Gore, Howard Lutnick and Christine Lagarde: What really happened at that Davos dinner

DAVOS, Switzerland – Al Gore didn’t like what Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had to say at a private dinner here at the World Economic Forum – but other guests were far more receptive, On The Money has learned. In fact, many of the Wall Street and government heavyweights in attendance agreed with the key points of his speech – including the fact that Europe can only grow its tech economy by eliminating a myriad of regulations and taxes that are hindering growth, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Gore, as The Post reported, was angry at Lutnick’s remarks that took aim at globalism, the ideology that puts concerns about the world before country – and how it has shafted the American middle class, hollowing out whole communities as factories are off-shored to cheap labor locales in Asia. When Lutnick stepped offstage, Gore walked up to him and said, “Boo” — like he was trying to scare him, a source told The Post. The former US veep has become one of the world’s leading globalists since leaving government and a hawk on the environment, pushing so-called net zero policies that many believe caused countries to slash energy production, sparking global inflation. During a Tuesday VIP dinner hosted by billionaire BlackRock boss Larry Fink, where several hundred people were invited, Lutnick delivered a speech that was at times fiercely critical of European allies on globalism (he said it had failed so much it is now “dead”). He also underscored that regulations and taxes have plagued the EU economy for years, hindering growth and technology advancements. Lutnick said if the EU reformed its tax code and administrative state, US tech giants would flock there. Those comments were met with many in the crowd nodding in agreement, according to people who were there. “No one walked out during his speech as some reported,” said a person close to Lutnick. One report suggested that Christine Lagarde, the European Central Bank president, bolted during the speech. But multiple sources say she left earlier because she was exhausted after a long day of meetings at the World Economic Forum. “That was just fake news,” the person close to Lutnick added.

Lutnick, meanwhile, also said if Europe wants to continue to push strict environmental standards – so-called net zero carbon emission policies by 2036 – it needs to think twice how it’s achieving those goals. At the moment, the EU continues to buy much of its oil from Russia and its windmill turbines from China, two of the world’s most oppressive regimes. Russia, of course, is being one of the bloodiest conflict on continent since World War II with is invasion of Ukraine. “There was no mass exodus or boos unless you count Al Gore,” the person close to Lutnick said.

[AT editor's note: Baloney.

Seems even a private invitation-only hoity-toity dinner is not exactly a classy event anymore. Even Congress is a politer place, given the harrumphing that followed several years ago, when a conservative legislator shouted 'you lied' to some politician who obviously lied.

Title: Elon Musk says it's 'highly likely' humans figure out how to reverse aging — but there's 'some benefit to death'

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Elon Musk says he thinks aging will one day be solved. The world's richest man said getting older was a "very solvable problem" during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum on Thursday. "When we figure out what causes aging, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious. It's not a subtle thing," Musk said. "The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body," But Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives. "You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society. Of things getting locked in place," he said. "It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy, but that said, do I think we'll figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse aging? I think that's highly likely." Musk's surprise appearance was his first time onstage at the World Economic Forum, which he'd previously called "boring af." His conversation with Fink was wide-ranging, but didn't reveal much new information. Dozens of political and business leaders from across the globe gathered in Davos, Switzerland, this week to attend the World Economic Forum. The guest list included President Donald Trump, who made his case for the US to annex Greenland and the US's economic agenda during his address on Wednesday. Trump's push for Greenland has rattled European leaders and the US markets. It's also shocked Greenlanders, who have spoken against the annexation and the Trump administration. "We're not for sale," one resident said. Trump said the US would not use military force to take Greenland, but has leveraged tariffs against European countries in his campaign. The weeklong event ends on Friday with closing remarks from WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning. Jump to

Title: SpaceX Recruiting Four Wall Street Investment Banks For IPO, Report Says

ByZachary Folk, Forbes Staff. SpaceX is lining up four major Wall Street banks to lead its initial public offering, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, as the space tech company prepares for what could be one of the largest IPOs in history that investors hope could value the company at $1.5 trillion. The banks reportedly include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, according to the Financial Times, although more could get involved in the future. The group is currently selling existing shares to value the company at $800 billion, backing up a report of an insider share sale from Bloomberg last month valuing the company at that target. An investor previously told Forbes a 2026 IPO could value the rocket and satellite company at $1.5 trillion, and could potentially make CEO and majority shareholder Elon Musk a trillionaire. The banks declined to comment to FT, and SpaceX did not immediately return a request for comment from Forbes. The largest IPO in history took place in December 2019 when Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian state-run oil company, went public with a portion of its company. The IPO raised about $29 billion from investors, valuing the petroleum company at a staggering $2.03 trillion. Musk spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday for the first time. Speaking to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the billionaire was bullish on the future of SpaceX, offering ambitious promises about using the company’s technology to reach the Moon and Mars. “SpaceX is about… advancing rocket technology to the point where we can extend life and consciousness beyond Earth to the Moon to Mars eventually to other star systems,” Musk said. The SpaceX CEO also expressed a desire to go to Mars himself, which he said was a six month trip away, although the planets only align every two years. “I’ve been asked a few times, ‘Do I want to, you know, die on Mars?’ And I'm like, ‘Yes, but just not on impact."

Title: Bitcoin liquidity just evaporated – and now this Wall Street feedback loop could wipe out gains

As major funds dump holdings, a thin order book means every dollar of selling is now significantly more destructive. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded three straight trading sessions of net outflows this week, totaling $1.58 billion. The pullback follows a brief stretch of positive follow-through, sandwiched between another three-day outflow streak from Jan. 7 – 9 that totaled $1.134 billion, or about $378 million a day leaving the category. Earlier in the month, flows flipped the other way, with more than $1 billion of net inflows over the first two trading days of January and $1.8 billion in inflows between Jan. 12 – 15, setting an early-month risk tone. The swing from fast inflows to a multi-session drawdown has renewed focus on ETF flow prints as a near-term positioning read rather than a passive backdrop. Bitcoin ETFs face record outflows amidst macroeconomic headwinds and dwindling demand. Large outflow days were led by the largest funds, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), arguing against the move being driven by smaller products or idiosyncratic reallocations. When the biggest vehicles lead redemptions, flows are easier to interpret as a broad pullback in real-money demand. They can also feed through to spot-market mechanics because creations and redemptions are ultimately serviced via the fund’s exposure to spot bitcoin, whether delivered in-kind or transacted via cash through the ETF plumbing. That linkage is why multiple negative sessions can matter more than a single print. In an inflow regime, ETFs can provide a steady marginal bid that helps rallies hold and reduces the amount of spot selling required to break key levels. In an outflow regime, that marginal bid thins. Redemptions can add supply at moments when discretionary buyers are already stepping back. The feedback loop becomes more visible when liquidity is lower because the same dollar of selling can move price more. A recent CryptoSlate market note reported order-book depth about 30% below 2025 highs. That is a setup where flow-driven selling can carry more price impact than it would in a deeper book. The macro backdrop adds context for why ETF flows became a “watch this” input in early January. The sharp repricing in Treasurys tied to tariff-related geopolitical uncertainty, with the 10-year yield referenced around the mid-4% range during the move. That mix has tended to pressure high-beta risk exposures when rates volatility rises. Recent crypto drawdowns can be framed alongside a broader risk-off tape, linking Bitcoin’s direction to cross-asset sentiment rather than crypto-specific catalysts alone. In that environment, ETF redemptions become one of the cleaner observable footprints of de-risking. They show what investors are doing in a regulated wrapper that many allocators use for tactical exposure. Positioning around late-January options levels provides another lens for how flows can interact with price. Call open interest clustered around $100,000 into late-January expiries. That keeps attention on whether spot can hold above nearby levels or gets pulled back toward strikes where positioning is dense. If spot hovers below a large call cluster while ETF flows remain negative, rallies can face two headwinds at once: fewer fresh ETF bids and a derivatives landscape where traders may monetize upside attempts rather than chase them. If flows turn and spot holds firm, the same concentration can act as a magnet above price, particularly if dealers’ hedging needs shift as spot moves through strikes. Wall Street's increased Bitcoin ETF shares in Q4 2025 highlight strategic buying during price slides, hinting at a more complex market play. Using the Jan. 7–9 run rate as a simple scenario unit helps translate the story into forward-looking terms without treating flows as destiny. What investors watch next is less about any single number and more about persistence and price reaction. One check is whether redemptions stay concentrated in IBIT and FBTC or broaden across the complex, according to Barron’s coverage of the largest products’ role in major outflow sessions. Another is whether Bitcoin begins to absorb negative flow days without sharp downside follow-through. That can imply sellers are being met with bids away from the ETF channel. If the pattern becomes “outflows and fast declines,” that points to weak spot demand, with lower depth amplifying moves. That is consistent with the microstructure framing in the CryptoSlate note linked above. Rates sensitivity remains a parallel check because yield spikes tied to macro headlines have coincided with risk reduction across assets, according to MarketWatch’s reporting on the Treasury selloff tied to tariff-related uncertainty. There is also a practical caveat: ETF flows can be tactical and can reverse quickly. That includes rebalancing, tax positioning, or basis-driven strategies that do not reflect a long-term view. The market is operating under macro-first constraints, which can push allocators to adjust exposure rapidly as rates move. That is why streak length, the identity of the funds driving the moves, and the market’s ability to hold levels during negative prints tend to carry more information than any one day’s total. European leaders eye U.S. Treasurys as Greenland leverage, risking a one-month yield shock on Americans.

Advisors are building caps, rebalancing rules, and drawdown math while crypto execs sell regret avoidance as the new thesis. When your bank account becomes a tool of geopolitical coercion, the "rupture" at Davos changes everything you know about financial safety. NYSE is moving to "continuous" settlement, leaving traditional banking hours in the dust forever.

Tesla will probably sell its Optimus robots to the public by the end of next year, according to chief executive Elon Musk, who has said the carmaker’s fortunes will be increasingly dependent on humanoid machines. The company is already using some of the robots to do simple tasks in its factory, Mr Musk said Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He predicted Optimus would be “doing more complex tasks” by the end of 2026. Sales to the public will begin when Tesla is “confident that it’s very high reliability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is also very high”, Mr Musk said. The comments offer a more concrete timeline for the future business line, which Mr Musk sees as a key focus for Tesla going forward, alongside artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. The automaker’s core business of selling cars has suffered from a stale product lineup and the loss of EV incentives in the US, leading to two consecutive years of declining deliveries. While Mr Musk regularly talks up the potential of Optimus, he has been relatively vague about production timelines and targets. During a January 2025 earnings call, he said his “very rough guess” was that Tesla would start delivering Optimus robots to other companies in the second half of 2026. [ Michael O’Leary takes aim at ‘liar’ Donald Trump and ‘idiot’ Elon MuskOpens in new window ] Earlier this week, Mr Musk cautioned that initial production of Optimus and Tesla’s newest vehicle, the Cybercab, will be “agonizingly slow.” Tesla shares rose 1.7 per cent in late morning trading in New York. Mr Musk’s appearance in Davos came as a surprise after the world’s richest man was confirmed as a last-minute addition to Thursday’s schedule. He’d previously criticised the forum, calling the annual gathering of the world’s elite “boring” and slammed the WEF as a body that’s “increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don’t want”. He touched on a variety of topics in his conversation with BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, including data centres in space, robotaxis and power generation bottlenecks. Meanwhile, rocket maker SpaceX is lining up investment bankers at four Wall Street firms for leading roles on a blockbuster initial public offering, expected to be one of the largest new listings ever. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are being lined up for senior roles leading the IPO, according to people familiar with the matter. SpaceX executives have held meetings with bankers in recent weeks as the company prepares for an IPO as soon as this year. The group is currently conducting a sale of existing shares that would value it at around $800 billion (€681 billion). Other banks are also likely to land roles on the listing, the people said, cautioning that no final decisions had been taken and the situation could yet change. A SpaceX IPO would seek to raise tens of billions of dollars, probably surpassing Saudi Aramco’s $29 billion raise in 2019 to become the largest ever public listing. - Bloomberg From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elon Musk warns the U.S. could soon be producing more chips than we can turn on. And China doesn’t have the same issue

Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have. In a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models. “I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.” The U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech. Two massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American. Earlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators. “We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.” During his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve. Just as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks. “China’s growth in electricity is tremendous,” he said. According to the Global Energy Monitor’s Global Solar Power Tracker, China has nearly four times the amount of operational electricity from solar power than the U.S. Including potential power, China is expected to have 1,118,442 MWac, or electrical power output, from solar energy compared with the U.S.’s 237,947 MWac. “Solar is by far the biggest source of energy,” Musk said. Musk claimed powering the U.S. with solar energy would require very little space, only a 100-mile-by-100-mile square of solar fields needed to power the entire country. But U.S. policies have thwarted efforts to harness and deploy solar power. Despite urging grid operators to take action to increase production capacity, the Trump administration has opposed a pivot to solar energy, stripping subsidies for renewable energy sources it claimed “compromises our electric grid.” The White House did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Tariffs on solar equipment from Asia took effect in May, with import taxes as lofty as 3,500%, following a U.S. International Trade Commission determination that imports of solar modules and cells from Southeast Asian producers in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia were detrimental to U.S. manufacturers. “Unfortunately, in the U.S., the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high,” Musk said. “And that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high.”

The round was led by Bain Capital’s crypto division and Distributed Global. The funds of numerous prominent crypto investors also participated, including Katie Haun’s Haun Ventures and Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. Superstate builds infrastructure that moves traditional assets, like stocks and government securities, onto blockchain networks including Ethereum and Solana. In the last year, that trend has exploded from a curiosity on Wall Street to a near-standard practice. Industry titan BlackRock’s once-experimental BUIDL fund—a tokenized money market fund— debuted on Ethereum in 2024. It has since grown by several billion dollars and expanded to numerous other blockchains. Traditional finance mainstays have followed suit. Earlier this week, the New York Stock Exchange unveiled an on-chain platform it plans to soon use to facilitate the trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs. SuperState has been a go-to service for companies seeking to bring their assets on-chain—particularly those with crypto ties. It recently helped two Nasdaq-traded firms, Galaxy Digital and Solana Company, tokenize shares. Robert Leshner, Superstate’s CEO, recently told Decrypt he anticipates tokenized stocks will become particularly popular with retail investors once they realize they take those otherwise idle assets into crypto’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, and use them as collateral for all manner of loans. “You can take that money and buy a car or buy a house and leave the system entirely with it,” Leshner said at the time. “I think there’s going to be a lot of really happy investors.” Crypto-native companies have also jumped into tokenized stocks in recent months, seeking to compete with traditional finance firms over market share of the growing trend. Last month, Coinbase debuted a new product, Coinbase Tokenize, which will eventually allow customers to buy and sell on-chain stocks, and also enable institutions to tokenize assets themselves. A report out Wednesday from BlackRock emphasized that as crypto and traditional finance become increasingly intertwined, the financial opportunities within that intersection are becoming increasingly lucrative—and the race to capture that market, more competitive. “You have traditional securities and assets that are looking to be tokenized, and frankly, you have [digital] assets that [...] are making their way into the more traditional financial systems,” Jay Jacobs, the author of the BlackRock report, told Decrypt. “We believe in that convergence that does seem to be accelerating.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2026 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Despite promises that AI will create more jobs, 1.2 million jobs were actually slashed last year

Tech leaders like Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have described AI as a win-win for society; they make ambitious promises that the advanced tech will allow us to turbocharge the labor force, cure cancers, and create new “super well-paid, super interesting jobs” that didn’t exist before. But instead of feeling empowered, many workers fear their jobs are at risk of being automated—and the flood of layoffs in 2025 confirmed their suspicions. A staggering 1.2 million job cuts were announced last year, up 58% from the roughly 760,000 layoffs in 2024, according to a recent report from employment consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In fact, 2025 had the highest level of workforce reductions since 2020, and was neck-and-neck with the 2008 financial crisis, when 1.22 million roles were slashed. The biggest victims of last year’s headcount reduction bloodbath were federal workers. Extreme cost-cutting efforts from Elon Musk’s DOGE crippled entire agencies, including USAID, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. In total, about 308,000 government jobs were cut last year. However, the tech industry took the heaviest blow in the private sector. Last year, tech announced that about 154,000 roles would be slashed, a 15% increase from nearly 134,000 job cuts in 2024. The culprit? Rapid AI implementation—and the industry self-correcting from pandemic-era overhiring. In 2025, AI was responsible for 54,836 layoff plans overall; since 2023, the tech has been connected to 71,825 job cut announcements. “Technology has been pivoting to both developing and implementing artificial intelligence much more quickly than any other industry,” the report noted. “This coupled with over-hiring over the last decade created a wave of job loss in the industry.” In a time where the tech industry is growing fast and companies are vying to win the AI race, it might sound counterintuitive for trillion-dollar innovators to be offloading their talent. But CEOs have been open about how AI tools are taking over human skills, and they’re gearing up for more workforce changes. Microsoft let go of 6,000 employees last May, dishing out another round of 9,000 cuts in July. Meanwhile, its CEO Satya Nadella announced AI now writes 20% to 30% of the company’s code; technology that has proven to be so powerful, that the business is funding a $80 billion AI infrastructure drive. At the start of this past year, Meta also announced a 5% workforce reduction—impacting around 3,600 staffers—in an attempt to “move out low-performers faster,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. This came as the tech billionaire admitted AI was on the precipice of “effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer.” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy also admitted in a memo sent out to staffers last year that the business “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” Just a few months later, Reuters reported that Amazon plans to cut as many as 30,000 roles. While tech layoffs are nothing new, entry-level staffers—who are already facing challenges getting their careers off the ground—will likely feel the sting of AI-related workforce changes more than others. The percentage of employees between the ages of 21 and 25 has been cut in half at technology companies over the past two years, according to 2025 data from compensation management software business Pave. These Gen Z workers accounted for 15% of the workforce at large public tech firms in January 2023; but by August 2025, they only represented 6.8%. The situation isn’t pretty at big private tech companies, either—during that same time period, the proportion of early-career Gen Z employees dwindled from 9.3% to 6.8%. “If you’re 35 or 40 years old, you’re pretty established in your career, you have skills that you know cannot yet be disrupted by AI,” Matt Schulman, founder and CEO of Pave, told Fortune last year. “There’s still a lot of human judgment when you’re operating at the more senior level…If you’re a 22-year-old that used to be an Excel junkie or something, then that can be disrupted. So it’s almost a tale of two cities.”

Title: Musk Makes Surprise Appearance At Davos — Here’s What He Said About Greenland And Venezuela

ByMartina Di Licosa, Forbes Staff. Musk shared his hopes of dying on Mars, rehashed his futuristic vision for humanity, and joked about political tensions over U.S interest in Greenland and Venezuela during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday Morning, a surprise appearance that came after years of publicly disparaging the conference. “I’ve been asked a few times, do you want to die on Mars?” Musk shared during his conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, “And I’m like, yes, but just not on impact,” he added, garnering laughs from the crowd. Musk opened the talk by joking, “I heard about the formation of the peace summit, and I was like, ‘Is that P-I-E-C?’ … A little piece of Greenland, a little piece of Venezuela…all we want is a piece.” Fink focused on Musk’s space and AI-related ventures, leading Musk to reiterate his vision for building advanced humanoid robots, which he said “everyone on earth” is going to have When asked if he had any last words to share, Musk said, “I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future.” Musk’s inclusion in the Davos speaker roster was a last-minute surprise that came a day after President Trump’s speech. “There’s so many myths around Elon Musk,” said Fink towards the end of the conversation, publicly defending him, “He’s a great friend…and I’m totally inspired by what he has done.” Shortly before, Fink told the crowd he wanted to “humanize” Musk, garnering loud laughs. 850 of the world’s top CEOs and 400 top political leaders, including close to 65 heads of state and six G7 leaders, are attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, according to the organization. Musk joins a long list of notable speakers which, in recent days, has included President Donald Trump, President Macron of France, and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. Musk has been critical of the World Economic Forum for years. In 2023, he responded to a video of the event’s opening ceremony posted to Twitter with “How is WEF/Davos even a thing?” adding, “Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?” He went on to compare the summit to message board 4chan, which is known for being a platform for extremist points of view, joking, “There should be a game show: “4Chan or Davos, who said it?” The year prior, Musk publicly announced that he had declined an invitation to attend the conference, calling it “boring af.” One reason for his past distaste for the yearly summit could be its viewpoint on overpopulation, which the World Economic Forum’s official X account has called “a global challenge.” Musk, who has 14 children and is an advocate for boosting world population, responded to that post with, “Population collapse is an existential problem for humanity, not overpopulation!” This year, he has yet to post about Davos to his X profile.

Title: Elon Musk says at Davos that robots will one day outnumber people

Watch CBS News Updated on: January 22, 2026 / 2:18 PM EST / CBS News Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans. Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as "increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want." Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes "sustainable abundance" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis. "With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all," Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. "People often talk about solving global poverty — how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics." Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are "ubiquitous," which he said would unleash "an explosion in the global economy." "My prediction is there will be more robots than people," he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens. Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing "simple tasks in the factory." "By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public," Musk added. "That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability — you can basically ask it to do anything you like." The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing. Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving. "I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.," he told Fink. "And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully."

Title: Ethereum Holds $3,000 as Whales Accumulate: Key Resistance and Support Levels to Watch

Time Published: 2026-01-22T16:00:35Z

Ethereum (ETH) has stabilized above the $3,000 mark after a sharp sell-off earlier this week, as large holders increased their exposure during the dip. The recovery follows a volatile period in which ETH briefly fell below key technical levels, triggering liquidations and renewed caution across the broader crypto market. On January 22, Ethereum was trading around $3,003, up roughly 1.3% over 24 hours. The rebound came after ETH dropped nearly 13% between January 19 and 21, touching the $2,900 area for the first time in four weeks. That decline coincided with heightened macro uncertainty, ETF outflows, and the liquidation of over $480 million in bullish leveraged positions. On-chain data shows that large Ethereum holders accumulated aggressively during the recent downturn. Whale balances increased by roughly 290,000 ETH over a two-day period, representing purchases worth close to $360 million at current prices. This behavior suggests that some long-term investors view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity. However, other indicators point to a more cautious stance among experienced traders. The smart money index remains below its signal line, a level that has historically been crossed ahead of stronger upside moves. In previous instances, such confirmations preceded double-digit gains, but no such signal has emerged so far. Derivatives data support this wait-and-see approach. ETH perpetual futures funding rates briefly turned negative, indicating reduced confidence among leveraged traders. Options markets have also shown increased demand for downside protection after repeated rejections near the $3,400 level over the past two months. From a technical perspective, Ethereum is trading within a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. Momentum indicators show a bullish divergence, the relative strength index has formed higher lows while the price made lower lows between November and mid-January. This pattern suggests that selling pressure may be weakening, though confirmation is still lacking. The immediate level to watch on the upside is $3,050, a former support zone that ETH lost during the recent sell-off. A sustained daily close above this level would indicate short-term stabilization. Above that, the $3,146–$3,164 range represents a dense supply zone, where approximately 3.4 million ETH have been accumulated. This area is expected to act as a strong resistance.

Title: AST SpaceMobile Bets on Blue Origin to Send Up Its Next Giant Satellite

In the race to deliver satellite-to-phone connectivity, AST SpaceMobile has announced it’ll use Blue Origin’s massive rocket, New Glenn, to send up its latest satellite next month. The plan is to launch AST’s massive BlueBird 7 satellite, also known as FM2, sometime in “late February," the company said on Thursday. The news is notable because AST SpaceMobile is betting it can use New Glenn to carry up to eight BlueBird satellites in future flights. The increased capacity promises to help the Texas startup launch between 45 to 60 satellites by the end of 2026; enough for the company to supply continuous cell coverage from space to users through partners such as AT&T and Verizon. Thus far, New Glenn has only completed two successful flights, and only one landed the reusable booster. Blue Origin says the AST launch will happen "no earlier than late February"; rocket launches are routinely pushed back due to weather or testing-related setbacks. Tapping Blue Origin is a high-stakes gamble, but if successful, it would help AST compete with SpaceX, which is already delivering satellite-to-phone connectivity through its cellular Starlink system. SpaceX’s offering, available through T-Mobile as T-Satellite, can already power video calls, messaging, and select apps in cellular dead zones. But the bandwidth remains constrained. Meanwhile, AST is promising superior service with “peak speeds of 120Mbps per coverage cell,” thanks to each BlueBird satellite's massive antennas. (That said, SpaceX is planning its own upgrades, slated to debut in 2027.) The company’s second-generation BlueBird spans 2,400 square feet when the antenna is fully deployed. The first second-gen BlueBird flew up last month on a rocket from India’s space agency after multiple delays. AST investors are now hoping the company can successfully launch more BlueBirds through New Glenn on schedule. The company also told the Federal Communications Commission earlier this month: "AST SpaceMobile expects four more orbital launches by the end of Q1 2026, with additional launches occurring every one to two months on average to reach 45-60 satellites launched by the end of 2026." In a bit of irony, AST also uses SpaceX for satellite launches. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carried the first BlueBird satellites into orbit in September 2024, but New Glenn is expected to carry twice as much capacity as a Falcon 9 rocket.

Thursday, 22 Jan 2026 FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk attends the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 19, 2025. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo Jan 22 (Reuters) - Elon Musk ‌will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos for ‌the first time on Thursday, marking a striking reversal for ‌the billionaire who has publicly criticized the annual gathering of political and business elites. The world's richest person will join BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on a panel ‍scheduled for 1530 GMT, according to the ‍latest World Economic Forum program. Musk's ‌appearance at Davos comes as he continues to play a key ‍role ​in several global debates, including SpaceX's supply of satellite internet to conflict zones and public criticism over sexualized images ⁠generated by Grok, a chatbot developed by his ‌AI startup xAI. In the past few years, Musk has been one of the ⁠WEF's most ‍prominent critics, regularly criticizing the annual Davos gathering as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people. Musk has repeatedly mocked Davos on his social media ‍platform X, calling it "boring" and saying ‌the WEF is "an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want." The Tesla CEO's status as an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump has elevated his political clout, giving him an unusual degree of influence over policy discussions spanning technology, defense and global communications. Several of Musk's companies are of direct interest to governments, ‌including SpaceX, a major U.S. defense contractor whose Starlink network operates in conflict zones, and X, the social media platform he controls, where changes to ​moderation policies have drawn criticism over misinformation and hate speech.

Title: Bitcoin Price Not Following ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative Amid Greenland Tensions

Time Published: 2026-01-22T14:30:42Z

Reading time 3 minutes While the original Bitcoin whitepaper mostly focused on the crypto network as a peer-to-peer digital cash system for decentralized payments, the narrative around the worldâs largest and most valuable crypto asset has evolved into more of a store of value rather than a medium of exchange over the past decade. This is where the âdigital goldâ nickname originated, as some believe that bitcoin can act as an apolitical base money for the digital age with a monetary policy that was âset in stoneâ when the network first launched all the way back in 2009. As Larry Fink, the CEO of financial titan BlackRock, explained just last month, âBitcoin is an asset of fear . . . The long-term fundamental reason you own [bitcoin] is because of debasement.â While some view this digital gold narrative as a pivot from Bitcoinâs original design, the reality is that the systemâs creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was concerned with removing the trust required in central banks to not debase the currency in some of his earliest writings. This may all sound great in theory, but the reality is that bitcoin has routinely been unable to act like its analog sibling in times of global economic turmoil. For example, the bitcoin price suffered one of the worst crashes in its history when COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic in early March 2020. Over the past week, bitcoin has also dropped roughly 10% amid increasing tensions between the United States and Europe over control of Greenland and the selloff in the Japanese bond market. Last October, there was also a massive crash in the greater crypto market, including $16 billion in liquidations on leveraged positions, amid increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Of course, many of the liquidated positions were in crypto assets that are much more speculative and less credible than bitcoin. Meanwhile, gold is up roughly 5% over the past week. In fact, gold massively outperformed bitcoin in 2025, despite the precious metal supposedly being the less speculative and volatile asset of the two. While bitcoin has seen increased institutional adoption from the likes of Ivy League university endowments, nation states, and the largest asset manager in the world, the reality is that central banks, most notably China, still prefer real gold over its digital alternative. That said, the functional utility of bitcoin as something like digital gold still exists, as was shown by the recent flight from crypto exchanges in Iran to the base Bitcoin network. In addition to the local populations, there has been extensive reporting on nation-states like Iran and Venezuela using crypto to avoid economic sanctions imposed by the United States. While much of this activity is being usurped by stablecoins, these dollar-pegged tokens can also be easily frozen by their centralized issuers. Of course, the current inability of bitcoin to act as a safe-haven asset does not mean it is destined to fail to achieve its long-term goals. After bitcoin crashed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it went on to enjoy a 4,000% price rise to the new all-time high of around $125,000 hit last year. The price has since settled back down in the $90,000 area, and itâs unclear if the usual four-year cycles from the past will continue. The fact that it still moves like a tech stock in times of increased economic tension is a sign that it is still early days for bitcoin, despite its market cap now being measured in the trillions of dollars. However, it will eventually need to start acting more like the digital gold it’s touted to be if it wants to stand the test of time and become the basis of a new, digital monetary standard for the 21st century.

Crypto is now said to account for roughly 20% of the familyâs $6.8 billion fortune. Given that Bitcoin was created to circumvent traditional finance, what are we even doing here? Situations that expose centralization in supposedly decentralized exchanges have become par for the course in crypto. She warned of "extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence." Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas have enacted laws aimed at creating their own reserves. Turns out people might like to circumvent centralized financial infrastructure in times of political upheaval. Â©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC. All rights reserved.

Title: US applications for jobless benefits inch up last week to a still-low 200,000

The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 17 rose by 1,000 to 200,000, up from 199,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s fewer than the 207,000 new applications that analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. The Labor Department also recently reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed officials meet again next week, with most analysts and traders expecting central bank officials to keep the benchmark lending rate where it is. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,750 to 201,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 10 declined by 26,000 to 1.85 million, the government said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: What Is A Treasury Bond? Are They Going Tits-Up? Did Trump Chicken Out?

That President Donald J. Trump! In case you missed it, all weekend and as he was taking off for the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, he grunted and growled and pounded on his dumb web site about how he HAAAD TO HAVE GREENLAND, Denmark can’t protect it, how and why is it even theirs, he was going to tariff EU countries 10 percent and then 25 percent until they made Denmark give him Greenland, and tariff French wines 200 percent because President Macron refused to pay a billion-dollar bribe to be in Trump’s made-up peace club with Vlad Putin, Viktor Orban, and a pet psychic from Argentina. Whine, whine, whine!! Then while Trump was in the air, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was already in Switzerland, the US stock markets started going tits up, which is to say down, and then the Danish pension fund AkademikerPension confirmed that it would sell $100 million of US Treasury bonds out of concern over instability in the US. “It is not directly related to the ongoing rift between the [US] and Europe, but of course that didn’t make it more difficult to take the decision,” said Anders Schelde, the head investor, meaning that Trump’s hostile groanings and nonstop nonsensical threats made it pretty fucking easy, not to mention how the value of the dollar has been steadily plummeting since Trump took office. Poor Scott, what if the bond selloff snowballed like an Aspen orgy! Subscribe! Was Bessent’s spray-painted rubber muppet head ever in a tight spot then. He had to use his greasiest weasel words to explain to dumb reporters that once again Trump was full of shit about taking over Greenland and the threat of tariffs was just him trying to make some kind of meta-point, or something, and so everybody should just chill out, man. What BOND SELLOFF? “Denmark is irrelevant.” That smug little troll had to say some pointlessly dickish thing so all angry daddy would hear is how he really stuck it to that MEAN Denmark and all those UNFAIR JERKS at the lying Financial Times who LIED about the large asset managers they quoted who were considering dumping investments in the US from their portfolios. “I just think everyone needs to take a deep breath, do not listen to the media, who are hysterical, just like they were, just like you all were on April 2, and what happened, we had the best stock market recovery in history.” Ooh, he is so mad at those mean economists! Funds sell their bond holdings all the time, it’s no big deal. And he advised reporters on the sidelines, “It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax.” Relax! Trump is, of course, the only person in the room who flies into a blind, seething rage whenever he gets told “no” about anything, and constantly says things that he does not mean, because he either knows they are lies at the time or is so batshit crazy he himself can’t tell the difference any more, and we all know there are never any consequences ever. So just chill out, guys! So much for Trump doing the tariffs because they’ll be so great for the American economy that every Cletus with a GED will be able to use AI to supervise robots building robots in the robot factory. Talk about the bond market got Bessent spooked because bond yields are the price of the debt on America’s giant credit card. US Treasury bonds and shorter-term products, T-bills and Notes, have always been considered the standard of stable kinds of investments. A bond is a bet that in 10, 20, or 30 years, the US Treasury will still exist and be able to repay with a modest but stable interest. Bonds are a perfect investment for big savings and retirement funds, and domestic funds and banks hold about 70 percent of them. Then around 30 percent of US bonds are held by foreign governments, mostly Japan, the UK, and China. Which just fell to third place; they’d already been slowly selling off their holdings. So if the US Treasury yields go up, and bond prices go down, it means fewer investors betting on the US, and more of a risk of those bonds not paying off is priced in. With the Supreme Court possibly on the verge of letting Trump fire Lisa Cook and Jerome Powell on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (but probably not; the Federal Reserve is a “special case” because the Supreme Court Six likes its money) and effectively giving himself the power to set interest rates, or convert the Treasury’s holdings into Melania NFTs if he wants, you can see where long-term investors might be coming from with that worry. Sure, the Danish pension fund’s $100 million is a rounding error compared with America’s $30 trillion of debt. But investors, especially institutional ones, by definition hate uncertainty and are easily influenced by others, and a trickle and then stampede of investors selling their T-Bonds for Chinese bonds or mutual funds in Deutschemarks or Loonies could trigger a disaster. No wonder Bessent was all a-twitter to dismiss STUPID DENMARK THAT NOBODY CARES ABOUT. And so what do you know, Trump immediately backed down from the tariffs and sending US troops to mount a coup in Nuuk and start a war with NATO, saying that he would settle for “frameworks of a future deal” of some kind. And the US stock markets recovered. For now, anyway. They’ve been riding higher on demand for AI technology, infrastructure and chips and such, but according to a study from MIT, 95 percent of businesses have seen zero return on any of their investments in AI technology yet. It seems the only jobs AI robots have actually taken so far are “student who was supposed to write their own term paper,” “lawyer who was supposed to write their own briefs,” and “Adobe Photoshop child-undresser.” Up and up and up the markets now go! When will they crash, nobody really knows. [Wall Street Journal gift link / CNBC / Financial Times archive link] Share! Share Here is where you donate to keep Wonkette going forever!

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 17 rose by 1,000 to 200,000, up from 199,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

The Labor Department also recently reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed officials meet again next week, with most analysts and traders expecting central bank officials to keep the benchmark lending rate where it is. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,750 to 201,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 10 declined by 26,000 to 1.85 million, the government said.

Jan 22 (Reuters) - Elon Musk will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos for the first time on Thursday, marking a striking reversal for the billionaire who has publicly criticized the annual gathering of political and business elites. The world’s richest person will join BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on a panel scheduled for 1530 GMT, according to the latest World Economic Forum program. Musk’s appearance at Davos comes as he continues to play a key role in several global debates, including SpaceX’s supply of satellite internet to conflict zones and public criticism over sexualized images generated by Grok, a chatbot developed by his AI startup xAI. In the past few years, Musk has been one of the WEF’s most prominent critics, regularly criticizing the annual Davos gathering as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people. Musk has repeatedly mocked Davos on his social media platform X, calling it “boring” and saying the WEF is “an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don’t want.” The Tesla CEO’s status as an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump has elevated his political clout, giving him an unusual degree of influence over policy discussions spanning technology, defense and global communications. Several of Musk’s companies are of direct interest to governments, including SpaceX, a major U.S. defense contractor whose Starlink network operates in conflict zones, and X, the social media platform he controls, where changes to moderation policies have drawn criticism over misinformation and hate speech. (Reporting by Akash Sriram and Chandni Shah in Bengaluru; Editing by Alex Richardson and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Il 22 gennaio (Reuters) - Elon Musk parteciperà al World Economic Forum di Davos per la prima volta giovedì, segnando una sorprendente inversione di tendenza per il miliardario che ha pubblicamente criticato il raduno annuale delle élite politiche e commerciali. La persona più ricca del mondo si unirà all’amministratore delegato di BlackRock Larry Fink in un panel previsto per le 1530 GMT, secondo l’ultimo programma del World Economic Forum. L’apparizione di Musk a Davos arriva mentre continua a giocare un ruolo chiave in diversi dibattiti globali, tra cui la fornitura di Internet via satellite da parte di SpaceX alle zone di conflitto e le critiche pubbliche sulle immagini sessualizzate generate da Grok, un chatbot sviluppato dalla sua startup di intelligenza artificiale xAI. Negli ultimi anni, Musk è stato uno dei critici più importanti del WEF, criticando regolarmente il raduno annuale di Davos come elitario, non responsabile e disconnesso dalla gente comune. Musk ha ripetutamente deriso Davos sulla sua piattaforma di social media X, definendolo “noioso” e affermando che il WEF è “un governo mondiale non eletto che il popolo non ha mai chiesto e non vuole”. Lo status di alleato del Presidente degli Stati Uniti Donald Trump dell’amministratore delegato di Tesla ha elevato il suo peso politico, dandogli un insolito grado di influenza sulle discussioni politiche che riguardano la tecnologia, la difesa e le comunicazioni globali. Diverse aziende di Musk sono di interesse diretto per i governi, tra cui SpaceX, un importante appaltatore della difesa statunitense la cui rete Starlink opera in zone di conflitto, e X, la piattaforma di social media da lui controllata, dove le modifiche alle politiche di moderazione hanno attirato critiche per la disinformazione e l’incitamento all’odio.

Jensen Huang says AI and robotics offer a big opportunity When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has asserted that humanity is seeing one of the biggest revolutions in human history from AI and robotics. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Huang ruled out fears of an AI bubble by stating artificial intelligence reaches all sectors – it's not just a term used in tech businesses. "The spot price of rentals is going up. Not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs," Huang argued in an interview with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink (via The Register), referring to the sheer reach of AI. Artificial intelligence has already been seen to require ongoing investment across data centers, but energy infrastructure is also under higher-than-ever pressure and demand for skilled professionals is equally as high. Also speaking at Davos, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also ruled out an impending AI bubble, noting, "I think a telltale sign of if it's a bubble would be if all we’re talking about were the tech firms," he said, remarking AI's global and cross-industry reach. We're also seeing AI evolve into physical devices, with Huang stating that robotics provide a "once-in-a-generation" opportunity for European manufacturing. Huang also made positive remarks on AI's effects on the labor market – he believes that "tradecrafts" will be vital to the buildout of data centers and infrastructure. "This is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history and that's going to create a lot of jobs," he said. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Nadella's opinion differed, focusing instead on jobs affected by AI. He compared today's landscape to previous workforce trends, where prospective employees would have to prove competency across various office software like Word and Excel. AI upskilling is just the next phase of that. In short, it's clear that both leaders see AI and robotics drastically changing the way we see work, but quite how that translates into job creation or job losses is yet to be seen.

Title: Nvidia CEO expects AI to create more jobs for construction workers, electricians, plumbers, and many others

But human-AI collaboration will likely lift certain industries to new levels. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Artificial intelligence is expected to reshape the labor market by eliminating white-collar positions that do not require a lot of creativity or experience, but at the same time increase demand for blue-collar employees like construction workers, electricians, or plumbers, as AI infrastructure requires a massive built-out, according to Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia. That build-out spans many industries, so while some roles will vanish, others will flourish, reports Bloomberg. "This is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history that is going to create a lot of jobs," Huang said in a conversation with Laurence D. Fink, the head of BlackRock, at the World Economic Forum 2026. "We are going to have plumbers, electricians, construction and steel workers, network technicians, and people who install and fit out the equipment. In the United States we are seeing quite a significant boom in [these areas]: salaries have gone up, nearly doubled. We are talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building uh chip factories or computer factories or AI factories. We have a great shortage in that." However, the benefits of AI-driven growth are unevenly distributed across the labor market. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei once warned that AI-enabled automation could trigger a 'white-collar bloodbath,' which could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level office jobs. He noted that Anthropic's Claude AI has become particularly great at coding tasks, which could displace junior software developers and even erode portions of more senior software engineering work. Still, even Amodei believes the long-term gains from AI will outweigh the damage. Nonetheless, he warns that large-scale unemployment or underemployment remains a serious risk over the next five years. By contrast, Huang argues that some professions that can greatly benefit from both AI and human touch will actually increase demand for certain specialists, which will lift certain industries to new heights. "Ten years ago, one of the first professions that everybody thought was going to get wiped out was radiology," Huang noted. "The reason for that was that the first thing AI [gpy] superhuman in capability was computer vision, and one of the largest applications of computer vision is studying scans by radiologists. Well, 10 years later, it is true that AI has now completely permeated and diffused into every aspect of radiology. It is true that radiologists use AI to study scans. […] However, […] the number of radiologists have gone up. Is that because a lack of trust of or is that because the human interaction with the results of AI is a better outcome? […] The fact that they are able to study scans now infinitely fast allows them to spend more time with patients diagnosing their disease, interacting with the patients, interacting with other clinicians. […] As a result of that, the number of patients that the hospital can see has gone up, [driving revenues of hospitals]." In short, while AI can be a disaster for certain industries and professions, its impact on the quality of life will likely be comparable to the impact of electricity, automobiles, computers, broadband Internet, and telecommunications, all of which created many more professions and employment opportunities than they eliminated. However, one should note that the impact of AI can be compared to the cumulative impact of the aforementioned technologies combined in a very short time, so making exact predictions here is hardly a good business.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was heckled by former Vice President Al Gore during a World Economic Forum event in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, according to news coverage. Gore booed Lutnick while the Commerce secretary was giving a speech at an invite-only dinner event hosted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Mediaite reported on Wednesday. The report comes after Lutnick criticized Europe during his remarks, which prompted European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to suddenly leave the dinner event, multiple outlets reported. “I sat and listened to his remarks,” Gore said Wednesday in a statement provided to Mediaite. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane.” “And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others,” Gore continued. The WEF and a representative for Gore each did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. “During Secretary Lutnick’s three-minute speech, no one left hastily,” a Commerce Department representative told the DCNF in a statement on Wednesday. “Only one person booed, and it was Al Gore.” Moreover, Fox Business Network Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino wrote in a Wednesday X post that he was told by a “reliable” anonymous source that “at the dinner Lagarde walked out BEFORE [Lutnick’s] speech and was tired like everyone is at Davos.” Lutnick claimed in an op-ed published by the Financial Times on Tuesday that the Trump administration was “not going to Davos to uphold the status quo,” but instead was going “to confront it head-on.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” Lutnick wrote. “Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary, borders were not, and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good. That approach failed the US, crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well. It destroyed industries, weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind.” Gore suggested Wednesday that U.S. government policy should promote “regenerative agriculture” during a panel discussion at the WEF. Gore added that the U.S. needs “policies that [are] in recognition of the fact that governments around the world typically do subsidize farming, but don’t subsidize them in ways that incentivize them to go in the wrong direction, but incentivize them to go in the right direction.” Gore, the failed 2000 Democratic presidential nominee, is the cofounder and chairman of Generation Investment Management, and also the founder and chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a nonprofit organization which aims to combat the “climate crisis,” according to a biography on his website.

AI is all-consuming. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Jensen Huang has well and truly escaped gaming obscurity these days. The Nvidia CEO just took the stage at the World Economic Forum to talk about AI demand, bubbles, and the impact that artificial intelligence has on the job market now and into the future. Of course, being the man in charge of shipping billions of dollars of AI chips, he has a particularly positive take on the lot. Chatting to Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, who called Nvidia 'nuh-vidia' throughout the conversation, Huang had a few things to say about his booming business. "One good test on the AI bubble is to recognize that Nvidia now has now millions of Nvidia GPUs in the cloud. We're in every cloud. You know. We're used everywhere. "And if you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two generation old GPUs. The spot price of rentals are going up, and the reason for that is because the number of AI companies that are being created, the number of companies shifting their R&D budget." Nvidia's datacentre business, the topic of conversation here, has soared to many times its gaming revenue in recent years. It hit a record $51.2 billion through August to September last year. Gaming revenue during the same period was $4.3 billion. Though the demand for datacentre GPUs, such as upcoming Rubin chips, B100/200, and older chips like the H100/H200, do have a knock-on effect in gaming GPUs. Just look to the price of the RTX 5090—a more than capable card for smaller-scale AI deployment—which launched at $1,999 and is now selling for around $4,000+. Capacity for production is one factor in all of this, as when AI comes knocking for chips, be those GPUs or memory, there's only so much readily available at any one time. That's why we're seeing RAM prices skyrocket: AI demand outstrips supply and datacenter buildout is more valuable than availability for consumers.

In Huang's words, the fervour to buy more AI chips is "the largest infrastructure build out in human history." "That's going to create a lot of jobs," he says, citing skilled labor requirements for building out massive datacenters and increasing energy output to meet their demands. The impact of AI on the job market was one of the main topics of discussion through the talk. Huang, in no uncertain terms, suggested that AI will create a labour shortage, rather than take jobs from humans. He suggests one way to understand his way of thinking is to look beyond the tasks required to do a job and instead determining the purpose of a job. "Now, the easiest way to think about whether what is the impact of AI on a particular job is to understand what is the purpose of the job and what is the task of the job," Huang says. "If you just put a camera on the two of us and just watched us, you would probably think the two of us are typists, because I spend all of my time typing and and so if AI could automate so much word prediction and help us type, then we would be out of jobs. But obviously that's not our purpose. And so the question is, what is the purpose of your job? In the case of radiologists and nurses, it's to care for people, and that purpose is enhanced and made more productive because the task has been automated." I do think there are instances where this is not the case. When AI is entirely replacing the purpose of someone's job—or intrinsically changing it or shifting it further away—such as generative AI and artists or musicians, or closer to home, when AI tools are used to summarise news stories. When the AI is not owned or run by those professions affected by its use, it's not as often beneficial. Jobs may be created in some sectors, but similarly, jobs may move from other sectors entirely as it permeates into the wider market. Though Huang aims to keep things positive about AI, as you would expect from a CEO in his position signing off with a request for people to "get involved". And if anything is clear from this talk, according to these two, it wouldn't appear there's signs of slowing for the rapid buildout of AI. If anything, they suggest the large-scale investment in AI is only just beginning. 1. Best overall: AMD Radeon RX 9070 2. Best value: AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB 3. Best budget: Intel Arc B570 4.

Title: Is It Ethereum? BlackRock CEO Wants ‘One Blockchain’ For Tokenization
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-one-blockchain-blackrock-ceo/
Time Published: 2026-01-22T11:30:33Z
Full Content:
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink used the World Economic Forum stage to argue that tokenization needs to move from pilot programs to market plumbing and suggested that a shared blockchain standard could cut costs and even “reduce corruption,” a framing that immediately reignited the “which chain?” debate across crypto and specifically inside the Ethereum community. Fink didn’t name a network. But the combination of BlackRock’s onchain product footprint and its own research positioning makes Ethereum the most natural candidate for the “one common blockchain” he alluded to, even if he kept it implicit. Fink’s remarks, delivered in the language of infrastructure rather than crypto evangelism, leaned heavily on the operational case for digitized assets and interoperable settlement rails. “I think the movement towards tokenization, decimalization is necessary. It’s ironic that we see two emerging countries leading the world in the tokenization and digitization of their currency, that’s Brazil and India. I think we need to move very rapidly to doing that.” He then pushed the argument beyond payments and into capital markets: “We would be reducing fees, we would do more democratization by reducing more fees if we had all investments on a tokenized platform that can move from a tokenized money market fund to equities and bonds and back and forth.” The most provocative line was his call for standardization and the trade-off he implied comes with it. “[If] we have one common blockchain, we could reduce corruption. So I would argue that, yes, we have more dependencies on maybe one blockchain, which we could all talk about, but that being said, the activities are probably processed and more secure than ever before.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told the World Economic Forum he thinks the movement toward tokenization and digitization is necessary. We need to move very rapidly to doing that. With one common blockchain, we can reduce corruption. The “one common blockchain” Larry Fink referenced… https://t.co/sMMcg4oyN1 pic.twitter.com/VhRvuwCx00 — Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) January 22, 2026 In the abstract, “one common blockchain” could be read as a generic appeal for shared rails. In practice, BlackRock’s public-market crypto lineup and its tokenization work have concentrated around Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the ETF side, BlackRock’s flagship US spot products track bitcoin and ether — iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) — with ETHA launching in 2024 and now sitting in the center of the firm’s public-facing Ethereum exposure. On the tokenization side, BlackRock’s first tokenized fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), debuted on Ethereum via Securitize in March 2024, making Ethereum the original issuance network for what has become one of the market’s most closely watched institutional RWAs. While BUIDL has expanded across multiple networks over time, the key point for Fink’s “common blockchain” framing is that Ethereum has been BlackRock’s default starting point for public-chain issuance, a meaningful signal in a market where “standards” tend to follow whoever already has the deepest liquidity, the broadest integration surface, and the most conservative counterparties. The stronger tell came this week from BlackRock research rather than Davos soundbites. In its 2026 thematic outlook, BlackRock explicitly floats the idea of Ethereum as the infrastructure layer that collects the “toll” as tokenization scales. One slide asks: “Could Ethereum represent the ‘toll road’ to tokenization?” and adds that stablecoin adoption may be an early proxy for tokenization “in action,” with “blockchains like Ethereum” positioned to benefit. In the same section, BlackRock cites RWA data “as of 1/5/2026” and notes that “of tokenized assets 65%+ are on Ethereum,” underscoring the network’s lead in today’s tokenized-asset stack. At press time, ETH traded at $3,005. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Ray Dalio says CEOs concerned with a new rules-based order must accept that change is here for good

Good morning. Bumping into a leading European chief executive as he left the Congress Centre in Davos last night, I asked for a take on President Donald Trump’s speech. “I think we are just tuning out of all that noise a little. Did he say anything we didn’t expect? Was there anything new?” He continued: “We are focusing on our investments, on the AI transition, on security, on our three-to-five-year plans.” He had been at a dinner the night before and that was also “the mood of the table,” American and European. There is only so long you can maintain your risk antenna at 11 on the dial—even as a chief executive. I sense the mood here at Davos was respectful of Trump but resolute in its sense that there are other pressing issues to consider. Fortune hosted a series of panels at USA House, America’s “home base” for the duration of the World Economic Forum. We heard from Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan; Robin Vince, chief executive of BNY; Kellyanne Conway, former counsellor to the president; Mark Penn, CEO of Stagwell; and Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. Dalio, leaning on his decades of investment experience, urged business leaders to step back from the day-to-day and focus on the trends—conflict, indebted western governments, and major technology shifts. Trump may be playing in some of those lanes, but not in all of them. “But when you have the president of France saying that we are flirting with a world without rules, surely that will strike fear into leadership teams?” I asked him. Businesses need to sharpen up, he responded, and realize that change is with us for good. On the global stage, Europe can often appear to speak with one voice. But it is more nuanced than that. At our event at USA House, Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform party in the U.K., spoke about the reaction against globalization—a reaction he supports—and said that Trump was a success. Farage’s party is ahead in the polls. Yes, Farage did urge the president to remember the sacrifices of NATO members such as Denmark in U.S.-led conflicts in, for example, Afghanistan. And that self-determination for Greenland was the same as the American desire for freedom from Britain 250 years ago. Davos is about the nuances. It can be easy to ridicule. But for that CEO I bumped into, off to yet another dinner to discuss the transformational nature of AI, the hunt for the signal over the noise continues.—Kamal AhmedContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com President Trump, the dealmaker President Trump has taken a strong business approach to his second term, making unprecedented deals with private-sector leaders like Nvidia and institutions like Columbia University. One year into his presidency, Fortune digs deep into Trump’s record as “CEO-in-Chief.” Inside Eric Trump’s American Bitcoin Last spring, Eric Trump launched American Bitcoin, a mining venture he says is designed to help the U.S. become “the crypto capital of the world.” Fortune went inside the massive data center behind the operation to learn more about the newest arm of the Trump crypto empire.

Title: BlackRock Powers Bitcoin Investment For US Insurance Company, Here’s How
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-powers-bitcoin-us/
Time Published: 2026-01-22T10:00:41Z
Full Content:
BlackRock is enhancing Bitcoin investment by creating new avenues for institutional capital to access the asset within the US financial system. Instead of relying on traditional crypto markets, the firm channels Bitcoin-linked returns through the insurance sector. Through its partnership with Delaware Life Insurance Company, this approach integrates BTC exposure into a fixed index annuity framework, allowing insurers and policyholders to benefit from Bitcoin-linked returns without direct ownership of the asset. BlackRock is enabling Bitcoin exposure for a US insurance company by translating the volatile asset into a structure that fits the strict risk requirements of insurance products. In a statement on Tuesday, Delaware Life confirmed it has added the BlackRock US Equity Balanced Risk 12% Index to its fixed index annuity portfolio, formalizing the integration. This index connects digital assets with traditional insurance frameworks in a controlled way, making Bitcoin participation feasible within a risk-managed product. Instead of holding BTC directly, the index combines US equity exposure through the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF with Bitcoin exposure delivered via the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). IBIT, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF launched in January 2024, has grown to nearly $76 billion in assets under management, establishing it as the primary institutional gateway for BTC exposure in the US. Risk management is central to the index’s design. A 12% volatility target dynamically adjusts allocations to limit downside risk rather than pursue aggressive upside. This feature is essential for fixed index annuities, which are structured around principal protection. As a result, policyholders are insulated from direct losses on their initial investment while still participating in index-linked returns influenced by both equity and BTC performance. BlackRock’s role extends beyond access, supplying the ETF infrastructure and volatility-controlled framework that allows Bitcoin exposure to function within an insurance balance sheet. For Delaware Life, a subsidiary of Group 1001 Insurance Holdings, the partnership marks the first instance of a US insurer embedding Bitcoin exposure within a fixed index annuity. With Group 1001 overseeing approximately $76.4 billion in assets, the move reflects a strategic product expansion by a major insurance platform rather than an experimental initiative. Company leadership has positioned the offering as a response to growing demand from financial professionals seeking modern portfolio tools that remain compatible with retirement product risk constraints. From BlackRock’s standpoint, the structure expands Bitcoin’s presence in long-term savings and insurance markets without altering the conservative expectations of those products. By framing BTC as a return component within a tightly governed risk framework, BlackRock enables institutional adoption that aligns with regulatory standards, insurer capital requirements, and retirement planning logic. In effect, Bitcoin exposure is being packaged in a form insurers already understand and can distribute, quietly extending its reach into one of the most risk-controlled areas of finance.

Title: Bitcoin analysts predict ‘prolonged consolidation’ for BTC price

Time Published: 2026-01-22T09:39:23Z

Bitcoin’s onchain structure “remains fragile,” said Glassnode, warning of a prolonged consolidation period ahead for BTC price. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin (BTC) price could be in for another prolonged period of consolidation if key support levels are not reclaimed, a new analysis reveals. Key takeaways: Bitcoin is stuck between key cost-basis levels, predicting 2022-type consolidation unless key support levels are reclaimed. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $708.7 million, their fifth-largest since launch, signaling institutional caution. In the Jan. 21 edition of its regular newsletter, The Week Onchain, onchain data provider Glassnode confirmed key areas of resistance “constraining upside follow-through and keeping rallies vulnerable to distribution.” The BTC/USD pair has been oscillating within a wide range defined by the True Market Mean at $81,100 and the short-term holder (STH) cost-basis at $98,400. Related: Bitcoin eyes $90K as Trump sees crypto bill signing ‘very soon’ According to Glassnode, the recent rejection near the STH cost basis at $98,400 “mirrors the market structure observed in Q1 2022, where repeated failures to reclaim recent buyers’ cost basis prolonged consolidation.” The chart above shows that Bitcoin price spent the period between February 2022 and July 2022 trapped between the STH cost basis and the True Market mean before entering an extended bear market, bottoming around $15,000 in November 2022. Glassnode’s Entity-Adjusted UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), a metric that shows at which prices the current set of Bitcoin UTXOs were created, also revealed a wide and dense supply zone above $100,000 that has been gradually maturing into the long-term holder cohort. “This unresolved supply overhang remains a persistent source of sell pressure, likely to cap attempts above the $98.4K STH cost basis and the $100K level,” Glassnode wrote, adding The Bitcoin “Risk Index has climbed to 21, hovering just below the High Risk zone (25),” said private wealth manager Swissblock in a recent X post, adding: As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin must take out resistance at $98,000-$100,000 to revive the bull market cycle. On Wednesday, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows for a third consecutive day, totaling $708.7 million, according to data from CoinGlass. This marked their largest single-day exit in two months and the fifth-largest withdrawal from these investment products since their launch in January 2024, as shown in the chart below. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, posted the biggest outflows of $356.6 million. Fidelity's FBTC followed with $287.7 million, alongside four other funds that saw outflows. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a combined net outflow of $286.9 million on Wednesday across five funds. The last three days saw a “historic $1.58B exit from Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the charge in heavy institutional de-risking,” said analyst NekoZ in a reaction to the outflows. The selling pressure from spot BTC ETFs coincided with the rejection at $90,000 on Wednesday amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty, which increased the probability of rangebound price action or further downside if the support at $84,000 breaks.

Title: The world needs more plumbers and electricians

Unravelling the hype behind IT for creating useful CIO strategies. It may not have made the headlines when world leaders and CEOs met at the World Economic Forum at Davos, but the fireside chat between BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Nvidia president Jensen Huang, should worry everyone who has felt the trauma of having to book a tradesperson. Trying to get a quote for some plumbing or electrical work at home is as easy as using a metal detect to find a cache of gold on the beach. While the residents of Eastbourne this week munched on the news that their beach had washed up a container load of chips of the eating variety, it’s the demand for silicon chips, and, in particular those power hungry AI chips, that’ll eat up demand for tradespeople. Rather than economies experiencing job losses arising from greater use of AI in the workforce, Huang described the AI boom as the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history”, which he claimed would create a lot of jobs. “It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft,” he said. “Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don’t need to have a PhD in computer science to do so. Specifically Huang said the tech sector will need plumbers, electricians, network technicians, construction workers and steel workers, as well as the people who install and fit out the equipment. Mirroring the views presented by Microsoft’s Brad Smith in a March 2025 Fox Business article, Huang said there was a great shortage of such people. Where there’s the most demand, Huang said there will be a salary hike. “We’re talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories.” The latest AI hardware requires water cooling and more energy per rack than ever before. It needs a total rethink of how to power and cool datacentre facilities. In a recent Linkedin post, commercial real estate advisor Kris McGee, said datacentre are paying electricians $130 per hour, flying them on private jets to job sites and building “man camps” in rural Texas. London-based IT rollout specialist, Optrium recently estimated that electrical systems account for 40% to 45% of construction costs while cooling and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems represent about 15% to 20% of total expenses. The efficiency of these systems are vital to operating high-powered datacentres, such as those running demanding AI training and inference workloads. And keeping the electrical and cooling systems optimal means hiring highly skilled electricans, HVAC engineers and plumbers for water cooled systems. As demand for these skills increases with the escalation in AI datacentre builds, salaries of tradepeople will inevitably rise. The bottom line is that this demand will mean hiring a talented plumber or electrician is going become harder and will cost more.

Title: Elon Musk to take part in Davos panel discussion today

Elon Musk marked his last-minute Davos debut today with a critique of US solar tariffs and aggressive targets for Tesla, including humanoid robot sales next year, as well as flagging European approval for self-driving tech within weeks. After years of describing the World Economic Forum's annual meeting as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people, the world's richest man was interviewed by World Economic Forum interim co-chair Larry Fink. The BlackRock CEO expressed his admiration for Musk at the start of the wide-ranging discussion, which covered the future of robots and AI, the economic benefits of reusable rockets and Musk's childhood fascination with science fiction. Musk has become more prominent in recent years, driven by his proximity to US President Donald Trump and his stewardship of firms including Starlink-owner SpaceX, social media platform X and artificial intelligence startup, xAI. Breaking ranks with Trump on renewable energy, Musk said the US could produce enough solar power to meet all of its electricity needs, including booming demand from the proliferation of Big Tech's power-hungry data centres. "You could take a small corner of Utah, Nevada or New Mexico - a very small percentage of the area of the US - to generate all of the electricity that the US uses," he added. "Unfortunately, the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high and that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high," Musk said. Trump has been openly critical of clean energy sources while encouraging oil majors to drill more for oil and gas. His freeze on approvals for major onshore wind and solar projects has left thousands of megawatts of capacity in limbo at a critical time for the US as it rushes to secure enough power to meet soaring AI-driven requirements. The interview did not touch on other major geopolitical and economic themes that have dominated the forum this week, including Trump's ambitions for Greenland and Russia's war in Ukraine, focusing instead on technology and robotics. The pair joked about aliens, life on Mars and the "Terminator" film series. "We need to be very careful with robotics. We don't want to find ourselves in a James Cameron movie. Love his movies, but we don't want to be in Terminator, obviously," said Musk, referring to the fictional AI system from the "Terminator" films that becomes self-aware and turns on humanity. Among the highest profile executives speaking at the Swiss mountain resort this week, Musk predicted robots will eventually outnumber humans, leading to a huge economic boom, and joked about traveling to Mars. "People ask me do I want to die on Mars, and I'm like: 'yes, but not on impact','" he said towards the end of the 30-minute session, drawing laughter from the audience. His appearance at Davos comes as governments and regulators from Europe to Asia crackdown on sexually explicit content generated by his xAI chatbot Grok on X, launching probes, imposing bans and demanding safeguards, in a growing global push to curb illegal material.

Title: Elon Musk is a surprise addition to the Davos schedule

Davos, things just got exciting: Elon Musk will be in town. Musk wasn't expected to attend the World Economic Forum. But a day after President Donald Trump's speech, the Tesla and SpaceX chief has been added to the schedule. The world's richest man is now on the books for a session at 4:30 p.m. Swiss time on Thursday, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Flight data from ADS-B Exchange showed that Musk's private jet, a Gulfstream G650, took off from San Jose International Airport on Wednesday night local time and is traveling east. It's not yet clear whether Musk, who has been posting on X for the last several hours, is on the aircraft. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider. He's had a rocky public relationship with the organizers of Davos. In 2023, he made a post that questioned the need for the WEF. "Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?" he wrote at the time. Musk said in 2022 that he had declined an invitation to Davos, writing on social media that it was "boring AF." The WEF said at the time that he hadn't been invited since 2015. More recently, the billionaire has drawn attention for his public feud with Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, after the latter said he wasn't interested in installing Starlink on his airline's fleet due to several drawbacks. The WEF has not said what's on Musk's speaking agenda for Thursday. A WEF spokesperson confirmed that Musk is attending the event, adding that the forum has "an outstanding tech delegation attending this year's meeting — companies and individuals who are shaping the future of their industries."

Title: The critical hour of United Europe and our own “turning away” from Trump’s Davos, PASOK’s pointless infighting, bank profits and National Insurance

Time Published: 2026-01-22T07:40:23Z

Greetings. Europe—and in the broader sense the entire civilized Western world—is at this moment facing a major and unprecedented test. The outrageous demand by President Trump to conquer or “buy” a country such as Greenland, which in fact is under the “European umbrella” of an EU member state, Denmark, is not a matter for discussion or negotiation. It bears no resemblance to what happened in the dictatorship of Venezuela, nor to how the United States might influence the fall of a regime such as the mullahs of Iran. Consequently, this is the moment when Europeans—and of course we as well—must resist Trump in a united, methodical, and determined manner. Mitsotakis, partly because of timing and partly because of the common European stance, did not go to Davos and will fly straight to the Summit in Brussels for the major issue of Greenland. Athens’ forecast is that no one other than Orbán will sign Trump’s “peace pact,” Meloni included. One shot, three birds I should of course tell you that nevertheless in Athens they are studying very carefully Donald’s proposal for the so-called Peace Council, which is truly… astonishing. I am told that on Monday Gerapetritis will travel to New York and take part in the UN Security Council, which will assess the well-known Resolution 2803 that lays the foundations for the day after in Gaza. As a serious diplomatic source was telling me, Donald’s Council is essentially different from what is proposed in the UN Resolution, since the corresponding council envisaged there has a fixed term, whereas Donald’s is “open-ended” and may start with Gaza but deal with any other conflict field. Moreover, it is unclear where the funds requested as participation contributions will go, while it is foreseen that Trump would be president for life. “If this passes, it is a simultaneous ramming of the UN, NATO, and the European Union,” a serious diplomatic source told me, explaining the reluctance of Europeans—apart from Orbán—to capitulate to Trump’s idea. And I learn that Athens has already conveyed this message to Washington. The Ankara meeting is being finalized It is a matter of days before announcements regarding the Supreme Cooperation Council in Ankara, which will take place in the first half of February. I understand that the second week of February is more likely, specifically by February 13. Gerapetritis and Fidan have 4–5 dates and are examining them based on the schedules of Mitsotakis and Erdoğan, but Athens is sending the message that the SCC must take place. PASOK quarrels for nothing “A bad village, few houses,” says the proverb, and it seems to apply perfectly in the case of PASOK, where the top figures are at each other’s throats with leader Nikos, who is trying to tidy up the shop and is leaking various scenarios, such as the possibility of running in Athens A, where Geroulanos is elected. Geroulanos gathered about 2,000 people at his cake-cutting event at the Caravel, and when Androulakis appeared he was received with lukewarm applause. “All right, it’s not exactly his crowd,” a senior PASOK figure told me, acknowledging nonetheless that whenever the leader is outside his own mechanism he fails to excite. I also understand that there is some… difficulty in relations between Androulakis and Diamantopoulou. Anna feels stifled because the program “isn’t moving,” as the shop isn’t pulling, while Androulakis may now be “loading” her with any shortcomings for the poor reception of the programmatic positions in society. Thus the shop will limp along until the elections, where “we won’t get more than 11–12%,” as a PASOK MP was saying. A potluck congress Otherwise, various parties are holding congresses in the coming days. For example, the New Left, where things are generally rather sad, and also President Stefanos, who announced a congress for the Democracy Movement on February 7–8 at the Peace and Friendship Stadium (SEF). Let me tell you that Vice President Zakri is already opening a discussion about cooperation with Karystianou; I imagine it will also be raised at the congress. In any case, the congress is something of a potluck affair, and the president even asked SEF for a discount for the “Melina Mercouri” hall, while there was also coordination with Olympiacos BC, because the congress ends Sunday at noon and on Sunday at noon Olympiacos basketball plays Kolossos Rhodes. In any case, the party is not providing buses or hotels for cadres coming from the provinces, and generally a proposal has been made as to whether they can… be hosted by friends from Athens. Rain–schools–Aris Now, regarding yesterday’s severe bad weather and rainfall in Attica, which manifested mainly from 5 p.m. onwards, I would say the following. Initially, in the morning, because the phenomena were mild, we all thought that closing the schools was an excessive reaction by the Region. In the end, it wasn’t so, because from early afternoon the weather worsened and the rain that fell was probably one of the heaviest in the history of Attica, during which unfortunately an unlucky woman lost her life. It is estimated that daily the Region of Attica alone transports about 32,000 students with 1,900 routes of public schools, special education, etc. Closed schools “lighten” traffic in Attica by about 7,000 cars per day, studies say. Therefore, the… “scientists” who started criticism early on social media (Aris Spiliotopoulos, Antonaros, etc.) simply rushed. What does Aris with the mustache, who butchers everything and knows everything—from the weather to President Maria—tell you? February 4 for the VOAK We were saying a few days ago about the official start of the VOAK concession within the first half of February. Although there were thoughts to do it earlier, the date has now been definitively locked for February 4. The duration of the concession contract is 35 years, and GEK TERNA has undertaken the largest part of the VOAK, the Chania–Heraklion section. In view of further strengthening the company’s concessions portfolio, Piraeus Securities proceeded with a significant upgrade of its investment recommendation, raising the target price of the share to €40 from €31 previously, following Santander, which a few days ago raised the bar to €49. The share closed yesterday at €30.84. Meetings of A. Exarchou with Eric Trump and the Saudi Minister of Investment Highly active at the Davos Forum was the President and CEO of the AKTOR Group, Alexandros Exarchou, as he had a series of important meetings of business interest. Among others, he met with the Saudi Minister of Investment, Khalid A. Al-Falih, with whom potential opportunities for investments in the energy sector were discussed, and with the Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, Eric Trump, with whom he discussed investment opportunities and the broader prospects of the Greek economy. Today, A. Exarchou is participating in a panel with the U.S. Ambassador K. Guilfoyle, the Minister of Energy of Romania, and Deputy Foreign Minister H. Theocharis. Yesterday, during a discussion with businessman, author, and Forbes columnist Rhett Power, the head of the AKTOR Group said that Europe must decide what it ultimately wants to be: a real federation with common interests, a common army, and central authority, or a loose union of states. It needs to decide, he said, on its role and identity, otherwise it risks being sidelined in global geopolitical and economic realignments. Europe, he stressed, over-regulates everything, resulting in everything becoming more expensive, creating a huge competitiveness problem for European businesses, and squeezing citizens’ disposable income. A Greek woman in the top ranks of PepsiCo The latest major changes in the executive pyramid of the multinational group PepsiCo have brought Athina Kanioura to the top of Latin America. The Greek manager took over as CEO of Latin America Foods—one of the company’s strongest and fastest-growing business segments—while at the same time retaining the strategic role she has held since 2020 as Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer for the entire Group. For those who don’t know her: before “landing” at PepsiCo, A. Kanioura had built a long and steadily rising career at Accenture, starting from the Greek subsidiary, continuing in London, and reaching the top of global leadership in Analytics & AI. She herself, via LinkedIn, spoke of a “legacy of success” she is inheriting from Paula Santilli, of a market that remains a growth engine, and of a culture of innovation and speed that—she says—she can leverage to “unlock new potential.” The recent changes in the multinational’s executive pyramid also “touched” the Greek subsidiary, PepsiCo Hellas, where the new head is Georgian Konstantin Merkviladze. National Insurance opens its cards Today we will have the unveiling of the new strategy of National Insurance. The group’s CEO, Dimitris Mazarakis, and the rest of the management will speak to journalists about the framework of the goals and strategic priorities of the insurer after its acquisition by Piraeus Bank. We say framework, because the Business Plan 2026–2030, which will set out the strategy for the next five years, will officially be presented next March. However, some things are already known, with the main one being the ambitious target of achieving €1.5 billion in premiums by 2030 and gradually regaining first place in all sectors except motor insurance. For 2026, this is characterized to some extent as a transition and preparation year for the full development of (co)operations with Piraeus Bank, as well as infrastructure issues such as accelerating digitization, technological support, etc. At the operational level, a major issue is repositioning in the Health sector and the further development of collaborations created due to Piraeus Bank, such as with Errikos Dynan, the utilization of the banking network, strengthening and expanding sales networks in Greece, and more. Naturally, there are many other issues the management will be called upon to address, some extremely difficult and not exclusively in its hands, with perhaps the foremost being how the issue of increases in premiums and healthcare costs will be handled, and what will happen in the future with the two partnerships that Piraeus Bank maintains with two well-known insurance companies. Banks rush to announce results (+dividend) It may not be a coincidence but rather a symptom of banks’ haste to announce their results and the dividend for fiscal year 2025 as early as possible. Piraeus Bank and Eurobank will announce their 2025 financial results on February 26, 2026, a date that exemplifies the trend that has formed in our market toward the earliest possible disclosure of financial data. Overall, the four systemic banks will present total net profits of approximately €4.7 billion for 2025, despite pressure from the reduction of ECB interest rates. Already from the nine-month period, profits had reached €3.5 billion, with an increase in the loan portfolio of €10.5 billion. Bank of America estimates that Eurobank closed the year with net profits of €1.36 billion, while for Piraeus the estimates amount to €890 million. Early announcement allows faster approval by the SSM for dividend distribution and potentially buyback programs. The two banks are planning high payout ratios (Eurobank 50%, Piraeus 35% gradually rising to 50%), with a total dividend yield exceeding 7–8% for 2026–2027. With strong capital adequacy, NPE ratios below 3%, and aggressive expansion plans through acquisitions that enrich revenue sources, banks are trying to justify the investment fever on the Stock Exchange. Free shares A program for the free allocation of shares to administrative and executive staff was approved by Ergon Foods, concerning the distribution of up to 11.69 million preferred non-voting shares, with a nominal value of €0.10, with an annual privilege between €3,000 and €5,000 per beneficiary, deriving from the capitalization of retained earnings. The program runs until 30/06/2026 and the Board of Directors will determine the beneficiaries, the terms of allocation, and the holding obligation. The timing is not accidental. It comes a few months after the entry of the Halcyon fund under Eleni Bathianaki, aiming to “tie” executives to the international expansion plan described to newmoney by co-founder Thomas Douzis: from new Ergon House locations and foreign markets to the ambition of building a Mediterranean brand with global reach. In practice, therefore, the program translates into a tool for participation in future added value and a move that shows Ergon no longer operates with the logic of a “family business,” but under the terms of a growth company playing on an international field. Kousta’s entry into LNG Danaos Corp’s investment in the Alaska LNG liquefied natural gas project marks a shift in the company’s strategy beyond traditional container shipping. With the $50 million investment, it deploys part of the approximately $1 billion in cash it accumulated over the past three years, moving capital from a market characterized by intense volatility such as containers to an energy transportation market with greater revenue stability. Danaos is not investing in shares but is envisaged as a preferred vessel provider for at least six LNG carriers, leveraging its expertise in maritime transport of large cargoes. This implies that Danaos will build or manage at least six specialized vessels for this LNG transport. In this way, it creates a new revenue stream not directly linked to its core activity, reducing exposure to fluctuations in container freight rates. At the same time, the investment aligns with the United States, which is promoting domestic LNG production as a strategic energy resource. Danaos enters a project with strong political backing and commercial commitments in Asia, thus reducing regulatory and geopolitical risk. Simultaneously with its entry into cargo vessels—capesize bulkers—Danaos shows that it wants to diversify its revenue sources. The strategic move of Olympic Shipping & Management The recent chartering of the VLCC supertankers Olympic Laurel and Olympic Trophy to Shell for three years by Onassis-controlled Olympic Shipping & Management is not merely a commercial agreement but a clear statement to the global energy market. With scrubber-fitted VLCCs earning up to $122,600/day in spot rates, the company secures stable premium revenues while simultaneously reducing exposure to market volatility. The Greek company exploits these realignments, strategically securing interests with leading oil companies, while the choice of long-term contracts places it at the heart of energy flows between the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Olympic Shipping & Management leverages technology, experience, and timing to shape balances in the oil market. Greek shipping, continuing the tradition of Aristotle Onassis, maintains control over critical nodes of international energy and sends the message that it remains a protagonist even in periods of intense instability. At the same time, Aramco Trading chartered Maria Angelicoussis’ “Maran Mars” for three years at $52,000/day, and Mitsui OSK Lines chartered Angeliki Frangou’s “Nave Allegro” for five years at $44,000/day. The moral of the story is that Greek-owned shipping achieves higher charter rates and more favorable terms compared to major Middle Eastern and Asian players, confirming its strategic superiority. Oikonomou strategically locks in newbuilds Giorgos Oikonomou appears to be rewriting his playbook in the tanker sector with his latest move. The TMS Group acquired two newbuild suezmax tankers, which had initially been reserved for John Fredriksen and Seatankers. Financial analysts note that this is not merely a deal but a strategic coup. TMS is essentially “strolling” into a market where slots for newbuildings are scarce and demand has surged due to geopolitical realignments—more specifically, trade flows of Russian oil to India and China. With these two new orders, TMS increases its suezmax fleet to six vessels, strengthening its presence in a global fleet that traditionally yields high returns on difficult routes, such as transporting crude from Northern Russia and Black Sea ports. This move gains strategic depth when viewed as part of a broader trend of Greek shipowners “snapping up” new tanker order slots. Oikonomou essentially capitalized on a window of opportunity left by Seatankers, showing that TMS has the flexibility and capital to move quickly, even when major shipping deals are overturned. The story also has a geopolitical flavor. The dependence of suezmaxes on Russian flows, combined with the potential restriction of the “shadow fleet,” opens opportunities for “mainstream” shipowners like Oikonomou. Aktor at a new high and the rally in refineries Aktor is in a favorable phase, recording three consecutive positive sessions, resulting in the share reaching an important milestone and closing at €10.16. At the same time, the group’s market capitalization now exceeds €2 billion. Refineries took center stage yesterday, with buyers flocking en masse to Motor Oil and HELLENiQ ENERGY, in the wake of a report published by Pantelakis Securities on the sector. MOH recorded a jump of 4.3%, returned above €31, and is within striking distance of the all-time high of €31.48 recorded on December 22, 2025. Similarly, HELLENiQ ENERGY rose by 2.8% and moved above €8.7, with the next target being the seven-year highs of €9. Pantelakis set the bar at €40 for Motor Oil and €10 for HELLENiQ ENERGY, with an overweight recommendation for both refineries. Cenergy Holdings also recorded six consecutive gains, extending its all-time record and closing at €17.6. KRI-KRI’s bet in Aspropyrgos The small dairy company from Serres, KRI-KRI, has grown. It is now worth €658 million, that is, 24% more than around this time last year. Its weapon is one word: “exports.” Hence KRI-KRI’s next investment in creating a logistics center in Aspropyrgos, Attica, is only natural. Today, nearly 7 out of every 10 euros that KRI-KRI earns from dairy products come from international markets. The company closed 2025 with turnover of around €300 million. Aspropyrgos, apart from bordering Piraeus, has now established itself as the country’s absolute logistics hub, with rental prices reaching €5.8/sq.m. per month (+19% over five years) and land prices at €120,000–130,000 per stremma. Major retail companies (IKEA, Sklavenitis, Galaxias, METRO, etc.) are investing hundreds of millions in the area. For KRI-KRI, the Aspropyrgos center will function as a bridge: on the one hand serving the Attica market, where yogurt sales increased by 5.8%, and on the other facilitating export logistics via Piraeus. Naturally, all this is accompanied by increased production capacity through the major €52.2 million investment at the Serres factory. The changing of the guard and compensation A “changing of the guard” took place at EBIOP-TEMBO, the electrical equipment manufacturing company based in Chalkida and controlled by Siemens. At the end of October, the German CEO at the time, Dennis Julian Schubert, resigned and was replaced by fellow German Felix-Alfred Uebelhack, a Siemens Group executive, seconded to the company by shareholder Siemens A.E. to cover the CEO position effective from 01.11.2025. What is of interest now is the projected remuneration of the new CEO. Based on the relevant terms of the contract with Siemens for the secondment of this executive, the duration is three years, from 15.10.2025 to 14.10.2028, with the possibility of extension. The gross annual fixed remuneration during the secondment amounts to €129,268, while the gross annual variable remuneration in case of 100% target achievement—i.e., the bonus—is €32,317. The “other net annual allowances (housing, family, etc.)” reach €19,500, in addition to any other provided benefits “according to the contract concluded between him and Siemens AG.” There is also a “billing” clause according to which billing is done monthly, with a 5% profit margin in addition to the cost of the executive, excluding costs stipulated in the contract to be directly covered by the company. €3.8 billion absorbed in 12 minutes! Europe’s stock market is “thirsty” for defense stocks. Twelve minutes. That was the time it took for the €3.8 billion IPO of the Czech defense industry Czechoslovak Group (CSG) to be fully subscribed by institutional investors. Not hours, not days—twelve minutes that reveal much about Europe’s new geopolitical reality. CSG’s IPO in Amsterdam values the company at €25 billion. Controlled by 33-year-old billionaire Michal Strnad, CSG entered the market with impressive figures: revenues of €4.5 billion in the first nine months of 2025 (+82% year-on-year), an EBITDA margin of 26.4%, and… an order backlog of €14 billion. It is the second-largest producer of medium- and large-caliber ammunition in Europe, and the world’s largest in small caliber. The participation of cornerstone investors—Artisan Partners, BlackRock, and Qatar’s Al-Rayyan—with total commitments of €900 million set the tone for the new era. The STOXX Europe Targeted Defence index is again flirting with record highs, five times above levels of three years ago. Europe is “rearming,” and CSG—with 68% of its revenues from NATO countries and 26% from Ukraine—stands exactly at the epicenter of this upheaval. Trump predicts a stock triumph; Americans can’t afford natural gas In just two days, natural gas prices in America rose by +60%. One could attribute the explosive increase to the “Arctic freeze” that swept across the U.S. Perhaps, however, this explanation alone is not sufficient. Most Wall Street hedge fund managers had increased their short positions in natural gas, betting on lower prices due to the mild winter. The sudden change in weather boosted heating demand and triggered a classic short squeeze, with optimistic speculators hurriedly closing their positions, accelerating the rise in natural gas prices. There is, however, another detail, and it concerns liquefied natural gas infrastructure on the other side of the Atlantic. The U.S. has now evolved into a leading exporter of LNG, supplying Europe after exerting intense pressure on it to disengage from Russian gas. But when domestic inventories are strained by extreme weather conditions, arbitrage is created between domestic consumption and export contracts. The messages from this chaotic situation are many. First and foremost, storage capacity. Storage capacity is the new gold of the energy map. Second, climate change—which Trump denies—yet produces extreme weather conditions and turns energy commodities into a game of Russian roulette. Markets no longer price average demand, but extreme events. Explore related questions

Title: Microsoft CEO urges AI developers “to get to a point where we are using this to do something useful,” or “lose even the social permission...to generate these tokens”

Nadella tells Davos that AI’s legitimacy hinges on making people's lives better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is concerned that if artificial intelligence doesn’t start delivering real, measurable benefits to society, people will be fed up with it and its price, ending its current form of existence. The Davos stage is an odd venue and audience to preach societal good over other goods, but it certainly helped his comments stand out. AI developers "have to get to a point where we are using this to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries. Otherwise, I don't think this makes much sense," Nadella explained during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "We will quickly lose even the social permission to take something like energy, which is a scarce resource, and use it to generate these tokens, if these tokens are not improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, private sector competitiveness, across all sectors, small and large." The Davos crowd, used to a more digital transformation cheerleading role, sounded a little confused. But the discussion also shows how the AI hype train is both an illusion and real. Nadella should know what he's talking about. Microsoft is one of the biggest drivers of the current AI boom, with tens of billions of dollars invested in OpenAI, its own Copilot suite baked into productivity tools, and a seat at nearly every major AI policy table. But his message at Davos was that leadership now demands a reckoning – not just about how smart or useful AI tools are in theory, but whether they’re helping people in schools, clinics, small businesses, and city governments. That’s not an abstract moral argument. It’s an infrastructure one. AI’s growth has been driven by immense computational muscle, which means it’s also driven by massive energy use. Training today's biggest models consumes as much electricity as some small countries consume in a year. And inference, when you run the model on your phone or desktop to answer a question or generate a response, adds to that cost every second it runs. AI doesn’t just use servers; it fuels an ever-expanding footprint of data centers, water-cooled systems, and grid-straining workloads. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Nadella’s social permission phrase gets to the heart of what might be next. Until now, the public has broadly accepted that cloud-based tech companies can use resources in exchange for productivity, entertainment, or convenience. But that goodwill isn’t guaranteed. If AI begins to look like a wasteful luxury, delivering novelty rather than necessity, citizens and governments may start to push back. During the session, Larry Fink asked whether all this productivity talk would mean fewer jobs, and Nadella didn’t dismiss the concern. But he argued that AI’s potential lies in amplifying what people can do. But this moment is different from past tech inflection points. The sheer scale of AI's appetite. Cloud computing scaled gradually. Smartphones had physical limits. But AI can grow as fast as the models and capital behind it allow. That’s why Nadella’s call to focus on outcomes comes off as cautious as well as pragmatic. Nadella’s message was simple but sharp: we are nearing the edge of public tolerance for black-box systems powered by opaque amounts of energy, with unclear societal benefits. And maybe we should all be asking harder questions when the next shiny AI tool drops: Does this help me? Does it help someone? Or is it just burning energy to generate yet another token?

Title: India’s wealth boom sparks M&A frenzy as banks chase affluent clients

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. MUMBAI: India’s wealth management industry is scrambling to scale as a growing pool of household financial wealth remains underserved. Of the at least $1.1 trillion held by the country’s top households, defined as those with annual incomes of $25,000 or more, at the end of FY24, only about $0.7 trillion was addressed by registered wealth managers, according to a 2025 Deloitte report. This leaves an estimated $0.4 trillion in unmet demand. This pool of household wealth is being serviced by a limited universe of private wealth managers, financial advisers, mutual fund distributors and registered investment advisers. Specialized wealth managers are only able to meet 11% of the demands of the country's top 1% households, as per a Bernstein report from 2025. These include listed platforms like 360 One Wealth, Anand Rathi Wealth, Nuvama Wealth, as well as private players like Kotak Wealth, Julius Baer India. Waterfield Advisors, and Avendus Wealth. Most high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth demand, Bernstein noted, remains either self-managed, handled by accountants, or serviced by domestic banks and brokers offering limited customization, as well as independent advisers that lack scale. The imbalance has turned wealth management into one of the country’s most active dealmaking sectors, drawing global banks, foreign asset managers and domestic lenders eager to secure access to India’s affluent and ultra-high-net-worth clients. “The velocity at which investable capital is forming in India has surpassed the speed at which many institutions can build organic advisory capability," said Feroze Azeez, joint CEO of Anand Rathi Wealth. The scarcity of established platforms, he said, is drawing foreign capital seeking direct access to Indian wealth while pushing domestic banks to race for specialized capabilities. India is now among the world’s fastest-growing wealth markets, with wealth creation accelerating across entrepreneurs, professionals and salaried classes, said Prakash Bulusu, joint CEO of IIFL Capital. “This expanding client base demands personalized investment advisory services…Those rare firms offering all services are in focus." The opportunity is only expected to widen. Bernstein estimates that the country’s serviceable wealth is expected to triple from $3 trillion in FY25 to $9 trillion by FY35. Firms race for scaleSeveral international and domestic banks, and asset managers are moving quickly to capture a share of this growth. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and Emirates NBD Bank, which recently received Reserve Bank of India approval to set up wholly owned subsidiaries, are still deciding whether to build organically or acquire existing platforms, according to two people aware of the matter. Jefferies is also looking to enter India’s mutual fund space through an organic buildout, a third person said. SMBC, Emirates NBD did not respond to emailed queries, while a Jefferies spokesperson refused to comment. Domestic players are also reassessing growth strategies. Mint reported earlier this month that investment bank DAM Capital is preparing for a potential foray into wealth management and alternative investment funds. Some deals are already delivering shortcuts to scale. Boston-based State Street Corp. recently invested ₹580 crore in fintech platform Groww’s asset management business. Last month, Mizuho Financial Group agreed to acquire KKR’s majority stake in Avendus Capital, giving the Japanese lender immediate access to the firm’s ultra-high-net-worth client relationships. Deutsche Bank AG’s India retail and wealth management business, valued at $2.5 billion, has reportedly drawn binding bids from Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Federal Bank Ltd. Affluence fuels the rushThe primary driver of this deal activity is the rise of India's affluent class, industry experts explained. They said that the number of high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals in India has surged in recent years, fuelling demand for sophisticated wealth management services. In 2025, India had four of the top 10 cities globally for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, according to wealth intelligence firm Altrata – the financial hub of Mumbai; Bengaluru and Hyderabad, centres for IT and business services; and the national capital, Delhi. The Mercedes-Benz Hurun India Wealth Report 2025 noted nearly a 200% rise in India’s millionaire households. It estimated that India now has 871,700 households with net worth above ₹8.5 crore, or approximately $1 million, almost double the 2021 figure of 458,000, representing 0.31% of all households. Between 2017 and 2025, million-dollar households grew 45%, though only a small share entered ultra-rich categories. The report also found that 83% of respondents remained confident about India’s economic growth over the next three years. The surge in India mirrors a global trend. In 2025, M&A targeting investment and wealth management firms surged as firms repositioned for rising demand in alternatives and a multi-trillion-dollar generational wealth transfer, with deal volumes at record highs globally. As per Deloitte 2026 Investment Management Outlook report, deal volume in the first half of 2025 jumped 46% year-on-year, making it the most active first half in more than a decade. As in 2023, a substantial share of these transactions targeted wealth management and investment advisory firms. “The continued expansion of alternative investment offerings helps underscore the vital role wealth management firms can play in helping high-net-worth individuals and retail investors make informed investment decisions," the same report said. “Additionally, with trillions of dollars set to shift between generations over the coming decades, many investment firms are taking notice and positioning themselves accordingly." India’s current wave of deals builds on a key consolidation in early 2025, when 360 ONE WAM Ltd acquired UBS Group AG’s onshore India wealth management business, consolidating roughly 80 family office relationships alongside its assets under management. UBS retained a minority stake rather than continuing independently.

BlackRock Inc., which ended its DSP partnership in 2018, re-entered in 2023 through a joint venture with Jio Financial Services Ltd, with chairman Larry Fink calling it a “major step" in expanding the firm’s global presence. Jio BlackRock received final registration and approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India to begin operations in May 2025. Looking ahead, the trend shows no signs of slowing. Deloitte expects continued consolidation through 2026, driven by the integration of public and private market products and competition for scarce wealth-management scale.

As the Company pushes Neutron to the limits and beyond to qualify its systems and structures for launch, qualification testing of the Stage 1 tank overnight resulted in a rupture during a hydrostatic pressure trial. Testing failures are not uncommon during qualification testing. We intentionally test structures to their limits to validate structural integrity and safety margins to ensure the robust requirements for a successful launch can be comfortably met. There was no significant damage to the test structure or facilities, the next Stage 1 tank is already in production, and Neutron’s development campaign continues while the team assesses today’s test outcome.The team is reviewing the Stage 1 test data, which will determine the extent of the impact to Neutron’s launch schedule. The Company intends to provide an update on the Neutron schedule during its 2025 Q4 earnings call in February.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG PublishedÂ Jan 22, 2026, 07:42 AM UpdatedÂ Jan 23, 2026, 03:02 PM DAVOS, Switzerland - As artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to upend job markets in countries around the world, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang brushed off longer-term concerns and made the case that skilled vocational workers are seeing increasing demand now. Plumbers, electricians and construction workers are going to be able to command âsix-figure salariesâ, thanks to demand to build data centres that run and train AI, he said in an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 21. The technology will require one of the biggest infrastructure build-outs in history, with trillions of dollars in new investment, Mr Huang said. âWeâre seeing quite a significant boom in this area. Salaries have gone up nearly double,â he said. âEverybody should be able to make a great living. You donât need to have a PhD in computer science to do so.â Mr Huangâs comments echo remarks made at Davos on Jan 20 by Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp, who praised workers with âvocational trainingâ and said AI would create more local jobs and largely eliminate the need for mass immigration. Coreweave CEO Michael Intrator also touched on the âphysicalityâ of the AI boom at a panel later on Jan 21, describing the need for growing numbers of plumbers, electricians and carpenters.Â Nvidia, the leading maker of chips that help power and run the latest AI models, has benefited from the huge rush to build data centres. The company is on track to generate almost US$200 billion (S$256.7 billion) in data centre chip sales for 2025, according to an average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. To date, the bulk of its revenue comes from the biggest data centre builders â Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, Alphabet â but it is striking deals with a growing number of smaller data centre operators. Tech firms have committed to spending a combined US$500 billion in data centre leases in the coming years. AIâs impact on the job market is already being felt. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned about a âwhite-collar bloodbathâ that could wipe out 50 per cent of entry-level jobs. The companyâs Claude AI is gaining attention for its coding abilities, a feature that could displace more junior programmers.Â âWeâre entering a world where the (tasks of) junior-level software engineers â maybe many of the tasks of the more senior-level software engineers â are starting to be done most of the way by AI systems. Now thatâs going to go further,â Mr Amodei said in an interview at Davos on Jan 20. While he believes the good from the technology will outweigh the bad, high unemployment and underemployment are risks that need to be mitigated.Â âThereâs going to be unfortunately a whole class of people who are, across a lot of industries, going to have a hard time coping,â he said.Â On Jan 21, Mr Fink noticeably avoided probing Mr Huang on sensitive topics, most notably China. Nvidiaâs sales to the country are controversial, and the company is waiting to hear whether it will be able to sell its chips to the country and in what quantities. Just on Jan 20, Mr Amodei likened shipping Nvidia chips into China to selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.Â Mr Huang is expected to visit China at the end of January as he works to reopen a crucial market for the companyâs AI chips. It is a pivotal time for the business, after the United States moved to ease limits on chip exports to China which it has had in place since 2022. Nvidia is still blocked from shipping the top-of-the-line chips to the country, stymieing Beijingâs ability to innovate beyond the cutting-edge of AI, but will be able to ship older-generation H200 AI chips. China, meanwhile, is expected to clear H200 imports for commercial use in the first three months of 2026, though it will not allow the chips for use in the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure or its state-owned enterprises, Bloomberg News reported. Some of the countryâs most prominent tech firms, including Alibaba Group and ByteDance, have privately expressed interest in ordering more than 200,000 units each of the chip.Â BLOOMBERG Nvidia AI/artificial intelligence Employment E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Title: Don't call it a layoff: Ubisoft issues a full return-to-office order for all employees as it confirms more studio closures are coming

I can't help wondering if maybe there's a connection. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Stuffed away in a corner of Ubisoft's latest high-speed skid off a cliff is a note for employees: "To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams." Employees who have been working remotely in any capacity, in other words, will no longer have that option: It's back to conventional office time for everyone. "This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams," Ubisoft said, explaining the decision. "In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market." In lieu of regular remote work, employees will be given "an annual allowance of working-from-home days." It seems like a small thing amidst yet another Ubisoft catastrophe, but the reaction to the announcement is strongly negative, and rightly so. Remote work, by and large, works, and after years of doing so effectively and adjusting their lives accordingly, being ordered back to the office on a full-time basis is incredibly disruptive for employees suddenly find themselves faced with a need to find childcare, pay commuting costs, and absorb other related expenses, all with no compensating increase in pay—which is to say nothing of the massive and often unnecessary pain in the ass it is. Because of that, some employees, and possibly many, simply won't do it. Which is the point: It's an effect companies have wielded strategically as a form of "soft layoffs," in which employees aren't actually laid off, but are instead presented with onerous conditions for continued employment that effectively coerces them into resigning. The term can also be applied to, for example, a "voluntary career transition program" in which employees are given the choice to either quit now with some benefits, or risk getting shitcanned later with nothing. Ring a bell? It happened recently at Ubisoft Massive, which in October 2025 offered employees "the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms," and then dropped the hammer earlier this month when not enough of them did so. And yes, more such cuts are coming: Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said today that as part of the company's latest bid to keep the lights on, it will "selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Does a return-to-office mandate fit well with a need to close studios and cut jobs? You bet it does, and we've seen it happen in the past. In 2023, for instance, a World of Warcraft producer said "Blizzard is losing amazing talent" because of Activision-Blizzard's RTO policy, and in April 2025, amidst contract negotiations with Microsoft, ZeniMax Workers United-CWA Local 6215 member Zachary Armstrong said "underpayment and costly RTO [return to office] initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment." Ubisoft has done it too. In September 2024 the Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (SJTV) union called for a strike when Ubisoft told workers that they'd have to come into the office at least three days a week. The RTO mandate (and everything else) has sparked renewed ire from unions. Carmel Smyth, president of CWA Canada—the union representing the recently closed Ubisoft Halifax studio—said it is waiting for proof that the Halifax shutdown "was not to keep out the union," and added pointedly, "as much as the company cries poor, it did just buy a studio from Amazon in Montreal a month ago." Ubisoft is also facing an entirely predictable strike action over what the French game industry union Solidaires Informatique called a "disastrous" restructuring announcement. The union's demands include "maintaining and extending the teleworking conditions." UBISOFT - Call for strike Following the disastrous announcements made by Mr. Yves Guillemot (cost-cutting plan, projects scrapped, end of remote working, etc.), the Solidaires Informatique union is calling for a strike on Thursday, January 22, in the morning. Of course, I can't say that this is an intentional effort to shed hundreds of workers. But I can say that Ubisoft is eager—maybe even desperate—to do so, and as much as it tries to mask the maneuver in terms of collaboration and efficiency, it is what it is: Some employees will leave rather than return to the office, and that's what Ubisoft wants.

Pondering whether Ethereum could become the “toll road” to blockchain-based markets, the report stated that Ethereum “could be poised to benefit” from a shift spurring moves across legacy financial institutions, from DTCC to the New York Stock Exchange. Ethereum currently underpins 65% of tokenized assets, according to the report. Meanwhile, the adoption of stablecoins is outpacing spot crypto trading volumes, suggesting that “tokenized assets may have a use-case outside of purely speculative trading.” The second-largest digital asset by market cap has the potential to accrue value if a growing number of firms tap Ethereum for creating digital representations of real-world assets, according to Jay Jacobs, U.S. Head of Equity ETFs at BlackRock. He authored the report. “If we see more tokenized assets utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, ultimately, you would see it be a beneficiary of additional trading activity, [and the] issuance of things like stablecoins or real- world assets,” Jacobs told Decrypt. “If you’re an investor looking to play the growing adoption of blockchain technology, one of the best and probably fastest-growing use cases right now is tokenization, and Ethereum is a beneficiary of that trend,” he added. Although a pie chart included in the report references 10 networks capable of supporting tokenized assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only ones that are mentioned elsewhere, suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager has a distinct view toward them. The report didn’t include assets tokenized on Canton Network either. The permissioned blockchain, which was recently tapped by DTCC for its tokenization pilot, is currently used as a record-keeping layer for $362 billion in real-world assets, according to RWA.xyz. Ethereum, meanwhile, supports $13.2 billion in real-world assets that can be managed in-wallet. When it comes to BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, the $1.6 billion product primarily exists on Ethereum ($499 million) and Binance’s BNB Chain ($503 million). Broadly, Jacobs said there’s a lot of interest in what BlackRock is calling “the convergence,” where traditional markets are becoming increasingly interconnected with crypto. He pointed to spot exchange-traded funds for digital assets as an example. BlackRock is behind the largest ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have $70.6 billion and $10.7 billion in assets under management, respectively, according to CoinGlass. The firm has stood by as competitors have created products for other digital assets like XRP and Solana. “You have traditional securities and assets that are looking to be tokenized, and frankly, you have [digital] assets that [...] are making their way into the more traditional financial systems,” he said. “We believe in that convergence that does seem to be accelerating.” Still, Jacobs said that there are plenty of pieces that need to fall into place, whether that’s regulatory policy or company-level policy. Last year, the SEC created a task force to develop a “comprehensive and clear” regulatory framework for digital assets, but the expected passage of a market structure bill could also shape the regulator’s treatment of tokenized assets. What’s more, if firms want to take advantage of capabilities like around-the-clock trading or instant settlement through tokenization—qualities that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink first highlighted in 2022—then Jacobs said there would need to be the development of a supportive market around the technology across a variety of assets. “It’s early,” he said. “There's a lot of interest across financial firms to support this convergence right now, but not all innovation happens in a straight line—and ultimately, you need to see the benefits of tokenization materialized for the investors and trading community.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2026 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: ‘Only one person booed’: Al Gore heckles Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after Davos speech

By Ireland Owens, Daily Caller News Foundation January 21, 2026 Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was heckled by former Vice President Al Gore during a World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, according to news coverage. Gore booed Lutnick while the Commerce secretary was giving a speech at an invite-only dinner event hosted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Mediaite reported on Wednesday. The report comes after Lutnick criticized Europe during his remarks, which prompted European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to suddenly leave the dinner event, multiple outlets reported. “I sat and listened to his remarks,” Gore said Wednesday in a statement provided to Mediaite. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! “And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others,” Gore continued. The WEF and a representative for Gore each did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. “During Secretary Lutnick’s three-minute speech, no one left hastily,” a Commerce Department spokesperson told the DCNF in a statement on Wednesday. “Only one person booed, and it was Al Gore.” Moreover, Fox Business Network Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino wrote in a Wednesday X post that he was told by a “reliable” anonymous source that “at the dinner Lagarde walked out BEFORE [Lutnick’s] speech and was tired like everyone is at Davos.” Lutnick claimed in an op-ed published by the Financial Times on Tuesday that the Trump administration was “not going to Davos to uphold the status quo,” but instead was going “to confront it head-on.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” Lutnick wrote. “Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary, borders were not, and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good. That approach failed the US, crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well. It destroyed industries, weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind.” Gore suggested Wednesday that U.S. government policy should promote “regenerative agriculture” during a panel discussion at the WEF. Gore added that the U.S. needs “policies that [are] in recognition of the fact that governments around the world typically do subsidize farming, but don’t subsidize them in ways that incentivize them to go in the wrong direction, but incentivize them to go in the right direction.” Gore, the failed 2000 Democratic presidential nominee, is the cofounder and chairman of Generation Investment Management, and also the founder and chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a nonprofit organization which aims to combat the “climate crisis,” according to a biography on his website.

Former Vice President Al Gore briefly accosted Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after the Trump official’s speech on the sidelines of this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, The Post has learned. During a Tuesday VIP dinner hosted by billionaire BlackRock boss Larry Fink, where several hundred people were invited, Lutnick delivered a speech that was fiercely critical of European allies. When he stepped offstage, Gore walked up to him and said, “Boo” — like he was trying to scare him, a source told The Post. Lutnick laughed and someone at the event remarked, “What an honor to have Al Gore boo,” according to an insider. The ex-veep confirmed he’d disliked the speech. “I sat and listened to his remarks,” the avid environmentalist told The Post in a statement. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane. And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others.” According to media reports, a number of other crowd members booed while attendees including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde left the dinner before dessert was served. Fink reportedly tried to calm the audience as guests made for the exits. But a Commerce Department spokesperson and a BlackRock exec said Lagarde actually left before the remarks. “No one left hastily. Only one person booed and it was Al Gore,” a Commerce rep told The Post. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email.

Lagarde reportedly made a dash for the door as Lutnick argued that Europe was losing global influence — adding to tensions as President Trump ramped up his threats to take over Greenland. Just a day before the speech, the commerce secretary wrote a bold opinion piece for the Financial Times, stating: “We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear: With President Trump, capitalism has a new sheriff in town.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” he wrote.

Institutional investors and crypto whales viewed the ETH price drop below $3,000 as a buying opportunity, but data still hints at a deeper sell-off to $2,700. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ether (ETH) price saw a daily candle close below $3,000 on Tuesday, but a positive is that data showed large holders were buying throughout the dip. While ETH whale accumulation signals growing confidence, conflicting indicators suggest rising market risk for the altcoin. Key takeaways: ETH whales and institutional investors bought over $130 million in Ether as the price closed below $3,000 on Tuesday. BitMine added more than 92,500 ETH in January, showcasing the growing demand for staking yield. ETH dropped 7.83% to $2,938 on Tuesday, marking its largest daily correction since November 4, 2025. Despite the drop, onchain tracker Lookonchain reported ETH accumulation from whales and institutional investors. According to the data, Trend Research borrowed 70 million USDt (USDT) from Aave to buy 24,555 ETH worth $75.5 million, bringing its total holdings to 651,310 ETH valued at $1.92 billion. Separately, an OTC whale address acquired 20,000 ETH, worth $58.8 million, via FalconX and Wintermute. Institutional investor accumulation of ETH extended beyond trading desks. BitMine has added 92,511 ETH in January, valued at $268 million. The ETH treasury company said it expects to become the largest Ethereum staking entity once its planned 4.2 million ETH is fully staked, generating an estimated $367 million to $393 million annually in staking rewards. The company added that it projects another $35 million to $40 million in income from cash operations. However, not all large capital flows were supportive. On Wednesday, BlackRock transferred 30,828 ETH worth about $91 million to Coinbase Prime, fueling concerns over potential sell-side volatility. Related: ETH derivatives metric turns positive after years of sell-side dominance From a technical standpoint, ETH’s longer-term chart suffered a bearish shift after closing below $3,000. The move also pushed the price below the four-month point of control near $3,100, the level where the highest volume traded over that period, signaling that the market has lost its most accepted price range. The breakdown coincided with a bearish break of structure (BOS), suggesting trend continuation to the downside. Based on current liquidity clusters, ETH could eventually test external liquidity zones around $2,718 and $2,620. Over the past 24 hours, $287 million in leveraged positions were liquidated, with longs accounting for $257 million, highlighting forced selling pressure. Data from Hyblock adds to the cautious mood. The whale versus retail delta has flipped negative, falling to -6,480 for ETH, indicating that whales are reducing their long exposure or adding shorts more aggressively than retail traders. Such shifts have preceded periods of heightened short-term volatility. On the other hand, 76% of retail traders are in long positions, pointing to the potential for a price reversal near the key swing lows.

Investing Nebius Group (NBIS) secured a $19B Microsoft deal and a $3B Meta Platforms partnership over five years. Nebius projects 1,600% revenue growth by end of 2026 driven by surging AI compute infrastructure demand. Rising GPU spot prices directly boost Nebius rental revenue and margins with capacity sold out through 2026. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Anggalih Prasetya / Shutterstock.com Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) is forecasting up to 1,600% revenue growth by the end of 2026, driven by surging demand for AI compute infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run rate in revenue of $900 million to $1.1 billion for the end of 2025 and $7 billion to $9 billion by the end of 2026, as it scales to meet hyperscaler needs. Nebius has secured major contracts, including a multi-year deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) valued at over $19 billion and a $3 billion partnership with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) over five years. It is also expanding capacity from 220 megawatts (MW) to 800 MW and up to 1 gigawatt (GW) of connected power by the end of 2026, with contracted power reaching 2.5 GW. Despite this, some investors remain hesitant about buying the stock, but Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang just provided another reason why you Nebius Group should be at the top of your buy list. Supply of the latest generation of artificial intelligence (AI) chips remains sold out into 2026, making it difficult for companies to acquire new inventory promptly. Nvidia’s H200 chips, for instance, have seen Chinese firms place orders for over 2 million units for 2026, exceeding the company’s current stock of 700,000. This shortage stems from explosive demand for AI training and inference, which is outpacing production increases at foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). As a result, providers are negotiating additional output, with work set to begin in the second quarter of 2026. High-bandwidth memory, essential for these chips, is also constrained, with data centers projected to consume 70% of global production in 2026. This scarcity has forced companies to rent older-generation chips to bridge the gap. Two-generation-old GPUs, such as those from Nvidia’s Hopper series, are seeing increased utilization as users await further Blackwell and Rubin deployments. Providers like Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS have raised GPU instance prices by 15% in early 2026, reflecting the tight market. Benchmarks show spot rates for H100 equivalents stabilizing at $2.27 per hour in mid-January, up from December lows. Regional variations have pushed rates in Europe to $2.80 to $3.20 per hour. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Huang addressed AI bubble concerns by highlighting rising spot prices for GPU rentals. He stated: “If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it’s so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs.” Huang attributed this to real demand from new AI startups and companies reallocating R&D budgets, describing it as evidence of the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history.” This trend counters the 60% to 75% price declines seen in 2025, indicating at least a short-term rebound as delays and energy constraints limit the availability of Blackwell chips. Rising spot prices directly benefit Nebius by enabling higher per-hour charges on its GPU rentals, boosting revenue and margins. With 20% power efficiency advantages over peers and sold-out capacity, Nebius can adjust pricing dynamically during shortages. Its $19.4 billion Microsoft deal and $3 billion Meta contract provide stable baselines, supplemented by spot-market upside. Analysts project a 15% to 25% short-term revenue uplift, pushing growth over the next 12 months to 339% and potentially $4 billion-plus in annualized run rate if prices hold. Nebius’s early adoption of Nvidia’s Vera Rubin platform in the second half of 2026 further positions it to capture premium demand. Nebius isn’t the only beneficiary of this trend. IREN (NASDAQ:IREN) and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR) also gain from rising GPU spot prices through their pivots to AI infrastructure. IREN’s own $9.7 billion Microsoft deal and 60,000 GPU target for 2026 enable 20% to 30% revenue increases due to dynamic pricing, with 117% growth projected for the next year. CIFR’s deals with Alphabet and Amazon — totaling over $8.5 billion — support 10% to 20% increases from premium leases, with growth projected at 149%. But if you still needed a reason to commit to buying Nebius stock, Jensen Huang just gave you one. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Trump says Mark Zuckerberg showed him a ‘Manhattan-sized’ AI data center

Full Content:
President Donald Trump gave a surprise shout-out to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg after his address at the World Economic Forum meeting Wednesday. At a Q&A after the address, Trump recounted a moment when Zuckerberg displayed a map of a proposed AI data center facility overlaid against Manhattan. The project’s footprint, Trump noted, appeared to swallow the entire island. “Mark Zuckerberg showed me a plant where he put it over a map of Manhattan, and it was basically the size of Manhattan,” Trump told the crowd of global elites. “I said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding.’ It was miles long, miles wide, and very high. It literally covered most of the island.”Meta’s stock jumped 1.6% after Trump’s statement, paring gains to 0.9% as of press time. While Trump referred to the project as a “big plant,” he could have been referring to Meta’s Richland Parish “Hyperion” AI data center campus, which is currently underway in Louisiana and is set to open in 2030. The massive industrial undertaking comprises 2,250 acres—a landmass equal to roughly 1,700 football fields; the campus will house 4 million square feet of data center space, making it one of the largest silicon clusters on earth. However, that 4 million square feet is much smaller than Manhattan’s 22 square miles; raising questions about whether Trump was referring to a much larger project being built by Zuckerberg. Trump also marveled at the project’s $50 billion price tag, contrasting the staggering investment with traditional real estate, harkening back to his past life as a developer. That $50 billion matches the projected cost of building the Hyperion data center campus.“If you spend $500 million, you can build a good shopping center,” Trump remarked. “But how do you spend $50 billion? When I looked at this thing, I understood why.” Meta is currently transitioning from a social media company to an AI infrastructure giant, raising its capital expenditure guidance for the 2025 fiscal year to nearly $72 billion, 70% more than the previous year. Looking into 2026, Zuckerberg has warned of “notably larger” spending, with market analysts projecting that annual outlays could surpass $100 billion. The president said that AI is “massive” and driving a rapid demand for energy that requires a shift in policy. Recognizing that the aging U.S. electrical grid cannot support the two-to-five gigawatts of power that these “titan clusters” require, Trump ordered the government to step aside during his speech: He told the Davos audience that he has authorized AI companies to act as their own private utilities. So far it seems that under this new framework, tech giants will build their own on-site power plants using natural gas, coal, or oil. Trump promised to slash the bureaucratic red tape that usually bogs down such projects, making them drag on for four or five years. Instead, he pledged to deliver federal approvals for these private energy plants in just two weeks, as long as the companies build their “own electric generating plants.” “You people are brilliant. You have a lot of money,” Trump said, addressing the tech executives in the room, egging them on to start building their own plants. This industrial blitz serves as the president’s primary leverage ahead of his planned state visit to China in April. Trump has argued that American leadership in AI depends on physical infrastructure rather than just software, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping respects this rapid industrial execution. “I’ve always had a very good relationship with President Xi,” Trump said. “But we’re leading the world in AI by a lot because I’ve allowed these big companies to build their own electric capacity. We’re creating more energy than any country anywhere in the world.” China and the U.S. are widely seen to be neck and neck in the AI race, with each country emphasizing their own strengths to best the other. The U.S. leads China in AI talent, investment, and access to semiconductors, while China has the U.S. beat on AI-related infrastructure, according to a recent Morgan Stanley report. China is just “months” behind the U.S. in terms of model quality, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, told CNBC. The same day Trump was speaking at Davos, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed fears of an AI bubble while discussing China’s progress. The release of DeepSeek in 2023, in particular, he highlighted as a “major breakthrough.” Huang called China’s advance in this regard “a huge event for most of the industries, most of the companies around the world, because it’s the world’s first open reasoning model.” Since then, he explained, many open reasoning models have emerged, enabling researchers to create something that’s domain specific or specialized for their needs. In the U.S., Mark Zuckerberg has stood out for his own commitment to open-source AI, citing DeepSeek as a model.

Title: Ubisoft Shake-Up: Layoffs, Studio Closures Begin in Major Reorg; Six Games Canceled, Including ‘Prince of Persia’ Remake

By Jennifer Maas TV Business Writer After weeks of speculation following reported studio closures and rounds of layoffs, French video game publisher Ubisoft announced Wednesday it is launching a reorganization of the company that will see operations divided into five “Creative Houses,” each focused on a specific creative genre. As a result, six games in the works at Ubisoft, including the upcoming “Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time” remake, have been scrapped. Related Stories More Than 1 Million YouTube Channels Are Using AI Tools Daily — and CEO Says Platform Is Actively Working to Curb 'AI Slop' BBC Confirms Landmark YouTube Deal, Including New Channels and Winter Olympics Coverage The five decentralized houses part of the new model “will combine game development and go-to-market functions with a gamer-centric approach, and be fully responsible for brand development, content strategy as well as editorial direction;” “will be shaped by distinct creative ‘genres’ led by dedicated high-profile, incentivized teams with a unique set of expertise in those genres;” and “have full financial ownership and account for economic performance.” Popular on Variety During a media call Wednesday, Ubisoft leadership would not confirm how many more layoffs (the Halifax and Stockholm studios have now been shuttered) will be coming as the 17,000-employee company is restructured, but noted details on work force reduction will be shared at a later date. Per Ubisoft, the five new creative houses include the following, the first being Ubisoft’s new subsidiary, Vantage Studios, which began operations last year: Along with the “Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time” remake, Ubisoft has discontinued four unannounced games and one mobile title that “do not meet the new enhanced quality aswell as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria at Group level.” Ubisoft says it will allocate additional development time to seven unnamed games in order to “ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation,” including an unannounced title initially planned to release in fiscal year 2026 that has now been delayed to fiscal year 2027. According to Ubisoft, four new IPs are currently in development, including the game “March of Giants,” which it recently required from Amazon, and the creative houses where those games will be allocated will be announced at a later date. As part of the restructuring, Ubisoft will return to a five-days-per-week in office policy for all teams, which will include an annual allowance of working-from-home days. Amid the news Wednesday, Ubisoft shared early results for its latest quarter, reporting €330 million in sales, which it says are “primarily driven by an overperformance linked to partnerships and reflecting a robust back-catalog.” The full earnings will be reported Feb. 12 as previously announced. “On the one hand, the AAA industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,” Yves Guillemot, Founder and CEO of Ubisoft, said in a statement Wednesday. “On the other hand, exceptional AAA games, when successful, have more financial potential than ever. In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time. We are transforming Ubisoft’s operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences. At the center of this transformation are our Creative Houses, integrated business units now combining production and publishing and therefore unifying the gamer relationship. Each one is built around a clear genre and brand focus, with full responsibility and financial ownership, led by dedicated leadership teams. It is a radical move, relying on a more decentralized creative organization with faster decision making and best in-class cross functional core services supporting and serving each Creative House.” Guillemot’s statement continues: “To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reductions initiatives to rightsize the organization. We will discontinue several projects currently in development and provide additional time to certain games, to ensure enhanced quality and maximize long term value. We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group. While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term. Taken together, these measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term. The portfolio refocus will have a significant impact on the Group’s short term financial trajectory, particularly in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, but this reset will strengthen the Group and enable it to renew with sustainable growth and robust cash generation. Ubisoft is entering a new phase – one designed to reclaim creative leadership and build value for players and stakeholders over the long term.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

The American empire of Trump’s investment pledges: Heavily weighted on AI data centers and pharma. Neither of which produce economic growth on behalf of consumers. Data centers add cost to every business, including utilities and water which are heavily weighted. Water; one data center can use upwards of a million gallons daily. Electricity; one data center can use the same amount of electricity as an entire town. Pharma does not add to growth – they add to injury and death. To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Русский, Español, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. These are not economic boosters – they are nightmares. Data centers are like banks – nonproducing economic drains. Defense spending needs to be cut by 70%. It does NOT add to the economy – it is a toilet emptying into a sewer. We need unimpeded trade. Manufacturing is a dying art in America. Revitalizing it without ‘workers’ is a dead fish stinking up the sewer. Trump is focusing on elites which in the long term is simply another toilet. Elites don’t produce, they don’t work. The $18 trillion in investments has been redefined as $9.7 trillion weighted between Middle East pledges with the exclusion of Israel which produces IDF mercenaries. Somehow, Japan’s initial ten-year pledge of $490 billion has ratcheted up to $1 trillion per the White House. Does Japan know? Because Japan’s government/economy is heavily indebted – ranking number one in the world at over 250% of GDP. Meta has pledged $600 billion on net equity of $182 billion. Its pledge is based on AI and ‘workforce expansion’ which has so far resulted in 4,600 layoffs and an announcement that 10% more are forthcoming. Apple has also announced major restructuring. Its balance sheet reveals current assets short roughly $20 billion compared to current assets. Net equity of $73 billion. Pledges are only as good as the air we breathe – remastered by chemtrails and toxins. The fact that Trump desperately needs adulation is indicative of a man whose façade is deception. Having been married to a psychologically diagnosed narcissist – I have become intimately aware of the traits. Pathological lying is ALWAYS one of the prominent symptoms. Middle East pledges are typically defense- and pharma-related. Like defense, pharma does not add to economic growth because it creates disease and disease means death. The White House is either grossly deluded or grossly deluding when it purports to state that these ‘investments’ have ANY positive effect on the standard of living for Americans. The biggest drivers of a good economy for consumers are built on wage growth, stable prices, low interest rates, and rising asset values – particularly housing. Wage growth has been artificially linked to false inflation numbers. Prices have risen 50% when inflation is clocked at 2%. Trump called for a 10% interest cap on credit cards to which not ONE has agreed to the ‘suggestion’. Why? Because it is not a law. It is merely a superficial request. Like a pledge. Like a pinky swear. Like – when my ship rolls in. Trump is simply Biden with a different AI projection. An illusion. Delusions of grandeur have consumed politicians and bankers and we need to extricate these human imposters before The Georgia Guidestones become our reality. Of course, the $1.598 question is – How? History answers the question. But it also reveals that the sewage has never been fully cleansed of its putrid toxins and instead humanity bought time. Before the cycle was reborn. Each time, more evil than the last. As though Hell itself was opened upon earth. This concept is being played out between Russia and Ukraine as Putin slowly comes to the realization that a peace deal on a piece of paper is meaningless. The only answer to the elimination of evil is its complete eradication. While various journalists including Seymour Hersh radically denounce Russia for not being more formidable in their destruction of humanity, Putin’s deterrence was rooted in humanity – and unless you have been assigned this military command you can’t possibly understand. Zelenskyy, Trump, Netanyahu are aligned in a psychological Babylonian construct. Killing innocent persons – for the greater good – would be Hersh’s means of ending conflict; a decision that for a true Christian is untenable in the sight of God. Hindsight is always the greatest insight. As I have stated before – when you do as they do, you become the enemy you fight. A difficult decision for a man. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

January 21, 2026 09:09 ET | Source: Equity Insider Equity Insider VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Insider - News Commentary – The North American nuclear landscape has shifted from planning to rapid execution, sparked by a $2.7 billion U.S. Department of Energy commitment to onshore uranium enrichment[1]. This massive structural realignment was further bolstered by an $800 million federal award to accelerate the deployment of small modular reactors[2], moving the industry beyond policy talk and into direct capital deployment. As the market re-rates the entire fuel cycle, several key platforms are emerging as leaders in domestic energy security, including Eagle Energy Metals (OTC: SVIIF) (Soon-to-be under symbol ‘NUCLR’), Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU), NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR), Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR), and Canada Nickel Company (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF). Global investment in nuclear capacity is projected to triple by 2035, reaching approximately $210 billion as nations race toward ambitious 2050 power targets[3]. This secular transition is fueled by a new federal mandate that treats domestic critical minerals—from uranium to nickel—as vital national infrastructure[4]. In this unified industrial push, companies with execution-ready projects are being positioned to command the essential backbone of Western energy sovereignty. Eagle Energy Metals (OTC: SVIIF) (Soon-to-be under symbol ‘NUCLR’) announced this week that it has engaged BBA USA Inc., a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because the company is soon heading toward a NASDAQ listing under the ticker symbol NUCL through a business combination with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022. Eagle Energy holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data. "We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.," said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. "Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten." The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. In 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan. President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and quadrupling U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply. Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy, while Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear. Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds proprietary Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized. Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU) was awarded $900 million by the U.S. Department of Energy to expand its uranium enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio, to include commercial-scale production of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium. The competitively-awarded federal funding will support Centrus' previously announced multi-billion dollar expansion that will also include additional Low-Enriched Uranium production to serve commercial utilities and the existing reactor fleet, with the project expected to support 1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operating jobs in Ohio while retaining 150 existing positions. "This award represents a historic commitment to revitalizing America's nuclear fuel supply chain and reclaiming American nuclear leadership on the global stage," said Amir Vexler, President and CEO of Centrus Energy. "I am grateful to the Trump Administration for making this commitment and to Republicans and Democrats in Congress who came together to provide this urgently needed funding." The fixed-price base task order amount is $900 million to bring new enrichment capacity online, with additional options for up to $170 million to produce and deliver HALEU to the Department. Centrus has already launched domestic centrifuge manufacturing at its Oak Ridge, Tennessee factory, with first new capacity expected online in 2029. NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) has released study results demonstrating that pairing its advanced small modular reactor nuclear technology with a heat augmentation system can provide both profitable and reliable power for commercial chemical plants. The techno-economic assessment conducted in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory examined the performance of coupling a NuScale Power Module with a U.S. chemical facility to provide nuclear-generated steam and electric power. "As the first and only SMR to have our designs certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), NuScale continues to lead in the development of new technologies to provide process heat and electricity," said Dr. José Reyes, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at NuScale Power. "As we saw in the results of this assessment, delivering high-temperature steam with NuScale's scalable architecture provides industrial users with unparalleled flexibility that can be integrated into their processes and offers a promising new path for them to explore. We are proud of the collaboration with our partners at ORNL and grateful for the support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative for this study." The study demonstrated that the NuScale integrated energy system could meet chemical plant requirements of 1.3 million kg/h of process steam at 400°C and 4.1 MPa while also providing 73 MW of electric power. The hybrid system's scalable architecture offers maximum flexibility for optimizing plant energy use and profitability across various configurations. Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) exceeded FY-2025 guidance for finished uranium production, mined uranium ore production and uranium concentrate sales. The company's Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona and La Sal Complex in Utah produced over 1.6 million pounds of uranium in 2025, exceeding the top end of guidance by approximately 11%, while the White Mesa Mill produced more than one million pounds of finished U₃O₈ during 2025 with over 350,000 pounds produced in December alone. "These 2025 uranium metrics reinforce our reputation as, not only the country's lowest-cost and largest uranium producer, but as a company that delivers on its promises," said Mark S. Chalmers, CEO of Energy Fuels Inc. "Nuclear energy powered by uranium is among the cleanest, least expensive, and most reliable ways to supply our nation's growing energy and electricity needs." The company expects to sell 360,000 pounds of U₃O₈ in Q4-2025 at a weighted average sales price of approximately $74.93 per pound, representing 50% growth over Q3-2025 sales volumes. Energy Fuels Inc. completed two new long-term uranium sales contracts with U.S. nuclear power generating companies adding deliveries for 2027 to 2032 utilizing hybrid pricing with exposure to uranium market upside. Canada Nickel Company (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF) was named as the second project to be advanced under Ontario's new One Project, One Process framework, reflecting the advanced state, scale, and strategic importance of the Crawford Nickel Project within Ontario's Critical Minerals Strategy. The 1P1P framework is designed to better coordinate Ontario's permitting and review processes for major mining developments by aligning timelines, responsibilities, and information sharing across provincial ministries. "Ontario is moving at lightning speed to open this 100% Canadian owned mine to create 4,000 jobs for Canadian workers," said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. "In 2026, our government is going full-tilt to unlock one of the world's largest nickel deposits that will supercharge our economy and help end China's critical mineral dominance." Crawford is expected to be the largest nickel sulphide project in the western world and among the most economically significant mining developments in Canada, with independent analysis estimating the Project will generate more than $70 billion in GDP over its initial 40+ year mine life. Canada Nickel Company is targeting construction commencement by year-end 2026.

Investing NVDL has attracted $4.7B in assets by offering 2x daily leverage on Nvidia (NVDA). Daily compounding erodes returns during volatility. Nvidia posted 62.5% year-over-year revenue growth. Growth below 40% quarterly would trigger a repricing lower. Nvidia’s data center sales represent over 80% of total revenue. Next earnings report lands February 25. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / JRdes NVDL offers a straightforward but unforgiving proposition: double Nvidia’s daily return, every day. Since launching in December 2022, it has attracted $4.7 billion in assets by amplifying the defining AI infrastructure stock. Shares sit around $79, down nearly 10% year to date after NVDA slipped 4.5% through mid-January. That divergence matters. NVDL didn’t deliver exactly double NVDA’s decline because daily leverage compounds, a mechanical reality that erodes returns when the underlying stock swings sideways or trends down. For anyone holding or considering NVDL, the most important factor to watch is Nvidia’s ability to sustain revenue growth above 50% annually. That threshold matters because NVDA’s valuation premium, a forward price-to-earnings ratio around 24, depends on maintaining hypergrowth in data center demand. The company posted 62.5% revenue growth year over year in its most recent quarter ending October 2025, reaching $57 billion in sales. That pace is decelerating from the triple-digit growth rates seen throughout fiscal 2025. If quarterly revenue growth drops below 40%, expect the stock to reprice lower, and NVDL to magnify that move violently. Track Nvidia’s quarterly earnings releases, which occur roughly every three months. The next report lands February 25, 2026, after market close. Pay attention to three figures: data center revenue growth, gross margin trajectory, and management’s guidance for the following quarter. Data center sales represent over 80% of total revenue, and any sign of slowing hyperscaler spending from Microsoft, Amazon, or Google will hit the stock hard. Gross margin, currently above 75%, reflects Nvidia’s pricing power. If that figure compresses due to competitive pressure from custom AI chips, it signals eroding dominance. NVDL resets its leverage every day, which means it doesn’t deliver double NVDA’s return over longer periods. In volatile or sideways markets, daily compounding works against you. NVDA’s RSI currently sits at 40.4, down from 51.8 just four days earlier, signaling weakening momentum without reaching oversold territory below 30. If NVDA continues chopping sideways while investors wait for the next earnings catalyst, NVDL will underperform a simple 2x calculation due to volatility decay. This isn’t a flaw, it’s how daily leveraged products work. Direxion’s SOXL offers 3x daily leverage on the broader semiconductor sector through the ICE Semiconductor Index, which includes NVDA but also TSMC, Broadcom, and AMD. While more aggressive, it spreads single-stock risk across the chip industry. If you’re concerned about Nvidia-specific execution risk, like supply constraints or competitive threats from custom silicon, SOXL provides sector exposure without total dependence on one company’s quarterly performance. Watch Nvidia’s data center revenue growth and NVDL’s daily compounding behavior. Those two factors will determine whether this ETF continues amplifying gains or eroding capital through volatility. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later. Leveraged ETFs demand a different monitoring framework than buy-and-hold funds, and SOXL’s 3x daily exposure to semiconductors makes the distinction… NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is getting hit on 2 fronts today as the stock drops 5% as of 1:45 p.m. EST, curtailing… 24/7 Wall Street Insights Nvidia is scheduled to enact a 10-for-1 forward stock split on June 7, 2024.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been one year since President Donald Trump was sworn back into office — and four of the wealthiest tech billionaires who attended or donated to his inauguration have gotten richer. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Jensen Huang — all of whom are featured on Bloomberg's list of 500 wealthiest people in the world — were among the tech royalty who signaled support for the administration, either through attendance or a donation. Others included Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and Shou Zi Chew. The tech billionaire with the largest increase in his net worth during Trump's first year is also the one who was closest to the Trump administration: Elon Musk. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the Tesla CEO's wealth increased by 52% over the past year. While Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Huang are all wealthier today than they were on Inauguration Day in 2025, there have been some ups and downs. Collectively, the group lost $194 billion in wealth during Trump's first 100 days as markets reacted to the administration's tariffs. They've since made up for those losses and then some. As of January 19, the group was cumulatively $288 billion wealthier than a year prior. Here's where all four stood as of Monday, January 19, 2026. Net worth January 19, 2025: $449 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $681 billion Percent change: +52% After spending at least $277 million backing Trump and Republicans during the 2024 election, Musk attended the inauguration and worked closely with the White House as the public face of the White House DOGE Office. Following his departure in May, Musk and Trump had a very public falling out, though they later reconciled. Musk's work with DOGE resulted in backlash against Tesla, with the company's share price declining in the first few months of Trump's presidency. It has since recovered, and in the year since Trump was elected Musk has solidified his standing as the world's richest man. In November, Tesla shareholders approved a $1 trillion-dollar pay package for the Tesla CEO, if he hits a series of goals, and there are plans for a SpaceX IPO in 2026. Net worth January 19, 2025: $245 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $261 billion Percent change: +7% Bezos's wealth, most of which is tied to Amazon stock, has increased since Trump took office a second time. Bezos, the Amazon founder and chairman, attended the inauguration alongside his now-wife Lauren Sánchez. Amazon also donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee. Analysts have said that Amazon was especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, and CEO Andy Jassy said this week prices on the platform are increasing as a result of tariffs. Amazon's share price is roughly the same as it was a year ago. Net worth January 19, 2025: $217 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $220 billion Percent change: +1% Zuckerberg and Trump once had a contentious relationship that went back several years prior to the 2024 election, with the latter at one time threatening to have the Meta CEO jailed over Facebook banning Trump's account in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot. Zuckerberg publicly warmed to Trump during the 2024 cycle, offering him praise and attending the inauguration. Zuckerberg was seated next to Trump at a White House dinner attended by tech leaders last year. Meta also donated $1 million to the inaugural committee. Net worth January 19, 2025: $117 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $154 billion Percent change: +32% Huang did not attend the inauguration, but Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural committee. The Nvidia CEO also met with Trump shortly after he took office and the company has worked with the White House on AI policy. Jump to

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Δ Seven snapshots reveal how climate rollbacks altered the trajectory of U.S. energy, environmental protection, and economic security. In just one year, President Donald Trump has fundamentally changed the arc of federal climate and environmental policy. Upon returning to office 12 months ago, Trump immediately declared an “energy emergency” and promised to “unleash American energy.” He packed his cabinet with oil executives and climate skeptics who have since rolled back the climate initiatives and protections of presidents Obama and Biden while accelerating fossil fuel development. From dismantling regulations designed to cut emissions and tame pollution to repealing the country’s most ambitious climate action, Trump has reveled in reversing years of progress. He has withdrawn from both the Paris Agreement and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and undercut scientific research at every opportunity. This retrenchment came even as much of the world moved forward in 2025. Worldwide, renewables provided 40 percent of all electricity. Coal-fired power generation declined in India and China for the first time in two generations. Global clean energy investment was 50 percent higher than fossil fuel investment. Still, the United States has clearly ceded leadership in the climate fight. These seven charts reflect a year with implications that will be felt for a long time to come. Grist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How The first year of Trump 2.0 brought sweeping changes to Washington’s view of electric vehicles, and American automakers felt the squeeze. President Donald Trump and Congress took several steps to eliminate federal support for it, including eliminating the $7,500 consumer tax credit. The administration also slashed fuel-economy targets — from about 50 mpg by 2031 to roughly 35 — and eliminated penalties for automakers that miss efficiency standards. The combined effect: higher prices for many electric vehicles built in the United States, uncertainty around battery and manufacturing investments, and a weaker regulatory push that now favors hybrids and conventional vehicles. EV market share in the country, which briefly topped 10 percent in the third quarter as buyers rushed to claim the expiring credit, has since fallen to single digits. Meanwhile, the global EV industry continues to accelerate, making the U.S. retreat look like a concession to China — and, to a lesser extent, Europe. Chinese industrial policy continues driving down costs, with industry giants CATL and BYD now supplying more than half of the world’s batteries. BYD overtook Tesla as the world’s best-selling EV manufacturer, selling 2.26 million cars in 2025 compared to Tesla’s 1.64 million. In the United States, Ford announced a $19.5 billion write-down, killed the F-150 Lightning pickup, and planned a pivot toward hybrids, citing federal policy changes as the primary driver. There was one bright spot in the data, though: The price gap between used internal combustion and electric vehicles is rapidly narrowing, and as of August it reached a record low of just $897. A glut of used EVs are also expected to hit the market over the next few years, which could drive prices down even further. So: The first year of Trump’s second term hasn’t exactly decimated the American EV industry, but it has transformed what might have been a sustained industrial policy push into a landscape of slow growth, rapid market shifts, and further consolidation of China’s manufacturing and battery supply chains. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How – Clayton Aldern, senior data reporter One of the more counterintuitive aspects of climate change is that cutting greenhouse gas emissions often requires more energy, not less. That’s because of electrification: Technologies like induction stoves, heat pumps for homes and factories, and electric cars all draw the grid. At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence requires ever more power-hungry data centers, further straining the electrical system. Yet in the first year of its second term, the Trump administration did everything in its power to slow the rollout of renewables like wind and solar, and even stalled several offshore wind projects already under development — even as rising electricity demand made them increasingly necessary. But even against these political headwinds, green energy continued to surge. States like California and Texas kept expanding solar, wind, and storage capacity, showing that market economics outweigh federal roadblocks. Electricity demand in the United States grew 3.1 percent last year, according to energy think tank Ember. At the same time, solar generation rose by 27 percent, meeting nearly two-thirds of that extra demand. Utilities have also been building huge battery banks to store that juice for use when the sun isn’t shining: California added nearly 70 percent more storage capacity in 2024 than the year before. While it will take time to suss out the Trump administration’s impact on this energy transition, it’s clear that market forces remain a powerful driver for states that understand that a cleaner grid is a cheaper, more reliable grid. – Matt Simon, senior staff writer The Federal Emergency Management Agency often makes headlines during disasters, but in recent years it also has spent billions helping hundreds of communities prepare for future catastrophes. The agency has long doled out grants to alleviate floods in low-lying areas and weatherize against storms, and under the Biden administration it launched new programs to build resilience against climate-fueled threats like wildfires and extreme heat. These programs have provided money to elevate thousands of homes in low-lying areas, manage flammable vegetation, and upgrade sewers to handle runoff from freak storms. That effort came to a stop earlier this year after Trump vowed to shrink federal spending. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced all FEMA payments above $100,000 would require her approval, reportedly creating a billion-dollar backlog of transactions. Quarterly spending on the program fell from a peak of around $500 million under Biden to less than zero last year as FEMA clawed back money from some recipients. The agency also has halted all new approvals for resilience projects. FEMA has continued to endorse new projects that don’t have an explicit climate focus, like installing backup generators and drafting disaster response plans, but it has shut down the Biden-era Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which funded long-term investments to reduce climate-related risks. FEMA does not appear to have approved a single project under that program since Trump’s inauguration, despite a federal court ruling in December ordering it to continue the program. – Jake Bittle, staff writer The country’s bedrock environmental laws are only as strong as their enforcement. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice, working alongside their state counterparts, are responsible for protecting the public and holding polluters accountable. But over the past year, the Trump administration has dismantled those agencies with sweeping layoffs and budget cuts, undercutting their ability to fulfill their missions. More than 11,500 employees of the two agencies have been laid off or resigned, including dozens from enforcement divisions. That’s left fewer federal inspectors to track pollution and fewer attorneys to pursue violators. That pullback is already reshaping how often — and how forcefully — the government goes after polluters. Over the first nine months of both Trump’s first term and the Biden presidency, the Justice Department launched roughly 40 civil enforcement cases against polluters. During the same stretch last year, it initiated just 11. The slowdown extends to prosecutions as well. Under the previous two administrations, the number of consent decrees resulting from federal cases typically hovered around 50. Last year, that figure fell to just 24, weakening one of the federal government’s most effective tools for forcing cleanup and compliance. The retreat deepens a decades-long erosion in regulatory oversight. According to the Environmental Integrity Project, many state environmental agencies — which carry out much of the day-to-day enforcement of such laws — have seen their funding for that work slashed. Between 2010 and 2024, those budgets declined in more than half of all U.S. states, and by more than one-third in at least seven. With federal enforcement budgets also being reduced, oversight is shrinking at every level of government. – Naveena Sadasivam, senior staff writer Delivering on his campaign promise to “drill, baby, drill,” President Trump, during his inaugural address, signaled a sweeping overhaul of federal land management. Later that day, he declared a national energy emergency and promised to fast-track domestic energy production and infrastructure “from coast to coast.” The directive marked a profound shift in the management of public land and coastal waters, with the goal of rapidly expanding fossil fuel development. In the year since, the Trump administration has targeted roughly 88 million acres that were once set aside for recreation and conservation, opening them for oil and gas development and logging. At the same time, the Bureau of Land Management, responsible for managing public lands for multiple uses and long-term sustainability, has held 22 lease sales and approved 6,027 new oil and gas permits, the highest number since 2010, according to the Center for American Progress. Some of the nation’s most sensitive landscapes are now at risk of development. The administration has, for example, moved to end protections for Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, which covers 19 million acres. Other threatened areas include forestland in the Boundary Waters region of Minnesota, the high desert mesas and canyons surrounding New Mexico’s Chaco Culture National Historical Park, approximately 58 million acres of roadless wilderness throughout the national forest system, and roughly 87 million acres of unique habitat for threatened and endangered species. These moves put ecosystems, wildlife, cultural sites, and communities at risk, transforming land once preserved for the public good into resources to be exploited by industry. – Juanpablo Ramirez-Franco, Midwest regional climate reporter The Inflation Reduction Act set aside about $2 billion to underwrite clean energy and climate resilience projects for tribal nations. The Trump administration has slashed funding for such work, leaving communities scrambling for alternatives and undermining progress toward their energy sovereignty. The federal grants and incentives helped tribes build solar farms, develop microgrids, expand battery storage, and advance climate-adaptation projects on their lands. For many communities, these initiatives weren’t just about clean energy, but providing a service people elsewhere take for granted. Tribal households face 6.5 times more outages than the U.S. average and a 28 percent higher energy burden. Roughly 54,000 residents of tribal lands lack electricity entirely. Over the past year, the Trump administration has slashed or frozen programs, including a $20 million grant to an Alaska village fighting coastal erosion, and, among other actions, threatened the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program that had promised $3 billion to 350 recipients. Without that backing, projects have stalled or teetered on collapse, leaving communities scrambling for private funding, philanthropic support, or loans to keep them moving forward. These cuts do more than slow the clean energy transition. They threaten Indigenous sovereignty, economic opportunity, and resilience to climate change. Tribal nations are having to reconsider their plans, seek new financing, and defend projects that were years in the making. As Washington pulls back, they are pushing forward, but the stakes for their communities, their lands, and their self-determination could not be higher. — Miacel Spotted Elk, Indigenous Affairs fellow For the nation’s farmers, 2025 was defined by uncertainty and mounting expenses as President Trump’s trade war reshaped agricultural markets. A protectionist agenda that his administration said would protect workers and lower costs instead left growers — particularly those who raise commodities like soybeans — with fewer buyers, higher bills, and an uncertain labor market. In February, Trump announced 10 percent tariffs on all goods from China, along with 25 percent levies on most imports from Canada and Mexico. Further duties followed in April. China retaliated with a 34 percent tax on products from the United States; in May, it stopped buying U.S. soybeans altogether. The escalating trade war with one of the country’s biggest markets for agricultural exports hit soybean and other commodity farmers hard. It didn’t help that Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum led to higher prices for farm equipment. China resumed purchasing U.S. soybeans in October, shortly before Trump announced the two countries had reached a trade deal. But prior to that, the Asian superpower had turned to other soybean producers, including Brazil and Argentina. That move has grave environmental implications. Production of the legume is a major contributor to deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado, a biodiverse savannah in central Brazil. Last month, Trump announced $12 billion in bridge payments to help farmers recover from the financial losses they’ve incurred. However, U.S. agricultural trade groups say it doesn’t go far enough to compensate farmers and reassure them that their livelihoods won’t rocked by future trade scuffles. — Frida Garza, staff writer A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Title: Nvidia Vs. Dogecoin: A Historic Ratio Suggests A Possible Rotation, Says Trader
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/nvidia-vs-dogecoin-historic-ratio-rotation/
Time Published: 2026-01-21T01:00:31Z
Full Content:
Trader Cryptollica (@Cryptollica) is arguing that an old relative-value signal is “back” in crypto markets, pointing to the DOGE/NVIDIA ratio and an unusually depressed Dogecoin RSI reading as evidence that capital could rotate from AI-linked equities into high-beta meme coins. In a post on X, Cryptollica said the DOGE/NVIDIA chart has returned to a long-term support zone that previously preceded outsized Dogecoin outperformance versus Nvidia in prior cycles. “THE SIGNAL IS BACK. IT’S HAPPENING AGAIN (2017… 2021… NOW),” the trader wrote. “The last two times this specific signal flashed on the DOGE/NVIDIA chart, we saw the biggest wealth transfer in history. The crowd is chasing the AI top. The algorithm is loading the Meme bottom. (Altcoin bottom).” The core claim is less about Dogecoin in isolation and more about positioning on a ratio between what Cryptollica framed as two cultural extremes: “You are watching the wrong chart. This is the ratio of ‘The World’s Most Valuable Company’ (AI) vs. ‘The World’s Most Famous Meme’.” From that framing, the trader leans into a cycle-rhymes narrative, asserting that the ratio has repeatedly found channel support before a DOGE-led surge. “Structure is repeating history,” Cryptollica wrote, attaching specific historical comparisons. “2017: Ratio hit channel support – DOGE outperformed NVDA by 100x. 2021: Ratio hit channel support – DOGE outperformed NVDA by 50x. NOW: We are back at the exact same support line.” The posts also attach a broader liquidity-rotation story that has circulated in various forms across risk markets: when one trade stops working, capital seeks the next high-beta outlet: “When the AI Bubble exhales, that liquidity doesn’t vanish. It rotates into High-Beta Speculation,” the trader wrote. “The crowd is buying NVDA at the top. The algorithm is positioning for the DOGE reversal.” In another post, Cryptollica shifted from the ratio to Dogecoin’s weekly momentum indicator, sharing a second chart highlighting RSI levels and labeling prior cycle lows. “Here you are witnessing an opportunity that only comes around once every 12 years,” the trader wrote. “Over the past 12 years (2014–2026), Dogecoin’s RSI has dropped this low only 4 times. Every single one was an epic buying opportunity.” The post describes those four moments as a sequence of cycle bottoms, including an “all-time low” first cycle bottom, a “cycle bottom + COVID crash,” a “last cycle bottom,” and “RIGHT NOW!” Cryptollica concluded with a blunt decision frame: “Math or emotions — which one decides for you?” While neither post includes an explicit price target, the analyst said in early December that he expects Dogecoin to reach $1.30 over the medium term, citing a parallel channel top on the 3-day DOGE/USD chart. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.12581. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Apple set to sell millions of $2,000 foldable iPhones in 2026, Citi says

Update font size. Reset Apple could be on the verge of its most transformative iPhone release in years. According to a new note from Citi analyst Atif Malik, the tech giant is poised to launch its first foldable iPhone later in 2026 — likely debuting alongside the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max models at Apple’s annual fall event — with shipments ramping up quickly thereafter. Priced at a premium of around $2,000, the device is expected to see limited initial volume of approximately 8 million units in 2026 (roughly 3% of total iPhone shipments), before accelerating to 20 million units in 2027. Brian Sozzi for Yahoo Finance: ‎ The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on Apple — about 50% of Wall Street analysts rate Apple a Buy, Yahoo Finance data shows. He did cut his price target to $315 from $330, citing margin risk from the surge in memory chip prices. Shares of Apple have lagged the S&P 500 over the past year, gaining 11% compared to a 15% advance for the S&P 500. The stock isn’t faring any better to kick off 2026, either — shares are down 6%, tying with Meta (META) for the worst-performing member of the Magnificent Seven. But Apple may be poised to improve the narrative on the stock. For one, Apple just inked an important deal with Google, where Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology will power the next generation of the smartphone maker’s AI for Siri. While some experts say the deal is an admission that Apple is well behind in the AI race, others would counter at least Apple is now in the game. Secondarily, a long-rumored foldable iPhone would create a fresh reason for people to finally upgrade from prior iPhone iterations. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Apple won’t be able to make enough foldable iPhones to satisfy demand well into 2027. As BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a recent note to clients, “Upcoming catalysts include launch of a foldable iPhone in the fall and the launch of an enhanced Siri with integration with Gemini AI which can drive higher upgrades.” ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Title: Stewart Brand – Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One
URL: https://press.stripe.com/maintenance-part-one
Time Published: 2026-01-20T19:01:30Z
Full Content:
The first in a multi-volume work, Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One offers a comprehensive overview of the civilizational importance of maintenance. The book explores the insights that can be gleaned from the maintenance of sailboats, vehicles, and weapons, with absorbing detours into the evolution of precision in manufacturing, the enduring importance of manuals, sustainment in the military, and the never-ending battle against corrosion. Maintenance: Of Everything is a wide-ranging and provocative call to expand what we mean by “maintenance.” It invites us to understand not only the profound impact maintenance has on our daily lives but also why taking responsibility for maintaining something—whether a motorcycle, a monument, or our planet—can be a radical act. Stewart Brand is the cofounder and president of The Long Now Foundation. He created and edited the National Book Award-winning Whole Earth Catalog from 1968 to 1998. His books include The Media Lab (1987), How Buildings Learn (1994), The Clock of the Long Now (1999), and Whole Earth Discipline (2009). He was the subject of the documentary We Are As Gods (2020). Stewart Brand makes a persuasive case that keeping the human show on the road through well-planned maintenance is as vital and as fascinating a task as innovation and discovery themselves. A deliciously good book. Matt Ridley author of The Rational Optimist Once again, Stewart Brand reframes our worldview with a new perspective. You may not imagine you would be interested in rust, Soviet tanks, or tricked-out Model Ts—that is, until Brand reexamines them through the lens of maintenance. Maintenance: Of Everything is destined to be a classic. Danny Hillis cofounder of Applied Invention Stewart Brand is back with a manifesto on maintenance, the tool that empowers all tools. Preventative maintenance, deferred maintenance, and emergency maintenance: this much-needed, no-nonsense treatise illuminates the difference, and why it counts. George Dyson author of Darwin Among the Machines and Turing’s Cathedral Civilization is maintenance. No one else but Stewart Brand is talking about the art and science of maintenance and how to do it well. This will be an instant classic. Kevin Kelly founding executive editor of Wired Brand masterfully takes us on a journey through the world of the fixers keeping the gears of civilization rolling. If you’re the kind of person who wants to know why things break and how to stop it, you should read this book. Kyle Wiens CEO of iFixit What a splendid book to read while fixing an old house. I stopped moaning and whining and became a quiet hero of relentless “sustainment.” Bruce Sterling author and editor of Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology Maintenance is interesting in more ways than I can count. I felt smarter for having read this book and lucky for being alive at a time when Stewart Brand is writing it. Charles C. Mann author of 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus In his fresh and inimitable prose, Stewart Brand makes a striking case for what he calls maintenance–the upkeep of the things that make modern life possible. Back to the basics of caring and repairing–sailing boats, automobiles, sewing machines, Colt revolvers, bicycles and even tanks in the Yom Kippur war–Brand shows us why know-how and understanding how machines work really matter. New things get our attention but mastering how to take care of things we already have is life work that counts like no other. This book is Stewart Brand at his best. Jerry Brown former Governor of California A new classic — original and fresh, smart, wise, a universal topic, Stewart makes me so happy once again. Edward Tufte statistician and professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale University Efficiency is the engine of civilization. But where do improvements in production efficiency come from? In The Origins of Efficiency, Brian Potter argues that improving production efficiency—finding ways to produce goods and services in less time, with less labor, using fewer resources—is the force behind some of the most consequential changes in human history. He examines the fundamental characteristics of a production process and how each can be made faster, cheaper, and more reliable, with detailed examples from a range of industries: steel and semiconductors, wind turbines and container shipping, Tesla and the Ford Model T, and more. The Origins of Efficiency is a comprehensive companion for anyone seeking to understand how we arrived at this age of material abundance—and how we can push efficiency improvements into domains like housing, medicine, and education, where much work is left to be done. Brian Potter is the author of the Construction Physics newsletter and a senior infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress. He previously managed an engineering team at Katerra, a SoftBank-backed construction startup, and has 15 years of experience as a structural engineer. Brilliant and comprehensive. Brian Potter is the single best writer in America on how important things get built, and his new book is the single best example of his work. Derek Thompson author of Hit Makers and coauthor of Abundance A whole-systems overview of all known manufacturing processes (past and present), crammed with dense details, stories, anecdotes, and lessons from the front lines… If you have any interest in, or responsibility for, how to make stuff at scale, you need to read this book. Kevin Kelly founding executive editor of Wired Brian Potter does impeccable, detailed research that he turns into clairvoyant insight about civilization’s most arcane processes. Here, he examines the mechanisms that enable spectacular efficiency in the production of goods and services. Stewart Brand cofounder and president of The Long Now Foundation America has forgotten how to make things. Brian Potter is here to help us remember. By the time you finish this book, you’ll feel like you’re well on your way to becoming an expert in manufacturing. Noah Smith author of Noahpinion How did we build large language models? How do they think, if they think? What will the world look like if we have billions of AIs that are as smart as humans, or even smarter? In a series of in-depth interviews with leading AI researchers and company founders—including Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, DeepMind cofounder Demis Hassabis, OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever, MIRI cofounder Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—Dwarkesh Patel provides the first comprehensive and contemporary portrait of the technology that is transforming our world. Drawn from his interviews on the Dwarkesh Podcast, these curated excerpts range from the technical details of how LLMs work to the possibility of an AI takeover or explosive economic growth. It also includes 170+ definitions and visualizations, classic essays on the theme, and previously unpublished interviews. The Scaling Era offers readers unprecedented insight into a transformative moment in AI’s development—and a vision of what comes next. Dwarkesh Patel is the host of Dwarkesh Podcast, where he produces deeply researched interviews with both obscure intellectuals and the most influential figures of our time. Gavin Leech is the cofounder of Arb Research, a consultancy that does empirical and conceptual work in various sciences. He has a PhD in AI. Dwarkesh has done a whole series of excellent video interviews with top AI researchers and engineers, and this book is a great distillation of those conversations to help people understand modern AI models, how they are built, where they are headed, and why they are important. Jeff Dean chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research There’s only one test relevant for an artifact about AI: Would you learn more from reading it than you would from using a newly released LLM for the equivalent amount of time? The Scaling Era handily passes. Patrick McKenzie author of Bits About Money and host of Complex Systems Dwarkesh’s interviews are full of quotes that will be in history books. Byrne Hobart investor, consultant, and author of The Diff and Boom From the Moon landing to the dawning of the atomic age, the decades prior to the 1970s were characterized by the routine invention of transformative technologies at breakneck speed. By comparison, ours is an age of stagnation; of slowing median wage growth, rising inequality, and decelerated scientific discovery. In Boom, Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber take an inductive approach to this problem. They track some of the most significant breakthroughs of the past 100 years—from the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program to Moore’s law and Bitcoin—and reverse-engineer how transformative progress arises from the same dynamics that govern financial bubbles, bringing together small groups with a unified vision, vast funding, and surprisingly poor accountability. Bubbles, they conclude, aren’t all bad—in fact, they create the ideal conditions for transformative innovation. Integrating insights from economics, philosophy, and history, Boom provides a blueprint for accelerating innovation and a path to unleash a new era of global prosperity. Byrne Hobart is an investor, consultant, and writer. He is the author of The Diff, a daily newsletter covering inflection points in finance and technology. He is also a partner at Anomaly, a frontier tech investment firm. Tobias Huber is a writer and investor. He is a partner at Anomaly, a frontier tech investment firm. He has a background in philosophy and holds a doctor of science degree from ETH Zurich. The dot-com bubble looked like the peak of delusion, but the truly deluded were those who wanted to indefinitely defer the future. Everyone knows bubbles can disguise madness as wisdom; read this book for the alternative history of our age. Peter Thiel investor and author of Zero to One Boom makes the case that humanity’s greatest risk is not climate change or misaligned superintelligent Al but not making enough progress. A must-read for those who seek to build the future. Marc Andreessen cofounder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz When is it that temporary bubbles can help drive forward progress? This happened with the railroads, with the internet, and it is likely to happen with AI. Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber have produced some essential reading on a very important and also understudied topic. Tyler Cowen author of The Great Stagnation and professor of economics at George Mason University “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up,” Charlie Munger advises in Poor Charlie’s Almanack. Originally published in 2005, this compilation of 11 talks by the legendary Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman has become a touchstone for a generation of investors and entrepreneurs. Delivered with Munger’s characteristic rhetorical flair, Poor Charlie’s Almanack draws on his encyclopedic knowledge of business, finance, history, philosophy, physics, and ethics to introduce the latticework of mental models that underpin his rational and rigorous approach to life, learning, and decision-making. It is an essential volume for any reader seeking to go to bed a little wiser than when they woke up. This abridged edition features a new foreword by Stripe cofounder and president John Collison. Charles T. Munger (1924–2023) was an investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He was the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett. He was chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation from 1984 to 2011. He was also chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation and a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation.Peter D. Kaufman is the chairman and CEO of Glenair, Inc. He was a longtime director of Wesco Financial Corporation and is a former director of Daily Journal Corporation. In 2005, he edited and published Poor Charlie’s Almanack, a compilation of talks given by his longtime friend Charlie Munger. This book is something of a publishing miracle—never advertised, yet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its internet site. Warren Buffett CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Charlie Munger was born before corporate speak, before business leaders minced words to obscure truths. But Charlie Munger’s words have always cut like a knife—and that sharp spirit of truth-seeking built Berkshire into what it is today. We should all aspire to such clarity. Katherine Boyle general partner at a16z Poor Charlie’s Almanack is a timeless classic that will change how you approach life. There is a billion-dollar education inside this book. Shane Parrish founder of Syrus Partners and Farnam Street This book is the best way to learn from Munger and his ideas. It’s a must-read for anyone interested in thinking clearly, rationally, and effectively. Ana Lorena Fabrega author, educator, and chief evangelist at Synthesis Charlie Munger’s insights are timeless. Some of these speeches were delivered over 20 years ago, but they feel like they could have been given yesterday. Tyler Hogge venture partner at Pelion If I could only read one book to help me succeed in life and business, this is the book I’d read. Charlie’s timeless wisdom has inspired millions and will continue to resonate for generations to come.

Jason Citron founder and CEO of Discord In Pieces of the Action, Vannevar Bush—engineer, inventor, educator, and public face of government-funded science—offers an inside account of one of the most innovative research and development ecosystems of the 20th century. As the architect and administrator of an R&D pipeline that efficiently coordinated the work of civilian scientists and the military during World War II, he was central to catalyzing the development of radar and the proximity fuze, the mass production of penicillin, and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. Pieces of the Action offers his hard-won lessons on how to operate and manage effectively within complex organizations, build bridges between people and disciplines, and drive ambitious, unprecedented programs to fruition. Originally published in 1970, this updated edition includes a foreword from Ben Reinhardt that contextualizes the lessons Pieces of the Action can offer to contemporary readers: that change depends both on heroic individuals and effective organizations; that a leader’s job is one of coordination; and that the path from idea to innovation is a long and winding one, inextricably bound to those involved—those enduring figures who have a piece of the action. Vannevar Bush (1890–1974) was an engineer, inventor, educator, and architect of public-sector funding for scientific research in the United States. During World War II, he oversaw a wide-ranging R&D program that paired government funding with scientific research, resulting in the development of radar and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. Outside of government, he conducted foundational research in computer science, including the invention of the differential analyzer. His 1945 essay “As We May Think” is credited with anticipating aspects of personal computing and the internet, while his government report Science, The Endless Frontier laid the groundwork for the founding of the National Science Foundation. Both are considered seminal texts that have inspired successive generations of scientists and engineers. Pieces of the Action is not just about science and innovation, it’s about state capacity. Anyone who longs for renewed, effective institutions will find the wisdom of a kindred spirit reflecting on how to build them. Eli Dourado economist and senior research fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University Pieces of the Action provides a window into the way Bush saw himself: as part of a larger cultural tradition, equipping new generations with knowledge from past ones. I came away encouraged and inspired by the knowledge that great things can be built in spite of stagnation, rigid norms, and conventions, through the determination and foresight of people who work to change institutions—and build new ones, too. Saloni Dattani cofounder and editor of Works in Progress and researcher at Our World in Data Scientific and technological progress depend crucially on leadership. Bush understood this better than anyone, and he had a front-row seat to the most important R&D work of the 20th century. This candid memoir gave me a better understanding of how research leadership works and why it’s desperately needed. Jason Crawford writer at The Roots of Progress It’s hard to deny that Vannevar Bush was at the nexus of an astounding number of people and events that shaped the modern world. In Pieces of the Action, he works hard to give us a window into his thought processes, and from them distill timeless lessons about leadership, research, institution building, and human nature. Ben Reinhardt CEO of PARPA, researcher at the Astera Institute, and host of the Idea Machines podcast Pieces of the Action catalogs the scientists and engineers who were pivotal to an Allied victory in World War II—and how the ad-hoc organizations born out of that crisis ultimately provided the blueprints for our modern scientific institutions. If you want to understand the ‘man in the arena’ at the center of it all, this discursive, blunt, and often funny memoir is the best place to start. Alec Stapp cofounder and co-CEO of the Institute for Progress Pieces of the Action is an often-whimsical ride through time and the mind of the man whose insight, strategic instincts, and institutional empire-building formed the basis of the modern scientific state. One comes away with a view of scientific development that is anything but linear: the gravitational weight of historical contingencies, idiosyncratic personnel, and key management decisions described in Pieces of the Action continue to profoundly impact us today. Caleb Watney cofounder and co-CEO of the Institute for Progress In Where Is My Flying Car?, engineer and futurist J. Storrs Hall sets out to answer the deceptively simple question posed in the book’s title. What starts as an exploration of the technical limitations of building flying cars evolves into an examination of the global economic stagnation that started in the 1970s. From the failure to adopt nuclear energy and the suppression of cold fusion and nanotechnology to the rise of a counterculture hostile to progress, Hall recounts how our collective ambitions for the future were derailed, with devastating consequences for global wealth creation and distribution. Hall then outlines a framework for a future powered by exponential progress—one in which we build as much in the world of atoms as we do in the world of bits, one rich in abundance and wonder. J. Storrs Hall, Ph.D., is an independent scientist and author. He was the founding chief scientist of Nanorex, Inc. and a president of the Foresight Institute and is currently a research fellow at the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing and an associate editor of the International Journal of Nanotechnology and Molecular Computation. He was also accredited as an expert reviewer for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the field of computational climate models. His previous books include Beyond AI: Creating the Conscience of the Machine and Nanofuture: What’s Next for Nanotechnology. Now residing on Chesapeake Bay, he dabbles in aerodynamics design under the auspices of Eastern Shore Flying Cars, LLC. There are many writers with optimistic visions of the future. However, the goals I most often hear are all the negation of negatives: cure cancer, eliminate poverty, stop climate change. . . . This is good, but it is not enough. [These techno-optimists] are content with bringing the whole world up to the current best standard of living, but not increasing it. In this context, I found Where Is My Flying Car? refreshing. Hall unabashedly calls for unlimited progress in every dimension. Jason Crawford founder and CEO of Roots of Progress One of the best and most interesting books on technology. Tyler Cowen professor of economics at George Mason University and cowriter of Marginal Revolution Whether there is ‘tech stagnation’ or a revolution about to swarm the skies, Where Is My Flying Car? offers piercing questions and answers about what it might take to make the dream come true. David Brin author of Existence and The Postman While Silicon Valley is synonymous with software, its beginnings were driven by a need for a better class of hardware. Michael S. Malone’s The Big Score is a panoramic history of Silicon Valley’s founding days—written as they were still playing out in 1985. One of the first reporters on the tech industry beat, Malone recounts the feverish efforts of technologists and entrepreneurs to build something that would change the world. Starting with the birth of the semiconductor in the 1930s, he illustrates how decades of technological innovation laid the foundation for the meteoric rise of the Valley in the 1970s. Malone punctuates this history with profiles of tech’s early builders, capturing the high-agency spirit that shaped the electronics revolution. A decades-long story with individual sacrifice and ingenuity at its core, The Big Score recounts the history of today’s most dynamic sector through its upstart beginnings. Michael S. Malone has covered Silicon Valley and tech for over 30 years. His articles and editorials have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Economist, Fortune, New York Times, and San Jose Mercury-News. He has written or co-authored more than 25 award-winning books, including Bill and Dave and The Intel Trinity, and coproduced The New Heroes, an Emmy-nominated miniseries on social entrepreneurs. He lives in Palo Alto, California. Mike Malone’s epic depiction of Silicon Valley was a calling card for me and countless other young entrepreneurs with a background in tech. Malone’s stories captured the essence of Valley culture and the many outsize personalities who helped create this mecca of tech. Years later, this book is still relevant, and offers insights into the Valley and its ongoing place in the world. Jeff Skoll first president of eBay Mike Malone is the gold standard for telling Silicon Valley’s history. He has witnessed the evolution of the Valley from fruit groves to office parks, and has catalogued the world’s dependency on the Valley’s innovative technology. Experience the growth of Silicon Valley through the eyes of a pioneer, friend, reporter, and mentor to so many of us early Valley entrepreneurs. Sandy Kurtzig founder, CEO, and chairman of ASK Group From the Valley’s deep roots in the semiconductor industry to the rise of startups and venture capital, and the emergence of new models of management, The Big Score documents the beginnings of a technological transformation. When the book was first published, the microprocessor was kick-starting the computer industry. Today, our greatest innovators continue to build on the work of these early pioneers. John Hennessy president emeritus of Stanford University and chairman, Alphabet Inc. So rich was the scientific harvest of the early 20th century that it transformed entire industries and economies. Max Planck laid the foundation for quantum physics, Barbara McClintock for modern genetics, Linus Pauling for chemistry—the list goes on. But in the 1970s, the nature and pace of scientific discovery began to stagnate due to a combination of peer review, mandated justification of spending, and the push for short-term miracles. In Scientific Freedom, first published in 2008, Donald W. Braben presents a framework to find and support transformative scientific innovation. Even in the earliest stages, groundbreaking research can look unrecognizable to those who are accustomed to the patterns established by the past. As Braben argues, support for this research requires rethinking the processes used to discover and sponsor scientists with revolutionary ideas—and then giving them the freedom to explore. Donald W. Braben is a scientist and author. From 1980 to 1990, he led British Petroleum’s Venture Research program, for which he developed a radical, low-cost approach to finding and funding researchers whose work might redefine their fields. He currently holds an honorary position at University College London. A superb book, both inspiring and provocative. Braben strives to ensure that the most creative scientists, if completely free to pursue unorthodox research, will aim to attain the ‘elixir of civilization.’ Dudley Herschbach Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1986 All scientists, granting agencies, and policymakers should read this refreshing book and respond to the need to change current funding paradigms. Sir Richard J. Roberts Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1993 Braben has long held visionary views of how to fund the most innovative and creative science. It cannot be denied that, with the right financial support, his approach can be made to work spectacularly. Sir Martyn Poliakoff University of Nottingham, Michael Faraday Prize 2019 A sobering (but hopeful!) exploration of the stagnation in what I would call ‘paradigm shifting research’ and what to do about it. Ben Reinhardt Braben does an excellent job of highlighting the need to reassess the selection criteria used to decide what scientific projects receive funding. Quarterly Review of Biology Over the last 20 years, open source software has undergone a significant shift—from providing an optimistic model for public collaboration to undergoing constant maintenance by the often unseen solo operators who write and publish the code that millions of users rely on every day. In Working in Public, Nadia Eghbal takes an inside look at modern open source software development, its evolution over the last two decades, and its ramifications for an internet reorienting itself around individual creators. By delineating the structure of open source projects, she explores, for the first time, the maintenance costs of production that software incurs for its developers. Drawing on hundreds of developer interviews and analyses of platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, and YouTube, Eghbal argues that examining who produces things on the internet, and not just what they produce, helps us understand the value of online content today. Nadia Eghbal is a writer and researcher who explores how the internet enables individual creators. From 2015 to 2019, she worked independently and at GitHub to improve the open source developer experience. She is the author of “Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure,” published by the Ford Foundation. Nadia writes from a unique perspective at the intersection of open source, economics, and poetry. This is the definitive book on the dynamics of online creative communities. Nat Friedman CEO of GitHub Nadia is one of today’s most nuanced thinkers about the depth and potential of online communities. This book could not have come at a better time, as the ways we relate to each other have become more sharply mediated by the internet. Devon Zuegel former director of product for communities at GitHub In the age of information abundance, we’re all maintainers now. Working in Public is an anthropological dive into the stories of real developers, providing us a way to ask new questions through the lens of open source. Nadia presents us with a book that isn’t focused on just money, licenses, or code, but which is for all of us who make, as creators of all kinds. Henry Zhu maintainer of Babel Working in Public [is] a fascinating book . . . . We need to rethink the very idea of what crowdsourcing is capable of—and understand that it is perhaps more limited than promised. The open source revolution has been carried on the backs of some very weary people. Wired Eghbal clearly sees and articulates something important about the way we make things, and how that’s changing. . . .Working in Public opens by challenging a common perception about open source today: the idea that it’s collaborative. Alex Danco What inspires a great idea? Can we train our thinking to develop world-changing understandings and insights? Richard Hamming would say yes. In The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, he elaborates on his seminal essay “You and Your Research,” a provocative challenge to anyone who wants to build something great, and offers a manual of style for how to get there. Playfully framed as a textbook, and rich in its recounting of influential individuals like Albert Einstein and Grace Hopper, this unorthodox memoir by the seminal mathematician and engineer encourages the reader to aspire to, learn from, and surpass the achievements of yesterday’s greatest minds. This edition includes the original 1996 compilation of Hamming’s lectures for the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, along with a new foreword by designer and engineer Bret Victor and more than 70 redrawn graphs and charts. Richard W. Hamming (1915–1998) was a scientist and mathematician who discovered formulas that allow computers to correct their own errors. He provided crucial programming support to the Manhattan Project, and later joined Bell Labs. In 1968, he received the Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science. Hamming is here to tell you about excellence. His lessons unfold through personal stories of discovery and failure—life as an extraordinary scientist. But Hamming demands that you do extraordinary work, too, and for that he offers the best advice I know. Andy Matuschak software engineer, designer, and researcher Hamming was always as much a teacher as a scientist, and, having spent a lifetime forming and confirming a theory of great people, he felt he could prepare the next generation for even greater greatness. That’s the premise and promise of this book. Bret Victor founder of Dynamicland Your last chance to read the thinking of one of the major intellects that the U.S.A. has produced. Eugene N. Miya NASA researcher [Hamming] was one of the last geniuses who believed in innovation as a shared public project. New Yorker, which named The Art of Doing Science and Engineering a best book of 2020 Before Prince of Persia was a bestselling video game franchise and a Disney movie, it was an Apple II computer game created and programmed by a lone developer, Jordan Mechner. Mechner’s candid and revealing journals from the time capture the journey from his parents’ basement to the forefront of the fast-growing 1980s video game industry, as a 20-year-old fresh out of college with a liberal arts degree—and the creative, technical, personal, and professional struggles that brought the Prince into the homes of millions of people worldwide. In The Making of Prince of Persia, on the 30th anniversary of the game’s release, Mechner looks back at the journals he kept from 1985 to 1993 and annotates them with insights into the game that established him as a pioneer of cinematic storytelling in the industry. Jordan Mechner is a game designer, screenwriter, and author. His other books include the sketchbook journal Year 2 in France and the Eisner Award-nominated graphic novel Templar, a New York Times bestseller illustrated by LeUyen Pham and Alex Puvilland. Prince of Persia was the first computer game I ever fell in love with. Mechner’s journey is a universal one for anyone creating something brand-new, and it brought me back to the early, crazy days of building Instagram. Mike Krieger cofounder of Instagram Mechner’s journals are a unique record from the birth of an industry. The Making of Prince of Persia is also an unvarnished window into the creative process, with all its excitement, toil, setbacks, doubts, and triumphs. A fantastic read. D.B. Weiss cocreator of HBO’s Game of Thrones Probably my favorite book on game development. Neil Druckmann writer and director of The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 It’s a genuinely delightful book, even if you don’t care about the history of video games. . . .To read Mechner’s contemporaneous logs of his wrestling with his tools and machines is to take a journey back to a heroic age of games authorship. Cory Doctorow The best biography I’ve ever read. Applied Divinity Studies Although communities feel magical, they don’t come together by magic. Whether starting a run crew, connecting with fans online, or sparking a movement of K-12 teachers, the secret to getting people together is to build your community with people, not for them. In Get Together, the founders of the community strategy agency People & Company—Bailey Richardson, Kevin Huynh, and Kai Elmer Sotto—provide a practical and heartfelt guide to create thriving communities, both in person and online. The authors break down into clear steps the challenges of getting passionate people together, help individuals and organizations navigate the intricacies of leading a community, and share true stories of everyday people who have created vibrant communities. Get Together shows that if we join forces—as company and customers, artist and fans, organizer and advocates—we’ll do more together than we ever could alone. Bailey Richardson, Kevin Huynh, and Kai Elmer Sotto founded People & Company, which helps organizations build communities. In 2021, People & Company was acquired by Substack. I highly recommend Get Together for anyone who’s looking to crack the code on building a community. Alisha Ramos founder of Girls’ Night In Get Together is a generous, practical, and heartfelt guide to creating community in the digital age. With no jargon and no nonsense, Bailey, Kevin, and Kai lay out simple steps for helping people come together in meaningful and powerful ways. Dave Isay founder of StoryCorps Get Together tells the stories and reveals the insights of community building. Don’t start one without reading this book. Robert Wang founder of Instant Pot While management is foundational to any organization, engineering management in particular presents its own set of challenges—especially in high-growth environments. How and when should your engineers pay down technical debt? How do you tackle a seemingly endless stream of migrations? How do you ensure that each engineer on your team is growing at the right pace? Will Larson’s An Elegant Puzzle explores the specific challenges of engineering management—from sizing teams to handling technical debt to developing succession planning—and provides a guide to solving complex managerial problems. Drawing on his experience at Digg, Uber, and Stripe, Larson presents a thoughtful approach to engineering management that balances structured principles with human-centric thinking. A useful primer for engineering leaders of all levels at companies of all sizes, An Elegant Puzzle lays out a road map for building organizations where engineers can thrive. Will Larson has been an engineering leader at technology companies including Yahoo, Digg, Uber, Stripe, and Calm. An Elegant Puzzle draws from writing on his blog, Irrational Exuberance. He is also the author of the book Staff Engineer. An Elegant Puzzle is a masterful study of the challenges and demands of the discipline of engineering management, viewed through the prism of systems thinking. Readers can expect an actionable template for addressing complex problems with finesse, creativity, and fairness. Cindy Sridharan distributed systems engineer and author of Distributed Systems Observability Software engineering is evolving faster than ever before. In An Elegant Puzzle, Will Larson captures the timeless spirit of creative problem-solving that draws us to software engineering, while also providing concrete strategies for modern organizations. Jeffrey Meyerson host of the Software Engineering Daily podcast Engineering managers can often feel like they are struggling to keep their heads above the water. Our technical training is missing the frameworks and tools needed to build healthy and productive teams. The insights and step-by-step approach covered in An Elegant Puzzle will become your favorite go-to resource. Oren Ellenbogen VP of engineering at Forter An Elegant Puzzle is to date the most hands-on perspective on engineering management within a high-growth, tech-first organization, that I have read. . . .[It] is not just for engineering managers: product managers and engineers working at high-growth companies will find it a good read. Gergely Orosz Larson captures the timeless spirit of creative problem-solving that draws us to software engineering while also providing concrete strategies for modern organizations. Software Engineering Daily When it comes to the flow of information, technology has categorically reversed the balance of power between the public and the elites who manage the great hierarchical institutions of the industrial age—government, political parties, and the media. In The Revolt of the Public, Martin Gurri tells the story of how insurgencies, enabled by digital devices and a vast information sphere, have mobilized millions of ordinary people around the world. Originally published in 2014, The Revolt of the Public now appears in an updated edition, which includes an extensive analysis of Donald Trump’s improbable rise to the presidency and the electoral triumphs of Brexit. Gurri concludes with a look forward, considering whether the current elite class can bring about a reformation of the democratic process, and whether new organizing principles, adapted to a digital world, can arise out of the present political turbulence. Martin Gurri is a geopolitical analyst who specializes in the relationship between politics and global media. He spent 28 years analyzing open media at the CIA. The Revolt of the Public draws from writing on his blog, The Fifth Wave. All over the world, elite institutions, from governments to media to academia, are losing their authority and monopoly control of information to the broader public. This book has been my No. 1 handout to anyone seeking to understand this unfolding shift in power from hierarchies to networks in the age of the internet. Marc Andreessen cofounder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz Martin Gurri saw it coming. When, without fanfare, he self-published the first edition in June of 2014, he did not specifically name Donald Trump or Brexit. But he saw how the internet in general and social media in particular were transforming the political landscape. Arnold Kling economist and writer We are in an open war between publics with passionate and untutored interests and elites who believe they have the right to guide those publics. Gurri asks the essential question: Can liberal representative democracy survive the rise of the publics? Roger Berkowitz founder of the Hannah Arendt Center and professor of politics and human rights at Bard College “The internet has been a marvelous invention in lots of ways, but it has also unleashed a tsunami of misinformation and destabilized political systems across the globe. Martin Gurri . . . was way ahead of the curve on this problem. Vox Mr. Gurri writes that the internet has empowered ordinary citizens by giving them new information and tools, which they then use to discover the flaws in the systems and institutions that govern their lives. New York Times Throughout history, economic growth has alleviated human misery, improved human happiness and opportunity, expanded political rights, and lengthened human lives. If we want to prolong growth trends and the overwhelmingly positive outcomes for societies that come with them, every individual must become more concerned with the welfare of those around us. So how do we enable such altruism? In Stubborn Attachments—a culmination of 20 years of philosophical and economic thinking and research—Tyler Cowen argues that reason and common sense can help free us of the faulty ideas that hold us back as people and as a society, allowing us to set our sights on the long-term struggles that maximize sustainable economic growth while respecting human rights. At its heart, Stubborn Attachments makes the contemporary moral case for economic growth and delivers a dose of inspiration and optimism about the future. Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and director of the Mercatus Center. He was named in an Economist poll as one of the most influential economists of the past decade. He is the author of several books, including the New York Times bestseller The Great Stagnation, and is an opinion columnist at Bloomberg. He also cowrites the blog Marginal Revolution and hosts the podcast Conversations with Tyler. Most of Tyler’s books will change how you see the world in a myriad of small ways. Stubborn Attachments might well change the way you see the world in one very big way. Whether you agree or disagree with Tyler’s argument, I think you’ll find that following the logic in Stubborn Attachments is as fun as it is intellectually provocative. Cardiff Garcia cohost of the NPR podcast The Indicator from Planet Money Tyler Cowen is a national treasure, and Stubborn Attachments is brimming with deep insights–about the immense importance of economic growth, moral obligations, rights, and how to think about the future. It’s a book for right now, and a book for all times. A magnificent achievement. Cass R. Sunstein Robert Walmsley University Professor at Harvard and bestselling author of Nudge Tyler Cowen is one of the most intriguing and eclectic thinkers on the planet—like many people, I read something by him every day. In Stubborn Attachments, he combines economics and philosophy in a truly important achievement. His best, most ambitious, and most personal work. Tim Harford author of The Undercover Economist The thing about economic growth, Cowen tells us, is that it has the potential to advance just about everything that people value. . . .There is considerable evidence supporting the commonsense view that citizens of rich countries are happier than citizens of poor countries, and that, within rich countries, wealthier individuals are happier than poorer ones. New Yorker Stubborn Attachments is a philosophy book. . . .[Tyler] doesn’t try to set out an absolute, formalistic, fully internally consistent system of ethical principles—instead, he embraces an eclectic, often conflicting set of principles. This is refreshing, since rigid systems always prove fragile to intuitive counterexamples. Noah Smith Stubborn Attachments presents a compelling case for redefining our long-term priorities in favor of more sustained economic growth and a greater respect for human rights. Los Angeles Review of Books Behind every great revolution is a vision, and behind one of the greatest revolutions of our time—personal computing—is the vision of J. C. R. Licklider. He wasn’t an engineer and he didn’t start a company or write code; instead, he was a relentless visionary who saw great potential in the way individuals could interact with computers and software. At a time when computers were a short step removed from mechanical data processors, Licklider was an enthusiastic catalyst for the seminal research that ultimately led to the internet. In a simultaneously compelling personal narrative and comprehensive historical exposition, The Dream Machine by M. Mitchell Waldrop tells the story of the birth of the computing revolution through the life of a man who shifted our understanding of what computers were and could be. Originally published in 2001, the book now appears in a new edition, which includes the original texts of Licklider’s three most influential writings. M. Mitchell Waldrop earned a PhD in elementary particle physics and a master’s in journalism at the University of Wisconsin. He has been a writer and editor at Science and Nature. He is the author of Man-Made Minds (1987), a book about artificial intelligence, and Complexity (1992), about the new sciences of complexity. When people ask me about Xerox PARC, I always tell them about J. C. R. Licklider—‘Lick’—and how he started the great research funding for interactive computing and pervasive worldwide networks, which have resulted in most of the technology we use today. The top book I recommend to read about this large process, which stretched over 20 years, is The Dream Machine by Mitchell Waldrop. Alan Kay computer scientist A masterpiece! A mesmerizing but balanced and comprehensive look at the making of the information revolution—the people, the ideas, the tensions, and the hurdles. John Seely Brown former director of Xerox PARC A sprawling history of the ideas, individuals, and groups of people that got us from punch cards to personal computers . . . impressive . . . compelling. New York Times The Dream Machine works admirably as an exploration of the intellectual and political roots of the rise of modern computing. It’s an ambitious and worthwhile addition to the history of science. San Francisco Chronicle Global technology executive, serial entrepreneur, and angel investor Elad Gil has worked with high-growth tech companies like Airbnb, Twitter, Google, Stripe, and Square as they’ve scaled from small companies to global enterprises. Across all of these companies, Gil has identified a set of common patterns, and compiled them into a repeatable playbook in High Growth Handbook. In this definitive guide, he covers key topics for scaling startups from 10 or 20 employees to thousands, including the role of the CEO, board management, recruitment and management of executive teams, M&A, IPOs, and late-stage funding. Informed by interviews with some of the most dynamic leaders in Silicon Valley, including Reid Hoffman, Marc Andreessen, and Aaron Levie, High Growth Handbook presents a road map for navigating the most complex challenges that confront leaders and operators in high-growth startups. Elad Gil is an entrepreneur, operating executive, and investor or adviser to private companies such as Airbnb, Coinbase, Checkr, Gusto, Instacart, Opendoor, Pinterest, Square, Stripe, Wish, and others. He is co-founder and chairman at Color Genomics. High Growth Handbook draws from writing on his blog. Elad Gil is one of Silicon Valley’s seriously knowledgeable and battle-tested players.

Reid Hoffman cofounder of LinkedIn Elad jam-packs every useful lesson about building and scaling companies into a single, digestible book. Aaron Levie cofounder and CEO of Box Armed with observations gathered while scaling some of the most successful and important companies of Silicon Valley, Elad has no-nonsense, highly applicable advice for any operator transitioning a company from the proverbial garage to the next stage, and beyond. Max Levchin cofounder and CEO of Affirm, cofounder and former CTO of PayPal Many founders eventually face a moment in their company’s journey when they’ll need to scale the company and think much longer-term about success. Mr. Gil’s book walks founders through some of the steps and challenges they’ll face, such as the role of a board, mergers and acquisitions and more. Wall Street Journal “We are as gods and might as well get good at it,” wrote Stewart Brand in 1968, as the opening sentence to the now iconic Whole Earth Catalog. For decades, Brand has had an uncanny ability to push “ideas that seem at the edge of believability,” accelerating progress in culture, technology, environmentalism, and more. His approach to work and life influenced many technologists who have gone on to shape our modern world, including Steve Jobs. We Are As Gods, produced by Stripe Press, is the first feature film about Brand’s remarkable life. Marrying never-before-seen footage with contemporary interviews, the film chronicles his journey, from his early days with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters through the birth of the personal computing revolution, to his latest quest to reorient environmentalism. The original score was composed by experimental musician and artist Brian Eno, who’s collaborated with artists such as David Bowie, the Talking Heads, and U2. Along with Brand, Eno is a founding board member of the Long Now Foundation, whose mission is to foster long-term thinking and responsibility. He contributed 24 original tracks, in addition to some classics. Infrastructure is—finally—having its moment. From transit systems to supply chains, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and others are evaluating whether our civic infrastructure is up to the task of supporting a growing—and warming—globe. In each episode of Beneath the Surface, we explore some of the most complicated challenges facing our world, and talk to the people who are rolling up their sleeves to build solutions. The New Atlantis: Charter cities Each year, tens of millions of people migrate from rural areas to cities—mostly in emerging economies, where populations are growing faster than governments can create basic infrastructure. To address the challenges of urbanization without industrialization, development experts, economists, and policymakers have proposed solutions spanning from increased immigration to better family planning. In this episode, we ask: could charter cities—a model inspired by the successes of places like Singapore and Shenzhen—be a path to accelerating growth in emerging economies? Founder and managing partner, Pronomos Capital Founder and former executive director of the Charter Cities Institute Founder and co-managing partner of Thebe Investment Management PhD candidate at McGill University Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto, and author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Juan Du, Dean of the University of Toronto School of Architecture, discuss Du’s book, The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City—and the many myths that surround the city’s origin and development. Salton Sea: White Gold in the California Desert In 1905, an engineering accident created one of the largest lakes in the United States: the Salton Sea. Now, more than 100 years later, the lake is shrinking, and has become one of the most polluted bodies of water in the US. But the area is also poised to become the largest lithium mine in the country—to be used by GM, Tesla, and Ford to manufacture their electric vehicles. Still, there’s an inherent tension between mining heavy metals—often a dirty, high-pollution process, for environmentally beneficial purposes. In this episode, we explore the future of energy production, how boom and bust cycles affect cities and communities, and the often overlooked environmental considerations that roil the development of green infrastructure. Author of Queen of the Salton Sea: Helen Burns and Me Journalist at VICE Research Professor at University of California, Riverside Founder of Saving the Salton Sea and director of the Salton Sea Film Festival Audrey Carleton, environmental journalist for VICE, discusses the potential for lithium extraction at the Salton Sea to catalyze the burgeoning electric vehicle industry, the parallels to the oil and gas industries, and what it all means for the area's residents. The Industrial Ballet: An Investigation into Global Supply Chains Thanks to the global supply chain crisis, millions of consumer goods, from computer chips to couches to cell phones are in high demand but short supply. It would be tempting to think that the pandemic is the main culprit for the backup of global trade flows—but COVID merely exposed existing fault lines in our infrastructure. The advent of just-in-time manufacturing and a relentless focus on short-term earnings have left companies with little inventory in case of emergencies, making our supply chains less resilient. Ryan Petersen—CEO of Flexport, which manages global trade and logistics for some of the largest companies in the world—has some thoughts about how we can fix that. You Say You Want to Build More Housing The price of housing in major cities has, over the past few decades, far outpaced the cost of construction. Average New York City metropolitan area house prices are up 706% since 1980 (or 376% more than US consumer prices, and 326% more than US wages). For San Francisco the rise is 932%. In Ireland, prices have risen by about 800% in that period, driven by increases in Dublin in particular. The immediate effects of the housing crunch are generally well-understood: productivity suffers when people aren’t able to live near the jobs they want. But there are other, less-explored effects of the crunch: an increase in obesity (as folks become more sedentary due to longer commutes and a lack of walkable suburbs), a decrease in birth rates (as housing is often the biggest expense for families, making it difficult to realize their ideal family size), climate change, and inequity. Still, there are reasons to be optimistic. Advocates of building more housing are gaining important victories all around the world—but it remains to be seen whether or not these victories will prove to be lasting. Head of the Urbanity Project at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University Founder of YIMBY Action Associate Professor of Economics at Trinity College Dublin Community leaders in the North London Haredi community In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Ronan Lyons, Associate Professor in Economics at Trinity College Dublin, discuss Ireland’s economic development, the current challenges facing would-be homeowners and renters in Dublin, and the time the biggest concern in the Irish housing market was too much supply. Growing Pains and Bullet Trains: The Art and Science of Moving People In 2016, the much-anticipated Second Avenue Subway line opened in Manhattan, New York. It took nearly a century to finish, and it was the most expensive per-mile subway project… ever—a rare new addition to one of the largest and the oldest subway systems in the world. By contrast, half a world away, Tokyo has a sprawling web of commuter trains—boasting the 50 busiest train stations in the world. Yet today, even the busiest lines in Tokyo only experience a yearly average delay of 20 seconds—and minimal incidents. How did Tokyo manage to avoid the friction common in the transit systems of other megacities? In this episode, we examine how officials in post WWII-Japan created one of the most efficient examples of scaled infrastructure in the modern world—and what cities around the world can learn from them. Author of Pedestrian Observations and the Transit Costs project Associate Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University Pioneer Valley Planning Commission, Springfield, Massachusetts Train journalist and writer of How to Enjoy Railroads From Train Schedules. In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Alex Forrest, transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts, discuss the history of transit in the US, the relationship between transit and housing prices, and the formative years Forrest spent in Japan—and how they’ve shaped his current work in Springfield. People and Ideas: Populations as Infrastructure Up to now, we’ve explored physical infrastructure: supply chains, housing, transportation, and more. But the ultimate resource for any country is its people. For most of human history, populations were fairly stable. Then, in the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution precipitated an exponential increase in population, which reached a peak in the mid-20th century. Today, however, the demographic outlook in many developed countries is the opposite: birth rates around the world have fallen below the replacement rate. In this episode, we explore the effects of declining birth rates and what, if anything, could be done to reverse them. Along the way, we’ll dig into one of the thorniest questions about population growth: what happens when governments try to influence it through policy? Assistant Professor of Quantitative Analysis, Samford University Economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and Fellow at NYU Law Author of Slow Boring and One Billion Americans Retired Teacher, English Language Institute of Singapore Retired Quantity Surveyor In this conversation, Shruti Rajagopalan, Head of India Policy Research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and host Tamara Winter discuss Shruti's research on how population growth can accelerate economic development, the unintended consequences of fertility policy, and why 1991 was a pivotal year for India.

Wooo! Finally we got lights. Tamara Winter: Lagos, Nigeria is one of the largest cities in the world. It’s home to over 14 million people and one of Africa’s main economic hubs. It’s the most populous city in the country with Africa’s largest GDP. However in Lagos, even basic services are unreliable. Archived audio: Everything comes to life when there’s light. When there’s no light you can literally feel handicapped. Tamara Winter: This isn’t a new problem in Lagos. An unstable power grid and political corruption make providing everyday utilities—like electricity—a struggle. In 2016, The Guardian reported on a neighborhood that went without power for five years because its residents refused to pay bribes. These kinds of challenges are not unique to Lagos or even to Nigeria. Across the developing world—from Jakarta to Kinshasa—cities are growing rapidly. New residents are pouring into cities that have neither the infrastructure nor the institutions to adequately serve them. In his 2005 book Planet of Slums urban theorist Mike Davis chronicled the rise of million-person cities in the developing world. He described the lives of the more than one billion people who live in the world’s slums. Booming populations of these fast-growing cities find themselves in harsh living conditions. Flooded streets. Poor ventilation. Little to no waste clearance. And few basic services. The absence of infrastructure makes life dangerous. Lack of access to sanitation and healthcare are directly responsible for high infant and maternal mortality. Communicable diseases—that have become a thing of the past elsewhere—run rampant. Despite these challenges, people across the developing world are seeking out the economic opportunities that cities provide. So, is there another way? Another avenue for people in search of a better life to access not only economic opportunities, but also stable governance and reliable institutions. In this episode, we’ll be looking at one possible solution: charter cities. Built—sometimes almost from scratch—in developing countries. These developments are outside-the-box infrastructure. Rather than reforming or building on existing cities they are new constructions often with their own economic regulations and laws. Privately backed. And focused on bringing economic growth to emerging economies. Supporters see them as a way to theoretically seed the ground for more stable institutions and improved governance. Hello and welcome to the first episode of Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press exploring new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. It’s not an accident that the first episode begins in Nigeria. That’s where I was born. My family moved to the United States when I was just two months old. But growing up in Texas I often wondered: what if instead of being raised in Dallas, I grew up in Lagos, like the majority of my family? That question is part of why I’ve always been so fascinated by questions about development and specifically, about Africa’s trajectory. It’s part of my story. I’m also no stranger to the world of new cities. I used to work at the Charter Cities Institute. We’ll actually hear from the institute’s founder Mark Lutter a little later in this episode. The Institute, based in Washington D.C. is a non-profit that’s working to build the ecosystem for charter cities by developing institutional frameworks that can guide their creation. Now, before we get into the nitty gritty, I want to be really clear about some of the words we’re using in this episode. You’ve already heard me say ‘new cities’ and ‘charter cities.’ There’s a pretty broad ecosystem of new city projects. So when we’re talking about the whole landscape, I’ll use the term ‘new cities’—charter cities are just one part of that world, the part most focused on leveraging the creation of new cities for global development. So, what are charter cities and where did the idea for them come from in the first place? If you spend any amount of time talking to folks about new cities there’s one name that will keep popping up. Person 1: Paul Romer Person 2: Paul Romer Person 3: Professor Paul Romer Tamara Winter: Paul. Romer. He’s not a household name, but he’s been one of the most influential economists in the world for the last 20 years. He’s a former Chief Economist at the World Bank and in 2018 he even won the Nobel Prize. Archived audio: Dear Professor Romer...the tools you have developed broaden the scope of economic analysis...I now ask you to receive your prizes from his Majesty the King. Tamara Winter: He’s a big deal—if you’re an economist. But that’s not why all these people mention his name. In 2009, he gave a TED Talk. Now this might not seem that exciting—an economist giving a 20 minute lecture about his new idea. In fact, if you watch the talk—it’s on YouTube—you might not walk away inspired to start a city of your own. Romer walks on stage his hair more salt than pepper and close-cropped, wearing blue jeans and a dark suit jacket over a button down shirt. He paces back and forth while he talks, a clicker in his right hand occasionally changing slides behind him. His voice is steady, not monotonous, but not an orator’s. The talk has been posted on YouTube for just over 12 years and has only a little more than 150,000 views. However, for many who saw this talk back in 2009, who were captivated by Romer’s ideas, it was an a-ha moment. Like when the Beatles first went on the Ed Sullivan show. Back in 1964 a generation of young music lovers saw four guys from Liverpool playing music on their TV and thought to themselves: maybe my friends and I can do that. Inspired by Romer’s talk, many entrepreneurs began wondering the same kind of thing—what if they could build charter cities too. So—Romer’s idea. Charter cities. New cosmopolitan growth centers that would promote economic development and connect developing countries to the rest of the global economy. Romer’s proposed cities would be more than special economic zones—areas with different economic regulations—they would also be special governance zones. Places where different laws would allow for faster economic growth thanks to better institutions. Romer imagined cities located in developing countries administered by the governments of developed countries. Now, more than 12 years after Romer’s talk, if you ask some of the people most involved with the movement what charter cities are, and what purposes they serve, you’ll get pretty different answers. Patri Friedman: I think of a charter city as a special jurisdiction that is a geographic area that has different laws and institutions from the rest of the country. And the amount of difference has to be more than a special economic zone which typically just has some tax breaks, tariff breaks, a small number of legal changes. Tamara Winter: That was Patri Friedman. He runs Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm which invests in new city projects. Their slogan: Better laws. Better lives. Oh, and if you caught that his last name is Friedman. Yeah, he’s the grandson of legendary economist Milton Friedman. He got his start in the world of new cities when he founded the Seasteading Institute. A non-profit that worked to establish autonomous communities on free-floating platforms stationed in international waters. Friedman’s interest in new cities came from his analysis of governance as a kind of product that should be subject to updates. Patri Friedman: Why do our cellphones get better every year and our governments maybe occasionally get better, maybe sometimes degrade and what I realized is that if you throw away all the morality and philosophy and say, “Okay this is an industry”, what characteristics does it have? Tamara Winter: Mark Lutter, the founder and executive director of the Charter Cities Institute has a slightly more technical definition of what constitutes a charter city. Mark Lutter: So a charter city is a new city development: a new city with better laws. Paul Romer, for example, was advocating that high-income countries such as Canada act as a guarantor in a low-income country such as Honduras. And the Charter Cities Institute moved away from this, I guess, this idea, this definition, arguing for a public-private partnership. Tamara Winter: Lutter founded the Charter Cities Institute just one year after finishing his PhD in economics. In his view, charter city developments, if and when successful, will have long term positive impacts beyond the cities themselves. Mark Lutter: Charter cities have primarily been focused on emerging markets, creating a space with new institutions. So this would be going to places like Nigeria, Zambia, Honduras and creating new city developments that allowed for people to be able to hire more easily to, resolve disputes more easily to pay taxes, to register a business, having a government that’s effective at providing public goods, and this would allow for sustained economic development over time. Tamara Winter: The Institute’s website lists some of the existing cities that they see as examples of this model—jurisdictions that improved their governance and, as a result, their economic output. Dubai. Singapore. Shenzhen. Hong Kong. These cities have all experienced astronomical growth in relatively short periods of time. The Charter Cities Institute’s website has a slideshow with before and after images of each city and information about their growth. The images that accompany these numbers are just as striking. Shenzhen in 1980 is a pastoral scene of green fields, rolling hills, and distant mountains—home to about 300,000 people. But by 2017, it is all sleek skyscrapers and glowing lights—a metropolis with a population to rival New York City. Oh, and the average yearly income increased over 10,000 percent, too. Browsing these figures. Listening to Friedman and Lutter. And hearing Romer’s optimism echoing from 2009, it’s easy to understand why so many people are so dedicated to promoting the idea of new cities. But what do these numbers really mean? Who are these cities being built by? And maybe more importantly, who are they being built for? I first met Mwiya Musokotwane on a trip to a remote island in Zambia. I was there as part of my work for the Charter Cities Institute. Mwiya’s a stoic, physically imposing guy, well over six feet tall. I’ve known him for a while now and he’s basically got two speeds: full suit and sweatsuit. He’s either in board rooms, meeting with elected officials, and giving presentations, or he’s at home being a doting dad, the kind who keeps a lot of pictures of his daughter in his pocket—and on his Instagram. He’s the co-managing partner, along with his father, of Thebe Investment Management and the founder of Nkwashi, a new charter city project in Zambia. Mwiya Musokotwane: Zambia, it’s kind of like the junction point between Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa, and like South Western Africa also. Lake Tanganyika which is the world’s second longest and second largest lake by volume is partly in Zambia. The source of the largest river in southern Africa is in Zambia so it’s at the confluence of these interesting things. Tamara Winter: Zambia’s natural resources, especially copper, made it a target for colonization. But Zambia had a distinctly different experience than its neighbors. Mwiya Musokotwane: You didn’t have very militarized colonial experience as was the case elsewhere in Kenya or in South Africa. So the British were very white glove here. I think part of that is Zambia was never really seen as a place where they were going to settle…it was seen as a resource country. Tamara Winter: The British occupied what they called “Northern Rhodesia” from the late 19th century all the way until 1964. After gaining freedom Zambia began to function as a democracy. However, within a decade of independence the country was under one-party rule. Mwiya Musokotwane: Seven years later became a single party socialist state, as was the fashion in Africa those days, and you know that was basically the beginning of a long and steady decline for the country. Tamara Winter: The economy was soon in crisis and actually contracted for decades. Mwiya Musokotwane: We ended up losing three to four times our GDP per capita over the 20 years of socialism that we experienced. And then people basically got to a point where they had enough and demanded liberal democracy again. Tamara Winter: After a series of coup attempts… Archived audio: Where the rebel officers had attempted to announce they had attempted to overthrow the government because it was corrupt. Tamara Winter: …and internal struggles in the 90s, that saw former leaders imprisoned… Archived audio Kenneth Kaunda: Today, God is great indeed. I am out, but I’ve not been told why I was in the prison for five months and seven days. Tamara Winter: Zambia has once again begun the move towards a multi-party democracy. Just last fall, Hakainde Hichilema, who ran for president six times in the last 15 years, was finally elected. As recently as 2017, he too spent time in prison, accused of treason for his role in anti-corruption protests against the former president. Now, Hichilema is committed to an ambitious agenda and has already begun traveling, connecting with other world leaders… Archived audio Kamala Harris: Well it is my honor and pleasure to welcome you, Mr. President, to the White House. Tamara Winter: …working to ensure that democracy in Zambia will be bolstered by strong national institutions and a renewed commitment to economic development. Archived audio Hakainde Hichilema: For us to be able to run our countries in a manner that would deliver what we may call democratic dividends. Kamala Harris: That’s right. Hakainde Hichilema: Delivering accelerated economic growth development to offer opportunities to our people. I think, Vice President, that’s what will sustain democracy. That’s what will make democracy attractive. Tamara Winter: Hichilema grew up in a farming family and spent years in international business. His presidency promises a new era for Zambia, one focused on economic growth and greater stability in the government. Mwiya, who was born in the late 80s, grew up watching Zambia’s economic and governance struggles first hand. Now in his early 30s he wants his investment firm to be an engine of development not just for Zambia, but for all of Africa. This vision drives Mwiya’s interest in Nkwashi. You can hear the same far-reaching desire when he explains why he wanted to build a city in the first place. Mwiya Musokotwane: I was asking myself, “how can I apply this to fix these problems as opposed to being a bystander?” I started thinking about the resources I had available to me. It just so happened that my family owned a ranch about a half-hour drive out of Lusaka and it was large enough that something meaningful could be done there. Tamara Winter: Mwiya mentioned Lusaka. That’s the capital city of Zambia and the largest city in the country with between two and three million residents. It’s a bit larger than Chicago and slightly smaller than Berlin. And the problems he’s talking about? Well, the city is growing fast—faster than many of its institutions can cope with. As recently as October of last year there were major blackouts across Zambia. Power isn’t the only element of infrastructure under strain in Lusaka. It’s estimated that by 2030, the city will have a shortage of three million homes. Part of Mwiya’s drive to build a new city nearby was to add another living and working hub: one that could be a home to professionals and those who want to connect more directly with the rest of the world. Mwiya Musokotwane: Nkwashi is a satellite town to Lusaka. We like to call it a knowledge city. We’re anchoring the city on institutions of learning and it’s been designed to be able to be a home to up to 100,000 people. Tamara Winter: Those learning institutions include a 130 acre university campus and the Explorer School which provides entirely online education for primary and secondary school. Archived audio: Imagine a school without borders. A school where students and teachers come from places all around the world from Bahrain to France, from Australia to Zambia. Tamara Winter: In Zambia it is common for the children of wealthier families to be educated outside of the country, in Johannesburg or even London, where Mwiya went to school. The Explorer School also reaches across borders with students in Nigeria, India and beyond but is anchored in Nkwashi. By creating learning institutions in Zambia that are internationally connected, Mwiya hopes there will be even more reason for those seeking economic and educational advancement to stay. Mwiya Musokotwane: We’re creating these institutions that hopefully can be the engines of initial economic growth. If Explorer School and Explorer Academy are fantastically successful that then creates the natural impetus to create city number two and three and four and five. Tamara Winter: Large scale new city projects like Nkwashi sit squarely at the intersection of public and private institutions. They are often so significant in scope that they require cooperation from local and national governments, in addition to willing investors. Luckily, Mwiya was prepared to navigate both of those worlds from an early age, whether or not he was fully aware of it. Mwiya Musokotwane: I didn’t really grow up with a very boxed-in view of the world. Tamara Winter: His parents made sure of that. His father is actually one of the architects of Zambia’s financial system. Mwiya Musokotwane: He’s like a super disciplined academic type person and he’s also been a central banker and economist and policy maker. A lot of the conversations he would have would be around things to do with how to develop Zambia. How to develop Africa at large. Tamara Winter: His mother was an entrepreneur. Mwiya Musokotwane: She had her own ways of conveying similar values to us. But most of hers were more practical so I think everything I learned about business as an example, I learned from her. Tamara Winter: Growing up in a household with international business interests meant an early window into the wider world. Mwiya Musokotwane: I would go with my parents on their trips to figure out different commercial undertakings they might want to get involved in like acquiring land and stuff like that at a super young age. It created this very like, explorer type mindset in me. I think that’s stuck with me into adulthood. Tamara Winter: But Mwiya was also an introverted kid who preferred his own company. Luckily at home he was in an environment that filled him with a fierce curiosity. His parents nurtured his development—each in their own way. For example, when he was 13 his father gave him a biography of Albert Einstein. His mother? Well, she gave him The Power of Positive Thinking. Mwiya Musokotwane: You know, where my dad is taciturn, she’s more expressive. Where his interests lie in more technical facts hers are much more to do with human wellbeing. He’s taught me how to build systems and she’s taught me how to lead those systems. Tamara Winter: And now, with a project like Nkwashi, Mwiya is combining lessons from both parents. Mwiya Musokotwane: Building cities and building institutions of learning...it sits right smack on the intersection between public sector and private sector work. Tamara Winter: These projects also take a hefty dose of confidence and that ‘explorer mindset’ that Mwiya described. Like Patri Friedman and Mark Lutter, Mwiya’s interest in new cities came from his dissatisfaction with the status-quo solutions he saw being offered to the structural problems in Zambia. Without Mwiya’s imagination, the land that is now becoming Nkwashi could have been put to more mundane use. Mwiya Musokotwane: There was the possibility of just subdividing allotments and then selling those, but that also felt very boring and like, low-impact. And the possibility of building something more meaningful seemed more interesting. So we’re like, “Okay we’re going to build a city.” Tamara Winter: In the red dirt and scrub brush, Mwiya saw something possibly transformational that could reach far beyond 3,000 acres outside of Lusaka. Mwiya Musokotwane: Right now what we have is a situation where Africans regardless of where they live in the world are treated as nominal equals. It’s one thing to be equal in the law, it’s another to be equal in the way someone regards you in their hearts. And I think that’s what places like Nkwashi represent for me. Tamara Winter: Mwyia’s clear sense of purpose in building Nkwashi is not always as easy to detect in the world of new cities. Nor is the seamless mix of public and private. That intersection can sometimes be an uncomfortable one. Remember, when Paul Romer proposed the notion of charter cities, he was clear: they would be special opportunity zones run by other governments. That idea met with almost instant backlash. Isabelle Simpson: The argument is that Paul Romer’s model was too neocolonial because he would have these foreign countries come and intervene, but that when it’s private entrepreneurs because they are not bound to a particular country that it’s not neocolonial. Tamara Winter: Isabelle Simpson is a PhD candidate at McGill University studying new cities and startup societies. Isabelle Simpson: But obviously from the perspective of the local people it is very much neocolonialism. Tamara Winter: Discomfort over foreign governments running cities in other countries is part of what spurred changes in how new cities are discussed and planned. Patri Friedman of Pronomos Capital—who we heard from earlier—is especially interested in thinking of new models for charter city development. Patri Friedman: That idea that a charter city is operated by a foreign power that just didn’t fly at all. So today’s charter cities are overseen by the host country and often are public private partnerships with companies that will build and operate the city. Tamara Winter: But this model presents challenges of its own. Patri Friedman: The gold standard right now is the Honduran ZEDE system. Tamara Winter: In Honduras, laws were passed to seed the ground for new city developments. Archived audio: Honduras has began to create two of the twelve regions of development and employment also known as charter cities. Tamara Winter: Called the ZEDE laws, they were so controversial they created a constitutional crisis, and inspired multiple protest movements. Local suspicion towards new city projects has been common in Honduras. One project, Prospera, has had ongoing tensions with the population that lives near its borders. Prospera has also been criticized for its legal system. A board of seven arbiters, many of them not native to Honduras, oversee private disputes in the city. They are asked to make rulings over residents who may or may not speak English and who are governed by a code that has borrowed liberally from different existing sets of laws. That’s a pretty extreme example. Mark Lutter, the director of the Charter Cities Institute, who you heard from at the beginning of the podcast, has been critical of this particular aspect of Prospera. Champions of new cities do, however, speak glowingly about the possibilities of these kinds of mix-and-match legal systems, ones that allow laws to be switched out and updated like software. From Patri Friedman. Patri Friedman: What’s interesting to me from an infrastructure perspective is that modifying other kinds of infrastructure—power systems or sewer systems of a city—is very, very difficult but law is a virtual layer so it can be modified the same way you deploy new software builds. Tamara Winter: And the sources for these new software builds? They can come from almost anywhere. Patri Friedman: It’s a really, really interesting point of leverage to say can we essentially write better operating systems or copy the existing operating systems, that is, copy functional sets of laws and administrative procedures from countries that work well and bring them to other countries. Tamara Winter: To critics of the new city movement this description of governance sounds too straightforward. It is emblematic of the tendency of charter city advocates to oversimplify complex issues. Isabelle Simpson goes all the way back to the first moments of Paul Romer’s original TED talk as an example. Isabelle Simpson: He begins this talk by showing an Associated Press photo of African students who are sitting under streetlights at an airport and they’re sort of bent over their textbooks. Archived audio Paul Romer: Take a look at this picture. It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us. Isabelle Simpson: So already I find this sort of annoying because people have this really bad habit when they want to illustrate dysfunction or chaos they use Africa. Archived audio Paul Romer: These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don’t have any electricity at home. Isabelle Simpson: And Romer does not mention that the students are from the Republic of Guinea and the airport is the international airport there. And the year is 2007. Archived audio Paul Romer: Let’s just pick one, for example the one in the green shirt. Isabelle Simpson: Romer then gives one of the students a fictive name, “We’re going to name him Nelson.” Archived audio Paul Romer: Nelson. Isabelle Simpson: I bet Nelson has a cellphone. Archived audio Paul Romer: I’ll bet Nelson has a cellphone. So here’s the puzzle. Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting edge technology like the cell phone, but doesn’t have access to a 100 year old technology for generating electric light in the home? Now in a word the answer is rules. Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that’s available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson. Isabelle Simpson: Actually the causes of electricity blackouts here are complex and a comprehensive explanation would have required Romer to address in addition to the poor tariff structures—what he says are the ‘bad rules’—he would have had to talk about the country’s weak infrastructure, issues of transmission and distribution losses, supply shortages and lack of diversity in the electricity generation mix, corruption distorting contract negotiation, and the neocolonial economic situation that thrives on extraction by foreign companies which are the ones grabbing the most electricity at the lowest price. All these complex elements, they don’t fit into Romer’s narrative about bad rules. Tamara Winter: The reason scholars like Simpson fear this simplification is because simple-sounding problems invite simple solutions that overlook necessary complexities. Isabelle Simpson: If you say that you want to build a new city what is it exactly that you mean by city? Isn’t a city a political space where people with different opinions and different ambitions will come and debate and sort of try to create this better society all the time? Or are you trying to create this community of like-minded people which ultimately is just sort of a gated community? Tamara Winter: In addition to political questions about new cities, there are also cultural and historical ones. Juan Du is the author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City. She’s also… Juan Du: …the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto. Tamara Winter: In her book, she pushes back on the popular narrative about Shenzhen: that until 1979 it was a sparsely populated backwater. And after government investment and its designation as a special economic zone only then did its population and economic output explode. Juan Du: I think it’s important to keep in mind what accounted for Shenzhen’s rapid population growth wasn’t necessarily just top-down policy, it was a bottom-up willingness that people wanted to go there. Tamara Winter: In her book, Du unpacks how Shenzhen’s history allowed it to rapidly transform into the megacity it is today. Juan Du: The centuries of history prior to 1979 is as important as the history of the last four decades. The incredible urbanization and economic growth in Shenzhen was built up on foundations that was already preexisting and those foundations took decades if not millennium to be built. Tamara Winter: Du also takes issue with many of the popular statistics about Shenzhen pre-1979 that feed the city-built-from-scratch narrative. Juan Du: People think that in 1979 it was just a small sleeping fishing village of 30,000. First of all, there are no villages that have 30,000, especially a sleepy one and a small one at that. Shenzhen was a conglomerate of 2,000 villages and several historic townships that existed for centuries. Tamara Winter: The population of that 2,000 village conglomerate? Closer to 300,000. And it was this preexisting network that ushered contemporary Shenzhen into being. Juan Du: There are so much local and indigenous knowledge and organizations and economies and local networks and international networks of those local indigenous villages that formed and actually allowed Shenzhen to survive its most difficult start up period at the first five years, the first ten years. Tamara Winter: The willingness in the new city world to downplay this part of Shenzhen’s story in favor of a more a-historical, top-down narrative worries Du. Juan Du: City making is a very, very complex and difficult process. The misconception that Shenzhen grew from scratch that it was a blank slate or a tabula rasa is, I think, the most dangerous misconception. That one can take zero, one can take a blank sheet of paper and that all you need to do is add money and policy that you can have a city. Tamara Winter: But looking at some proposed new city projects it seems like that’s exactly what certain investors hope to do. In 2020, Hong Kong real estate developer Ivan Ko proposed a creatively named new city “Nextpolis” to be located in Ireland and populated by residents of Hong Kong who wanted to escape that city’s increasingly challenging political environment. There was also a proposal in Singapore for a floating city that could house migrant workers and move, when needed, to be near construction projects. These simple-sounding solutions point to other important questions that need to be addressed in the new city ecosystem. Like who has a say in governance. Simpson points out that many of the cities cited as examples of new city developments—Shenzhen, Dubai, Singapore—are also those with restrictive, even authoritarian, national governments. Isabelle Simpson: It’s very bizarre that charter cities entrepreneurs would use this very authoritarian model as their blueprint for this sort of pro-free market, pro-freedom, individual freedom developments that they’re trying to do. Tamara Winter: One of the most high profile new city projects currently under construction— Saudi Arabia’s NEOM—fits this mold. Archived audio: The contemporary city needs a full redesign. What if we removed cars? What if we got rid of streets? What if we innovated in the public space? Tamara Winter: Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars of government money, this ambitious plan includes everything from automated ports, to city modules spread out over hundreds of miles of desert and connected by high-speed rail. Promotional materials make it sound almost irresistible. As one Wall Street Journal article put it: it’s Disneyland meets Dubai. Archived audio: Through advanced manufacturing methods we will create green industries of the future with sustainability and reusability built into their DNA. Because any business destined to change the world, must also protect it. Tamara Winter: NEOM is part of Saudi Vision 2030, the flagship project of the authoritarian Saudi government of Muhammed bin Salman. It has ruthlessly targeted journalists, activists, and critics at home and abroad. Isabelle Simpson: Entrepreneurs who are very insistent on freedom of association, freedom of movement, freedom of speech. Their model for charter cities are authoritarian countries. Tamara Winter: Nkwashi, however, is not this kind of project. It’s being built in Zambia by someone with deep roots in the country. And it is being supported by a new administration that is committed to using economic development to build more democratic institutions. Some form of government support is crucial in creating a new city. The projects that succeed will have both government support and a significant connection to the place where they are being built. Nkwashi has that connection. Even the name of the city speaks to its Zambian roots. Mwiya Musokotwane: It means eagle and so the Zambian national bird is the fish eagle and so we decided to name the city after the national bird and we chose to name it in a language that was indigenous to the area. Tamara Winter: However, these close ties don’t mean the city and the ideas that come along with it will be instantly adopted. Mwiya Musokotwane: I think people think of us as being fairly forward-thinking and maybe a little bit crazy sometimes, but I think in a good way. Tamara Winter: Some might view Nkwashi as ‘crazy’ but that hasn’t really harmed its popularity. Mwiya Musokotwane: And you know we sold out in like three months; that initial batch of I think 80 five-acre plots, it was. Tamara Winter: And Mwiya firmly believes in the mission behind Nkwashi—not just the city, but what it could represent. Mwiya Musokotwane: I see Nkwashi as a beta, as a proof of concept. Speaking as an African, I think one of the challenges Africa has had is we haven’t yet done really big interesting things as a continent—the kind of things where people look at them and say, “Oh wow that’s like super cool that has a lot of positive impact not just for Africa but for the world at large.” Tamara Winter: That drive to change perception is a personal one for Mwiya, shaped by experiences he had during his university years in London. At 17, he left Zambia, hopeful and a bit apprehensive. Tamara Winter: He made friends quickly and found community in the classroom. However, while in London he also experienced everyday racism. This might not sound that revelatory—a young African man encountering racism in early 2000s London. What makes these experiences so important is the way Mwiya talks about them. Mwiya Musokotwane: Running in the train station to catch the train and then policemen in the train station stop you like, “Where are you running to?” I’m in a train station, it’s obvious I’m going to catch a train. You know, it’s interactions like that where I felt like I was nominally equal. Tamara Winter: Did you catch that? Nominally equal. Mwiya uses the same words talking about these incidents as he does when describing the necessity of Nkwashi. If Nkwashi is proof of concept and other similar new cities can be built around Africa, Mwiya hopes that—in time—through the educational and institutional development they bring, the international perception of Africa and Africans can change. In the end, there are as many questions about the future of new cities now as there were twelve years ago when Romer gave his talk. Maybe even more since there are real projects being launched. I was once a die-hard evangelist for new cities, a true believer. I still see the promise in the model, but now I approach the subject with more humility. Basically I’m trying to remember how little I know about what the next decades of new city development will entail. The world of new cities is shifting all the time. There have been some major changes just in the last few weeks. Remember the ZEDE laws in Honduras? They don’t even exist any more! They were unanimously repealed by Honduras’ national congress. I’m still optimistic that some version of new cities will fit into the fabric of solutions to economic challenges. But I also recognize that, in 30 years, the actual model or models that succeed may look very different from many of the projects that have been proposed so far. In the meantime, knowing there are people like Mwiya out there, thoughtful enough to meaningfully consider the big questions facing their societies and daring enough to work on audacious solutions, gives me a lot of hope.

Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the first episode of this podcast you heard excerpts from my interview with Juan Du. She is the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto and the author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City. In our conversation she offers insights into Shenzhen’s history, explains the personal connection to the city that inspired her to spend 15 years writing a book about it, and reveals why she thinks the ‘Shenzhen Experiment,’ as she calls it, is far from over. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Dean Juan Du. Tamara Winter: So we’ll start with the hardest question first. Tell me your name, your academic affiliations, and why I’m talking to you right now. Juan Du: The why I’m not sure if I can tell you! So, hello, my name is Juan Du, I am the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto in Canada. And I recently relocated in the last six months from Hong Kong to Toronto. So it’s nice to be speaking with you. Tamara Winter: And tell me, so you’re an architect by trade. I would love if you could tell me a little bit about your background. How did you end up writing this book? Because, well you know certainly Shenzhen’s architecture is mentioned, that isn’t really the defining feature of the book. And maybe you could tell folks what the name of your book is as well. Juan Du: Sure. So the book is called The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City and the book as it was published is probably the fifth evolution of it or reincarnation of it. I didn’t start out by writing such a book because I am trained in architecture. And I started out to write a more architectural book about the city and specifically about the urban villages of the city. However, as I started to uncover more and more about the urban villages, I discovered a larger story really at the story of the city and the story of China. It is a story that I think is very misunderstood. It essentially is the story of China in the last 40 years and how that is contextualized within a broader understanding of the history of China, perhaps over a few centuries. So it just became a much bigger book, perhaps not in length, but in scope, the more I researched and worked on that. One of the first reasons why I wanted to write the book is actually based in my first hand experience of planning and design projects in Shenzhen. And I came across this deep history and vibrant, overlooked, urban neighborhoods that is not present in the way that Shenzhen is typically portrayed in either national media in China and especially international media in the world. It’s usually portrayed as the city without history, the city without any important pre-urbanization culture or people of significance. And that was just very much contrary to what my own experiences and later my own research uncovered. So this is why I decided to take on this challenge of writing this book. And it was very difficult for me, precisely because I wasn’t trained particularly to write such an expansive book, but it was very much a learning journey. And with these knowledge and lessons that I’ve uncovered over a decade of research and writing, I think it does contribute back to my own discipline of architecture and urban planning and design, but also I hope it contributes to others who are interested in economics, politics, geography, environmental transformation, whether it is in the Chinese context or anywhere else in the world. Tamara Winter: For anyone who isn’t familiar, what is Shenzhen? Where is it? And maybe you can answer this now, or I can ask it again in just a little bit, why is Shenzhen such a significant city? Juan Du: Sure. I’ll start with the ‘where’ first, maybe. So Shenzhen is located in southern China. It’s at the southern east most tip of China, just north of a river from Hong Kong. And the river is called the Shenzhen River. And this river is the border between the city of Shenzhen and the city of Hong Kong. And it used to also be an international border that you know defined between China and colonial era Hong Kong, which was ruled by the British. So it is a very interesting location. I would also say that what’s a unique geographical feature, in addition to where it’s located, is the people via one fact: it is the only city in China’s southern region where the primary dialogue is not Cantonese, which is the southern dialogue of China. The primary dialogue in Shenzhen is Mandarin, which is a typically northern dialogue that people have used to speak everywhere in China. So this is not to say that Shenzhen is a northern city, but it really testifies to the cosmopolitan nature of the city, that it is located in the southern tip. And it has a very rich southern history of China, but it is a city of migrants from all across China. And it’s really, I would say the most diverse city in China in terms of the backgrounds of people and where they’re from geographically and perhaps also socioeconomically. And I think that for me, is what makes it a significant city. And I would say that it also makes Shenzhen the most dynamic city in China today because of that mixture, because of that diversity. And it has this extreme mixture of low tech and high tech industries, it has this extreme mixture of urban and rural cultures. It has this extreme mixture of kind of the very local regional quality of a southern city with international enterprises and international headquarters via where it is and its unique history. It’s also significant if we want to speak about numbers, it’s also significant in terms of its population number. It is a city of 20 million people, which makes it a rare mega city in the world, 20 million. But what makes it more unique is that in the 1970s, the population in Shenzhen was 300,000. So it went from 300,000 to 10 million in two decades. And then when it was 10 million in the early 2000s, everyone said, “Well, this is it. This must be it. I mean, Shenzhen has reached this potential. It’s no longer unique. It’s no longer special.” Yet, over the following decade and two decades, it continued to grow into where it is today, a city, 20 million people. And that makes it an internationally significant city because that type of population growth, not only is it unprecedented in China, it’s unprecedented in the world, anywhere, at any moment of history, in the world. Tamara Winter: I really appreciate that because you just flagged Shenzhen’s population in the '70s. I’m going to come back and ask you a question about that because when I was working at the Charter Cities Institute, I was under the impression that the population was actually 30,000, but there’s a very particular reason why you used the 300,000 number. Juan Du: Yeah. Tamara Winter: But there were a lot of people who speak as though Shenzhen’s history began in 1979. Why was 1979 such a significant year for China more broadly? Juan Du: Right. So 1979 is a very significant year for both Shenzhen and China. In 1979 was the year, the city of Shenzhen was established, meaning it was formally designated as an urban unit. So prior to 1979, the region was called Bao’an county, which was a rural county in the province of Guangdong. So in 1979, it was designated on this special entity as a city of Shenzhen, but the further significance of 1979 to both Shenzhen and China is because 1979 was the year China, via the central government in Beijing, launched China’s reform and opening. It was basically the beginning of a series of economic and sociopolitical reforms that entirely pivoted China’s economy and culture onto the world stage and into the identity of what China is today, internationally. I think for anyone who perhaps do not have that particular memory or anyone who’s younger than 50, I would imagine that they would be very shocked if they’re shown images or facts about what China was like in the 1960s and '70s, including anyone who’s younger than 50 in China today. The year 1979 to launch, it was a very pivotal moment and pivotal year. It’s not to say everything was instant.1979 launched the reform and opening. 1979 established the city of Shenzhen, but the first decade of that was very rocky. It was very difficult. It was very challenging. Shenzhen was very close to being shut down multiple times, reform opening policies was close to shut down multiple times. It wasn’t until the mid 1990s, right, almost two decades after 1979, did it stabilize and the country and the city had enough confidence that this is definitely the right direction for the city and for the country. Tamara Winter: And for anybody who doesn’t already know, how did allowing Shenzhen, designating it as a special economic zone, change the city? I mean, you’ve alluded now to population growth. I’m also curious about GDP growth and more broadly how Shenzhen’s success really impacted the whole country. Juan Du: In 1979, what was initiated was not only the city of Shenzhen, there also was initiated a policy to create special economic zones. And in 1979, Shenzhen was one of four special economic zones that was created. So what makes Shenzhen’s beginning as a city unique is that within that year, it was both a city and a special economic zone in China. There are many conversations about special economic zones. It continued to be used almost like a miracle growth formula in the world today, especially in developing economies and cities, what it meant for China at that time for Shenzhen, at that time by special economic zone, it simply meant within the designated special economic zone of Shenzhen, which was only actually the southern half of the city of Shenzhen. But within that special economic zone that the zone and the city government had the power to create an experiment with various policies and various mechanisms that was not legal, that was not allowed and not existent outside of the zone. And I also think sociopolitical reforms and policies that were experimented with, that at the time was not possible anywhere else in China. For example, at that time, if you were not born in a particular city and had its local residency status, which is called Hukou in China, you cannot legally work in anywhere but that city. You cannot get a job, you cannot get housing, you cannot get married anywhere else, but that city. It was very much mechanism of economic and population management system in China, let’s say, that it was a planned economy. But because Shenzhen was designated as a special economic zone, in Shenzhen if you were a migrant from somewhere else, from another city, from a rural region, from a village, you could get a job. You could go to school, you could rent a home, you could get married, you could make so many decisions about your own life that at the time in China, you couldn’t. And that’s why it was significant. And I would say, that’s what attracted people to go there. So what makes it unique, it’s not only the number and the population growth. I think the question is that why did all these people go there? That’s one of the biggest, I think overlooked lessons. Shenzhen as is being discussed either as a charter city precedent or model, or as a special economic zone model. I think it’s important to keep in mind, is that what accounted for Shenzhen’s rapid population growth wasn’t necessarily just top down policy. It was a bottom up willingness that people wanted to go there. People were not forced to go there. People were not sent to go there. People left the comfort of their home. People left the comfort of their jobs and their families to go to, at the time, I said the first decade was very difficult for Shenzhen, but people left the comfort of their home. And under a planned economy, if you had a job, you had that job for life. It may not be a job you love, but you had it. You had housing, you had a job, you had your basic social networks. Within those first decade, the type of people that the city attracted were a very unique type of people. It was people who was more adventurous, it was people who is entrepreneurial. It was people who are not satisfied with what life offered them in wherever they were. So what makes Shenzhen a really interesting case study for me is a much more closer understanding of what propels people, what would attract someone to whichever place or whichever socioeconomic costs are coming from. What would attract someone to leave everything they know, and go to this place and believe that it is a land and opportunity. And to the testament of Shenzhen, even though there has been, of course, many people who arrived in Shenzhen and couldn’t make it and left, but many more did stay, right? The fact that it started with the population 300,000, now it’s 20 million. We’re basically talking about 20 million migrants, 20 million people, because it’s only within four decades, right? New population growth. Those were born in Shenzhen is still not the majority of the 20 million. The majority of the 20 million are migrants from everywhere else. They went to Shenzhen and they were able to, despite whatever challenges of a new environment, changing policy, they were able to take root and take advantage of the various unique opportunities that the city have offered and was able to make their homes there. Tamara Winter: You went to Shenzhen, I believe in 2005, I love that the book kind of starts and ends in the same place. Forgive me if I say this wrong, in Baishizhou, what did you see when you first got to Shenzhen and why is that specific village so significant to you? Juan Du: I did use Baishizhou, a particular urban village, as a historical site and device to open the book and end the book. And there are personal reasons. And I think for me also intellectual reasons to want to do that. Personal reasons is that in 2005, I was working in Beijing at the time and I was flying to Shenzhen to work. And I would fly to Shenzhen once every week or every two weeks. I’d fly in in the morning and I’d leave in the last flight out, because why would I want to stay in Shenzhen, it’s a city with no history, no culture. I’m only going there on business. And then one day my meeting ran over, the city official, the urban planner that I became very good friends with decades later was driving a bit too slow, going to the airport. And I missed my flight. So the city put me up in a hotel. It was a place called Overseas Chinese Town, O-C-T, which is the nicest neighborhood in Shenzhen. It has these kind of Italian villas. It has a very famous theme park. It has these tree-lined streets and some business hotels. So I was put there to stay for the night and take my first flight out the next morning. And in the hotel room, I couldn’t sleep. So I thought maybe a walk would do it. So I started walking and got lost and walked into this incredible scene, this was probably past midnight already, of a city square with everyone full of people at midnight, full of people, cooking and eating and this outdoor market, lots of kids running around. And I described it as seeing, I think in my book rather cinematically, but it was a very cinematic experience. It was as if I discovered this new world that no one had told me about, none of the architects and planners and government officials I had met at that time in Shenzhen, because I was just starting to understand the city has ever mentioned such a place of urban villages. None of what I’ve read about the city have talked about it. So it was just this incredible thing. And then later I was to understand that Baishizhou is the city’s largest and most populous urban village. It has this incredible history that I speak about in the book, I think in one of the chapters. And I did decide to end, I believe it was the last chapter on Baishizhou as well to, in some ways to talk about what started out as a very touristic understanding of what the urban village is and what the city is. But after a decade and a half of researching and interacting and learning from the local residents and the local scholars, I start to really have a much deeper understanding. However, by, at the end of the 15 years, Baishizhou was in the process of being cleared out for demolition. So I really wanted to be able to include that part in the book to really put in some ways a sense of urgency to what I wanted to call out to attention of both the people in Shenzhen, people in China, people everywhere else is that very often what’s happening through an urbanization process of so-called urban renewal, what we are demolishing, which on the surface might cosmetically look as if it shouldn’t be there, that in fact is the very heart and engine of what made that city vibrant and important in the first place. And that, for me, I think has a certain degree of urgency and has a degree of importance to be able to share with an international audience. Tamara Winter: Your book does, I think a masterful job of pointing out many misconceptions that people have about Shenzhen, whether it’s that Shenzhen’s success should primarily be attributed to top down government, to the idea that Shenzhen before the city kind of grew to become what we know it to be today, had no one there and it was just kind of this like back woods village and the land was pretty insignificant. So I’m wondering if you could tell me what are maybe some of the sort of most jarring misconceptions that people have about Shenzhen and why was it so important to you to kind of take pains to correct them? Juan Du: The reason why it’s important for me to put that front and center is because I had those very same misperceptions and misconceptions of the city when I started first going there. But what’s different between myself and perhaps the greater media perhaps is that my misconceptions are very quickly dispelled by me understanding the city more, but then is to watch that those misconceptions, not only did it stay throughout the decade and half I was researching and writing the book, they actually grew, it grew in their status. And it grew in the number of people who held them, it was primarily at first just kind of a national discussion. And then it became an international, Shenzhen became an international model city. And with Shenzhen’s reputation rising in the last decade, the misconceptions also arose in their importance and impact. So I thought it was really important to outline that and to say that this is why I’m writing the book, is I wanted people to have an understanding that not only is Shenzhen not the way that is commonly being perceived. In fact, it is the exact opposite. That’s what I think is really intriguing and unfortunate to me about these misconceptions of Shenzhen, and there’s many. But I think for the purpose for the book and for the purpose of me trying to create it more succinctly and communicate them, I had outlined that there was misconceptions of time, misconceptions of people, misconceptions of purpose. So misconceptions of time, we spoke about the fact that Shenzhen was established as a city in 1979. And for the most part, we’ve been speaking about the city’s growth in the past four decades and how that paralleled or instigates, actually, the growth of China in terms of economics in the past four decades. However, if you have read my book, you understand that in the book, I take pains to research and create evidence to show that the centuries of history prior to 1979 is as important as the history of the last four decades. And that if we did not understand what had happened in Shenzhen in the region in China prior to 1979, there could be no understanding of why Shenzhen was created. Why there was this special economic zone. Why China launched the reform opening. And most importantly, I think I wanted to evidence and I hope it was compelling to anyone who has read the book that the incredible urbanization and economic growth in Shenzhen in the past four decades absolutely was built up on foundations that was already preexistent in the region. And those foundations took decades, if not millennium, to be built. And that if Shenzhen was what people think it was in 1979, and this is where the misconception at place is also one of the misconception is that people think that in 1979, it was just a small sleeping fishing village of 30,000. First of all, there are no villages that has 30,000, especially a sleepy one and small one at that. But Shenzhen was not a small sleeping fishing village. Even if we don’t look at the population statistics, Shenzhen was a conglomerate of 2,000 villages and several historic townships that existed for centuries. And this is really important to understand the region and this particular place, the people, the geography, the fact that it was a port, the fact that it had these rivers, the fact that it had all of this land, that was cultivated. So that geographic understanding is really important because the misconception that Shenzhen grew from scratch, that it was a blank slate or tabula rasa is I think the most dangerous misconception that one can take zero, one can take a blank sheet of paper and that all you need to do is add money and policy that you can have a city. So I think that really is the biggest and most dangerous misconception of Shenzhen because that’s not how it happened. And the reason why I say it’s the most dangerous misconception is that Shenzhen now has been used as a model city in the context of charter cities, in the context of new cities, in the context of special economic zones, to demonstrate that not only is it possible to grow a city from blank, to plan a city from nothing. And all you had to do is add foreign direct investment. Not only is it not that, it’s the opposite of that. There was so much local indigenous knowledge and organizations and economies and local networks and international networks of those local indigenous villages that formed and actually allowed Shenzhen to survive its most difficult start up period at the first five years, the first 10 years. And this is really something that I’m very passionate about to advocate because I believe in the importance of cities, I even believe in charter cities as something that’s important to talk about, I believe that we can make new cities and make it livable and attractive, but we also need to understand that it’s not just add money or just add policy, there is no miracle growth in this way that it is city making. It’s a very, very complex and difficult process. And if my study of Shenzhen hopefully can evidence is that it’s really important to understand that preexisting geography of people, history, culture of that place and that we should see those existing geographies, not as something to get rid of, not as a inconvenience, not as a nuisance, but really see them as the key ingredient, the seeds, if you will, that can contribute to the success of the future new city or the future new charter city. Tamara Winter: I think a lesser understood part of Shenzhen’s kind of contribution to the world, its cultural contributions. There’s a music video that you reference. This is around the time that you’re starting to get the first music videos coming out of China and these music videos are being shot literally as the city is being constructed. And one thing you’ve taken quite a lot of care to sort of show, not tell people about, and whether it’s in your book or in your appearances since then, is the real spirit of the people in Shenzhen. Juan Du: Yeah. So, I think in the book, I say one evidence, the first master plan of Shenzhen was based on a anticipation of a population 1 million by 2010. And by all accounts, that was a very ambitious master plan. There are not many cities that was able to go from scratch to 1 million. It was already a very ambitious plan, top down planning, many cities who’s been planned to have city of 1 million do not have any, right. There are many ghost towns, whether in China or elsewhere, more top down planned cities fail than succeed. So the top down planning from policy, from resources, infrastructure, housing, central funding, what have you, anticipated population of 1 million by 2010. The actual population in 2010 in Shenzhen was 10 million, 10 times more than what was planned via policy and the various instruments of that, whether economic or spatial. So 90% was unanticipated bottom up, right? 90% was just, people wanted to go there. And this is where the importance of the urban village I was speaking about earlier because the city was planned with its infrastructure, whether it’s housing, schools, hospitals, restaurants, to serve a particular proportion of the population. Who made up for the 90%? The local communities, the local villages, they turned their own houses into rental housing. And then once they had rental housing, the new migrants opened up restaurants. So what’s interesting of Baishizhou is that you can walk into any street in Baishizhou, and you can, within one hour, sample food from all over China, because they’re all opened by migrants from all over China. So this is what I mean by that I think we have underestimated the powers of bottom up action and bottom up growth. And because the book is intended for a general intellectual audience, I do not put too much academic or theoretical terms in there, but that aligns with my own work, in understanding informal urbanization, informal settlements, and to understand how communities build their own housing, build their own economy, build their own social network and social systems. And I’ve come to really understand that for a city to be a healthy, vibrant, expanding city, you need both formal or top down policy and planning and governance. It’s not just, that’s not important. It’s very important without that 10%, right? Without that top down, there would’ve been no Shenzhen. But this other part, the informal growth, the informal settlements, kind of these informal networks that very much is tied into and contributed to that formal economy, that formal policy, you need that without the informal on the bottom up, there would be no Shenzhen as we understand it today, and we would not be speaking about it and I would not have written a book and it would not be cited in India and Africa, Honduras, Ireland, wherever it is around the world as a model city, right? Because that top down aspect, that kind of planning aspect is actually quite standard, but it’s this kind of how these policies, when emerged with the local population of the preexisting villages and were emerged with all of these people from all around the country, coming into this one city and all collectively believing in the possibility of the new. That is an incredible, I think, a social, psychological experiment. So, I go back to why I called my book The Shenzhen Experiment is because I think that it is very much an experimental city. It was set up as an experiment for China to experiment with, can you have market economy in a communist country? But I think its significance goes way beyond that. It’s an experimental city in understanding human nature. It’s an experimental city in understanding both the incredible opportunities of urbanization and rapid growth, but also the native impacts on the environment on the geography of rapid urbanization. You know, the fact that it’s the state of where it is today, of being say a mega city of between 10 million to 20 million people, it’s only in the last two decades. That makes it one of the world’s youngest cities and newest experiments. I think in the conclusion of my book, I said, “I think the Shenzhen experiment’s far from over.” So I am always very uncomfortable, even myself to make any very declarative or conclusive comments about Shenzhen, because I think we don’t really understand it yet. Despite the fact that I’ve spent these time researching into it and reading everything I can about Shenzhen and southern China, I think there’s still so many more we don’t know about the city. There’s so much more lessons to uncover. So I think this experiment continues and where the city is today and where it’s going to go, it’s an open question. It’s an absolute open question. So for me, is that there’s so much for us to learn about this city and for the knowledge and experience of the city to benefit both cities and governance and also individuals in China, in Asia, but also I think there’s a lot of lessons to offer to people from all around the world, whether they’re decision makers or they’re citizens themselves. In the book, I do highlight a number of individuals I have met. Some of them are historical figures, and some of them are common everyday people and how their own lives were impacted by the urbanization of the city. But also I wanted to show how they, as individuals contributed to the city and ultimately shaped the city. And one thing I always like to remind myself and remind everyone else, that 20 million sounds like a monolith block. It’s very common for when, especially in the American context, when we look at Chinese cities or when we look at China, we see these huge gigantic numbers and that just automatically turns apart your brain into thinking that is monolith. But I do want to highlight that it’s 20 million of individuals and it’s 20 million individuals not unlike you and I. It’s 20 million individuals who have their strengths and weaknesses, who have their own neuroses, who have their emotional baggage. And these individuals, whether they’re mayors or they’re construction workers, they have had and continue to have influences in shaping the city and that’s whether it’s in Shenzhen or elsewhere. And that ultimately is something that I really would like for, especially the English reading audience and especially the North American audience, to have a more humanistic understanding of Shenzhen, to have a more humanistic understanding of China, to have a more humanistic understanding of cities that in one country or in one city, there are so many diverse views and so many different diverse entities and that individuals, nationalities, places of residence should not be grouped in within one overarching understanding about one particular country. Imagine if that be the case in the reverse, right. Do we, as individuals, want to be defined by the overall message that came out of the U.S in the past five years? I would think not. So in the same way, I would also ask everyone to have the curiosity, to try to understand whether it’s China or India or Africa or France, to understand the nuances of these political situations, and to understand the difference between national politics and individual rights and individual dreams.

I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Tamara Winter: Earlier this year I visited California’s Salton Sea for the first time. I went with my friend and colleague Everett Katigbak. He’s a producer on this podcast, and you’ll hear from him throughout this episode. It was his first trip back in over 20 years. Everett Katigbak: It just surprised me how little has changed. But also seeing the lake itself was kind of surprising. When I was standing there the other day, it’s a no man’s land. It’s literally scenes out of Mad Max. I know we say that kind of jokingly, but you can really envision it. Tamara Winter: Since the waters of the Colorado River rushed into the Salton Basin in 1905, the lake they created has been a source of promise and conflict. Now it’s shrinking, and has become one of the most polluted bodies of water in the country. It’s also poised to become one of the largest sources of lithium in the United States. As the world transitions from gas to electric vehicles, demand for lithium is increasing rapidly. And so is interest in the Salton Sea. The potential for investment and industry could be transformational for the area. But what will that transformation look like? What impact will lithium extraction have on local communities? And what can examining the history of the Salton Sea reveal about its present and future? Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host Tamara Winter. In the first episode of Beneath the Surface we looked at charter cities. New urban developments built almost from scratch through financial investment and political will. In this episode we’re visiting a very different kind of place. Everett Katigbak: So we’re here in Salton City. This is, I think the largest community out here around the Salton Sea. Tamara Winter: The communities that have grown near the Salton Sea are unincorporated. And include everything from off-the-grid artist communities to half-inhabited suburban developments. The fate of these communities is tied to the sea. When it was a tourist destination they felt the benefits. But that opportunity has long since dried up, along with the sea. Now, the promise of becoming a ‘lithium valley’ is bringing a wave of development that could breathe new life into the area. I mentioned my colleague Everett. Well, when we started talking about doing an episode on the history and future of Salton Sea, we found out that Everett and his family have a stake in the area. At the tail end of the Salton Sea’s resort era, his family bought some land there. Hoping, like many, that it was an up-and-coming oasis. Everett Katigbak: This is the place where when I was young my parents actually bought a plot of land. We’re literally standing on this plot of land. Around it there’s a handful of homes, but for the most part it’s a bunch of empty lots out here. It is a very picturesque view. It’s like a postcard. But I imagine the closer you get to it the less photogenic it gets. Tamara Winter: You have a daughter Drew. How do you hope she experiences the Salton Sea? Do you think in her lifetime it might get, I don’t know, poppin’? Everett Katigbak: I don’t know…I don’t imagine she’ll have any connection to it. I never talked about it growing up. It’s just something I totally forgot about. The more my parents are getting older and thinking they need to let go of this place the more I’m hearing about the lithium stuff. So for me it’s something that I kind of want to hold onto for a little longer and see if something happens. Tamara Winter: In the early 20th century, major construction projects were underway across southern California. Engineers planned irrigation canal networks to bring water to arid corners of the California desert. The dream at the time was to provide water for farming to the scorching hot Imperial Valley where temperatures regularly spike well above 100 degrees. Rain rarely falls. And snow has been recorded only once in the last century. But nature had other plans. For millennia, the Colorado River had occasionally made its way into the Salton Basin, creating lakes. But in the spring and summer of 1905 multiple floods wore down and eventually broke through the canal gates. And water poured into the basin. Initial attempts to close off the flow of water failed miserably. Another flood in November swept away the hastily constructed dams of gravel and brush. For two years the water flowed. And for two years crews worked around the clock. In sweltering temperatures. Under the threat of multi million-gallon flash floods. To redirect the river. When the water was finally stopped, the newly formed Salton Sea covered over 400 square miles. The early years of the Sea were mostly quiet. Naturalists categorized the many species of birds that began to congregate on its shores. The Salton Sea Wildlife Refuge was created. During the Second World War the sea became a source for fish when German u-boats made the ocean too dangerous. The military used the sea for bombing exercises. In fact, the crew that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima flew practice missions over the Salton Sea. The sea, however, was already shrinking and becoming saltier and saltier. But this didn’t stop interest in the sea from growing during the postwar economic boom. One of the people who moved to the Salton Sea after World War II was Helen Burns. She and her family made their home on a small plot of land owned by her father. Her daughter Donna Kennedy—who was barely more than a toddler at the time—remembers those early years well. Donna Kennedy: She moved us down to the Salton Sea into a trailer which had an adjacent outhouse. And we had a standpipe where we could stand and bathe. It didn’t make any difference that we were nude because no one else was there, it was completely deserted, just us. Tamara Winter: Living in the semi-wild meant Donna and her sister had a unique childhood. Donna Kennedy: We did a lot of swimming in the sea, it was very clean then. Sandy beach and very lovely. So my sister and I would just frolic in the water and the sagebrush and try to catch lizards and avoid snakes and scorpions too, we didn’t care for scorpions. Tamara Winter: Helen, however, had big dreams. She set up a makeshift stand built out of a piano box and some palm fronds. Truck drivers. Immigrants trekking up from Mexico. Occasional tourists. They all stopped by Helen’s for soda, coffee, postcards, or tubes of Salton Sea sand. Business grew. And so did the number of tourists. The Salton Sea became a destination, marketed as an inland resort—the next Palm Springs. By the 1950s the Salton Sea was the place to be. And Helen expanded to meet the demand. Donna Kennedy: Basically if you wanted to have some fun you went to Helen’s. At her high point she had a marina, a boat dock, gas tanks. A campground. Besides the bar and restaurant, the motel, but I’d say by 1958 things were really moving. On 4th of July she had hell divers and people water skied across the sea and back and got trophies and wore little horns. On New Years she had icebreakers and people skied across and back. There was the Miss Salton Sea Contest, the Mr. Salton Sea Contest. There were treasure trails where people went across the desert in their dune buggies and they’d try to find all the treasures she had hidden…it was just roaring with activity. Tamara Winter: Helen even earned a new title: Queen of the Salton Sea.Helen wasn’t the only one who saw the promise of the sea in the 50s and 60s. Other entrepreneurs, sensing opportunity, hitched their fortunes to the sea. The newly formed Salton City grew and grew. Promotional videos from the time show a desert oasis, a paradise of crystalline waters and inviting beaches. The future for Salton Sea couldn’t have looked brighter. Archived audio: In an article appearing in the The Los Angeles Times April 17th, 1966, Salton City was chosen by a group of planners, architects, administrative officers, politicians, professors, and associated thinkers as one of the 24 major cities in southern California in the year 2000. Tamara Winter: By the late 1960s and early 1970s however, tourism was drying up. And so was the sea. The water level dropped so significantly and the salt level rose so much, environmental observers worried that the fish and birds that lived in and around the sea would begin to die. The lack of rainfall in the Imperial Valley meant that the sea’s main source of new water was agricultural runoff. Which brought with it pesticides. Soon birds began dying and algae bloomed in the once clear waters. Resorts closed or scraped by with reduced clientele. When powerful tropical storms ripped through the Imperial Valley in the mid-70s many packed up for good. Archived audio: Whacko: It used to be a real nice dinner house owned by Bill and Maxine McClaren. Huell Howser: What happened to it? Whacko: Eh, the floods. Huell Howser: Uh huh. Whacko: They kinda split up, well, actually it’s the floods what did it. Tamara Winter: By 2000, Salton City was far from being one of southern California’s major cities as the LA Times had predicted. In fact, its population shrank to less than 1,000. Most people who have heard of the Salton Sea are probably familiar with this era of its life - from the 70s to the present. In the popular imagination, it has existed for almost 50 years as a polluted, decaying, steadily salinating space populated either by die-hards left over from its boom years, or those looking for off-the-grid living in the surrounding desert. Less than an hour south of the sea, the unincorporated community of Slab City grew on the remains of a defunct military base. Artists, dropouts, and others seeking a life outside of mainstream society congregated in the desert in what is now affectionately referred to as “The Last Free Place in America.” When we visited Salton Sea, Everett made a trip out to The Slab and talked to some of the colorful residents. Wizard: Greetings and welcome to East Jesus! I am your mediocre half-assed tour guide. I don’t give tours. Tamara Winter: That’s Wizard. Wizard: I spend six months here and six months in India or Vietnam. Tamara Winter: If you meet him, his name makes a lot of sense. He’s got this long dusty gray beard that he’s clearly been growing for several decades and he speaks with the confidence of someone who could conjure a rabbit out of a hat. Wizard: This is a sheltered workshop for the work ethic impaired. They’re not lazy. They’re work ethic impaired. Tamara Winter: East Jesus is a massive collaborative art piece. Wizard: It’s a work of over 2,000 artists. And they would come here and they’d be inspired by the art. They would create art. Tamara Winter: It’s about 50 miles from where Everett’s family has their plot of land in Salton City. On the other side of the sea. But the environmental disaster at the sea touches both communities. As the sea evaporates in the baking desert sun, dust rises from the exposed lakebed. Wizard: The wind blows all this toxicity towards San Diego and LA and Imperial County doesn’t have the money to do anything but San Diego and LA does. If it affects them, they’ll do something about it. Archived audio: Sort of fine white powdery dust sits on top of the playa…and a very small wind will blow that and…I’ve been out here at times when it looked like a snow blizzard, you couldn’t see anything. Tamara Winter: Faced with looming environmental and human crises, the state of California has created commissions. Convened taskforces. And made multimillion—even multibillion—dollar promises to restore the sea. But these plans, some of which have been debated for almost two decades, have not changed the day-to-day reality for many who live in the area. Now the Salton Sea is at a crossroads. It is a potentially vast source of lithium - an essential ingredient in the batteries that power the green economy. Audrey Carleton: Lithium, it’s been called “white gold” it’s kind of this like crucial element in the move towards electric vehicles and the move away from oil and gas. Tamara Winter: That’s Audrey Carleton. Audrey Carleton: I am an environmental journalist for Vice. I wrote this story on the Salton Sea becoming sort of this new quote-un-quote “lithium valley” through this deal that General Motors has with Controlled Thermal Resources. Tamara Winter: Leading car companies are increasing the number of electric vehicles they can produce. Tesla made headlines last fall for having a market valuation greater than Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, Ford, and GM combined. But GM’s stated transformative goals set them apart. Audrey Carleton: General Motors is kind of paving the way. So, they made a first in the nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. Archived audio: Person 1: General Motors plans to stop making gas powered cars by 2035… Person 2: On the assembly line at this GM plant outside Detroit there are two things autoworkers…will never see again internal combustion engines, and gas tanks. Audrey Carleton: Because they are like the American automaker and they’ve made this kind of first commitment to be all EV by that period of time they are really kind of setting a standard for other automakers. Tamara Winter: Right now it’s estimated that almost 30% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United states come from transportation. So it’s understandable why GM’s plans are so ambitious. And their dedication to lithium mining is so strong. Audrey Carleton: They’re really sort of trying to carve themselves out as a leader in the EV space in doing so and in order to make that happen they’re going to need a lot of lithium so General Motors struck up a deal with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to mine for lithium for lithium ion batteries to go in electric vehicles. Tamara Winter: Enter the Salton Sea. The US Department of Energy estimates that the sea could be the source of up to 600,000 tons of lithium. Per year. In fact, the Salton Sea is… Michael McKibben: …the largest brine source of lithium in the world. Tamara Winter: That’s Dr. Michael McKibben. He’s an Emeritus Professor of Geology at the University of California Riverside. He’s also one of the authors of a recent report on energy resources—including lithium—at the Salton Sea. To understand how lithium will be extracted at Salton Sea, we first need to talk about why it’s there in the first place. That’s a journey that starts millions of years ago, and thousands of miles away. The Colorado River snakes and curves across the southwestern United States passing through parts of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and finally California. The waters of the river have traveled that route for millions of years slowly eating away at sandstone and sediment. It was these waters that carved out the Grand Canyon. Over millennia the river carried all of the rock and mineral it eroded away. Occasionally, when hard rains fell, or there was heavy snowmelt in the Rockies, the river waters rose. And in southern California, the river would burst its banks and the parched Imperial Valley would be filled. Temporarily. The ancient lakes that formed became central to the lives and mythologies of the native peoples who lived in the area. Quechans, Chemehuevis, Cahuillas, and Kumeyaays gathered on the lake’s shores and fished their waters. The presence of these lakes can still be seen. The largest and most recent, called Lake Cahuilla, left what are called ‘bathtub rings’, or marks on the surrounding rockfaces indicating where its waters once stopped. Repeated flooding and evaporation over thousands of years left behind sediment full of minerals and trace metals, picked up as the river rushed from the Rockies to the sea. Among those metals: lithium. A lot of lithium. Dr. Michael McKibben explains just how much. Michael McKibben: Sort of back of the envelope calculation estimates I’ve done are somewhere on the order of two million to six million metric tons of lithium. Tamara Winter: A million, or six million, of anything is a lot, but Dr. McKibben puts those numbers into perspective. Michael McKibben: You know, even if we just produce a faction of it every year we could supply all US needs for lithium and actually have enough left over to export it to other countries. That would totally reverse the situation the U.S. is in where we’re now importing over 95% of the lithium we need. Tamara Winter: Right now, most lithium is mined outside the United States. Australia, Chile, Argentina, and China are all home to robust mining operations. But it’s not just the fact that the Salton Sea is in the United States that makes it such an attractive source of lithium. It’s the way lithium can be extracted. Right now, there are two common ways lithium is mined: open-pit, and evaporation. Open-pit mining is especially common in Australia. Archived audio: It’s vast and remote here in Pilbara and rich in minerals. Tamara Winter: Pilbara: sparsely populated and full of lithium. It’s home to growing mining operations. Archived audio: A new mine has recently opened here with the aim of becoming one of the biggest lithium mines in the world. Tamara Winter: That clip is from 2018. Since then, global demand for lithium has grown. And mining operations have become more and more lucrative. Archived audio: But we do things differently here. Mining hard rock lithium. Tamara Winter: In this type of mining, lithium-rich rocks are blasted apart. Pulverized. And soaked in sulphuric acid. Places like Pilbara are the ideal location for this kind of mining. It’s a region slightly larger than Iraq, but with barely more than 60,000 residents. But the pits still leave deep scars across the land. And acid runoff contaminates water supplies. The other type of mining used to collect lithium is evaporation mining. This practice is most common in South America and involves pumping groundwater from underneath dry lake beds and salt flats into enormous evaporation ponds. For example, the ponds at the Atacama salt flat form a checkerboard that stretches almost 30 square miles. In addition to taking up a lot of land, this type of mining uses large quantities of water in areas where it is already scarce. Indigenous communities near the Atacama salt flats have lost access to water and those opposed to mining fear for the fate of local wildlife if the mining operation continues. Archived audio: Sonya Ramos believes that lithium mining is killing this desert. A growing number of Chilean scientists agree and have come to the Atacama to join her campaign to stop it. Tamara Winter: So, the irony here is clear. Mining lithium—the metal that is crucial to a global transition to clean energy, can create environmental issues of its own. Added to this is another uncomfortable reality: currently the most developed nations in the world have the highest demand for lithium. But it’s sourced from some of the poorest. As Dr. Michael McKibben notes… Michael McKibben: We’re letting all the environmental problems occur in these other countries to satisfy our need for lithium. Tamara Winter: But this is where the Salton Sea comes in. The way that lithium will be gathered from the Imperial Valley is so different from open-pit and evaporation mining that Dr. McKibben hesitates to call it mining at all. Michael McKibben: The thing I worry about most is people understanding direct lithium extraction in the context of how lithium is mined elsewhere in the world. And that’s really our biggest challenge is we shouldn’t call it lithium mining at the Salton Sea—we should call it lithium extraction because it’s not mining in the traditional sense of the word. Tamara Winter: The process called direct lithium extraction involves using some of the green energy infrastructure already at the Salton Sea and repurposing it to collect lithium in addition to creating clean energy. There are already large scale geothermal energy projects at the Salton Sea. Everett and I saw some of them when we visited. Everett Katigbak: Maybe describe we’re seeing, Tammy. Tamara Winter: Okay, well this is a geothermal plant. It’s interesting…everything looks rusted by the way…it’s a lot larger than I thought when we were first driving in. You’ve got these giant, round cylinders with scaffolding at the top I guess. Tamara Winter: They draw hot saline brine, rich in metals and minerals, to the surface. As the brine is brought up, the change in pressure causes it to boil. The steam from the brine turns turbines creating electricity. Usually the brine and the recondensed steam are pumped back into the ground so the process can begin again. Direct lithium extraction basically places a filter on this process. Using other elements to draw the lithium out of the brine after it has already been brought to the surface. Then the brine, minus some lithium, is pumped back into the ground. Geothermal electricity is created. Lithium is extracted. And the only remnants are the brine and water. The potential for geothermal energy and lithium extraction at Salton Sea is especially promising because of California’s green energy goals. Michael McKibben: So California is now legislatively mandated to have its electrical grid be based on all renewables by 2045. And so that means we need more geothermal energy to satisfy that requirement and we need more lithium storage batteries to store electricity. Tamara Winter: This new commitment to renewables means that California is ready to invest in more geothermal energy. The state—famously situated on a fault line—has huge geothermal potential. But geothermal has long played third fiddle to wind and solar because of the high cost of building power plants. Now, as California works to decarbonize, the growth in demand for geothermal energy could provide an influx of well-paying jobs and political attention to the Imperial Valley. Michael McKibben: The state public utilities commission just asked for 1000 megawatts more of geothermal energy and the only place that can be supplied by really is the Salton Sea geothermal field. So they may have to double or triple the number of geothermal powerplants down there over the next decade to satisfy the demand for renewable energy. Tamara Winter: This could be an avenue to even more green industry. More geothermal plants means more potential for lithium extraction. But extraction is only the first step. Currently almost 80% of lithium ion batteries are made in China. If lithium extraction at the Salton Sea is successful, it is entirely possible that the area will become the ideal location for large scale domestic battery production. All of this potential is politically attractive. Presidents from both parties have championed the idea of “energy independence” for decades. Archived audio: Gerald Ford: Good evening. Last January 15th I went before your senators and representatives in congress with a comprehensive plan to make our country independent of foreign sources of energy by 1985… Archived audio: Ronald Reagan: ...technologies and more independence from foreign oil. Archived audio: George H. W. Bush: ...there is no security for the United States in further dependence on foreign oil. [Cheering] Archived audio Bill Clinton: I have repeatedly called in this campaign for more energy independence for America… Archived audio: George W. Bush: One of the greatest results of using hydrogen power of course will be energy independence for this nation. Archived audio: Barack Obama: We are closer to energy independence than we’ve ever been before… Archived audio: Donald Trump: We have energy independence right now… Archived audio: Joe Biden: …quote “energy independent” which is a phrase that’s thrown around… Tamara Winter: Energy independence. A political catch phrase that is so popular because it can mean, well, almost anything. Does it mean opening up protected lands for oil drilling? Expanding fracking operations? Investing in wind power and solar arrays? Well, depending on who is speaking it could be any of those. Or all of them. But the underlying desire for stable, domestic sources of energy makes a lot of sense. And as the globe transitions to green energy, the benefits of significant domestic production of lithium and lithium batteries will only grow. The question remains: will lithium extraction do what no other industry has accomplished and bring political attention and well-paying jobs to the Imperial Valley? Archived audio: Infrastructure turned this desert into productive farmland, but young people…worry that there’s no political will to help this delicate ecosystem and the families who live here. Tamara Winter: For decades the communities near the Salton Sea have heard government promises of investment. And while there is a lot of hope about what lithium extraction could mean, there is also some understandable suspicion. Archived audio: Person 1: Anecdotally after windy days we see a lot more asthma patients coming in. Person 2: Myself and my family developed asthma while living here. Tamara Winter: Childhood asthma rates are more than twice as high in the area around the Salton Sea than in the rest of California. As the sea continues to shrink… Archived audio: This area used to be water…but now obviously it’s dry here and the shoreline is hundreds of yards in this direction. Tamara Winter: …more and more fine dust particles are exposed. And risk rises. The hope is that, through lithium extraction, not only will the area receive an economic boost, but that efforts to restore the area will also gain attention and urgency. Roy Durantes: For a very long time the state was the number one entity working to restore the Salton Sea and to be honest with you things were going very slow. Tamara Winter: Roy Durantes is a former news producer and the founder of a group called “Saving the Salton Sea.” He’s also the director of the Salton Sea Film Festival, which gives local youth the opportunity to document their experiences of the area. Roy Durantes: I am not an expert. I am just a concerned resident. I know some people who suffer asthma. And one of my very close friends had some asthma seizures. The playa dries, all these contaminants that have been dormant there for practically 100 years could dry up and become airborne could become dust and go into the region and into people’s lungs. Tamara Winter: Durantes worries that the speed of the state’s response does not match the rate at which the environmental disaster is escalating. Roy Durantes: If you look at the playa exposure. This thing, man, is drying. It’s almost like in a race to dry up and we’re in a race to stop it from drying up because we don’t want to turn this into a ghost town. Tamara Winter: But there are still open questions around what lithium extraction will mean for the Imperial Valley. One thing is certain: lithium operations will grow in coming years. Global demand is expected to rise by over 800% in the next decade. So as this new layer of energy infrastructure is being created, it’s important to ask the right questions. At the Salton Sea, an area that has seen economic and political promise come and go, all these questions are playing out in real time. As Dr. McKibben explains… Michael McKibben: So part of the challenge to the geothermal companies and then those of us who are doing research down there is to educate the public about what’s going on and to help them understand that this is not traditional lithium mining that we’re talking about. Tamara Winter: A little bit like the L.A. Times in 1966 envisioning the area as the next Palm Springs, there is a potentially thrilling future in the making at the Salton Sea. One where lithium extraction is a success, battery factories are built, well-paying jobs flood the Imperial Valley like the Colorado River waters, and the environmental crisis at the Sea is contained. That’s a future Roy Durantes can see. Roy Durantes: What’s important is the thousands of families who are here. The thousands of kids, the thousands of people. My hope for the area is that the Salton Sea is restored so that it becomes a place of business. A place of industry. A place of recreation. A place of economy. A lot of us are very expectant and very hopeful. We want to see something happen. We want people to bring in solutions. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee and we had editing support from Astrid Landon. Original music for this episode was composed by Auribus. To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, our films, and more, visit press.stripe.com That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the second episode of this podcast you heard excerpts from my interview with Audrey Carleton. She is an environmental journalist and multimedia producer who writes for Motherboard, the science and technology arm of VICE. She covers all aspects of the global transition to green energy. In our conversation she discusses the potential for lithium extraction at the Salton Sea. She also draws on her experience covering the oil and natural gas industries to help explain why local environmental and social justice groups have reservations about the lithium operations. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Audrey Carleton. Tamara Winter: So Audrey, why are we talking today? Audrey Carleton: So we’re talking today because a couple of months ago, General Motors, which is America’s car maker, basically, struck up a deal with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to mine for lithium for lithium ion batteries to go in electric vehicles. For context GM made this first-in-the-nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. And you know, they’re really sort of trying to carve themselves out as a leader in the, in the EV space in doing so. And in order to make that happen, they’re gonna need a lot of lithium. So they have staked out this area with Controlled Thermal Resources in Southern California called the Salton Sea which is a really interesting place because it’s this very toxic, very salty lake. It’s, it’s just a interesting place. And there’s a lot of kind of sociopolitical dynamics going on here, but essentially the goal is to mine for lithium using existing geothermal power plants and use that lithium to create EV batteries and achieve this goal of, you know, being all electric by 2035. Tamara Winter: So you recently wrote about Salton Sea. Tell me a little bit about that. Audrey Carleton: So back in July, I wrote this story for Motherboard on the Salton Sea becoming sort of this new quote unquote “lithium valley” through this deal that General Motors has with Controlled Thermal Resources. Tamara Winter: So Audrey, what is the Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: So the Salton Sea is not actually a sea. It is sort of a lake. And it’s kind of an accidental one. It was created in 1905 as kind of like an offshoot of the Colorado River. So essentially the Colorado River spilled out of its irrigation system into this one kind of reservoir in the very southern tip of California near Baja. It’s also kind of near Joshua Tree, if you’re familiar with that area. It sits around 200 feet below sea level. And it doesn’t have an outlet. So there’s, you know, water kind of flows into it from the Colorado River, but it doesn’t flow out of it. So it just kind of sits there and the way that the water level is managed is water kind of evaporates off of it. And that process leaves behind a lot of salt and a lot of minerals. So it’s become, over the years, incredibly salty, I think somewhere around 50% saltier than the Pacific Ocean. So it’s not the most habitable place for animals or people. It’s in the middle of the desert, but you know, it’s, it’s a really kind of interesting, interesting area from a social kind of demographic standpoint. I believe the last numbers I saw on unemployment in the region were around 20%. So pretty high. So, you know, I think we could call this in, in one future day, if, if this does become a real lithium hub I think it will be a place where environmental justice questions are like really at the forefront of who’s involved in the economic boon that this creates, who kind of benefits from it and who is potentially harmed. I think there are a ton, a ton of interesting questions, all kind of hovering around this area. And after I published this story for VICe, I will admit, this is probably the one story that has gotten me the most, the most response, because this is like an extremely hot button controversial issue. Tamara Winter: I want to get back to some of that after we set some context for folks who may not be familiar with things like what lithium even is and why Salton Sea is, is so toxic. So Audrey, what is lithium? Audrey Carleton: Sure. Great question. It is an element, you might remember it from the periodic table and it is a key ingredient in lithium ion batteries. So specifically, it’s extremely conductive. What that means is it has an extra electron on its outer shell and that electron because it just has the one it wants to be moving around and glamming onto other elements and creating bonds and in bouncing around so much, it creates an electrical current. So it’s highly conductive and when it’s shoved into batteries, it makes, you know, a really strong electrical current. It’s also unbelievably flammable. So these lithium battery fires are kind of a growing issue that we’ve also been working on at VICE. It’s, it’s because it’s so conductive, it’s really hard to put out and fires kind of spread in this crazy way because this one electron just wants to glam onto other things and they can be really hard to control. That’s a little bit tangential, but you know, lithium is, it’s been called white gold. It’s kind of this like crucial element in the move towards electric vehicles and the move away from oil and gas because we need batteries in order to create electric vehicles and to create battery storage. Batteries will be the key to holding onto the energy that’s generated from wind and solar. In, you know, in kind of building up that infrastructure. It’s super important. I mean, one of the main kind of counterpoints that people always say about wind and solar is, well not everywhere is windy and the sun is only out for half the day, less than that during wintertime. So how are we going to, you know, generate constant energy storage or have sort of a constant, reliable energy source if these things are not around for, if they’re only around for a short amount of time and the answer is, is batteries you generate electrical current and you store it into a battery and then that’s, you know, used for later, but we need to be creating batteries and mining for minerals or elements like lithium in order to do that. And, you know, lithium’s a crucial one and it’s got a, gotten a lot of attention, but there are other elements that have kind of been that are like essential to battery creation too. Like cobalt. But it’s sort of the big one. Tamara Winter: How is lithium mined typically? Audrey Carleton: Sure. Yeah. So Lithium’s kind of an interesting element. It doesn’t exist in a pure state in the earth. That’s usually glommed on with you know, another element. So it’s often mined in this process called open-pit mining, and thisrefers to the kind of technique for mining. And that’s used also in like coal mining and mining for lots of other things, but specifically with lithium, essentially what happens is a few feet of earth is dredged up. Usually open-pit is used and with open-pit mining, this is usually done with whatever the mineral or element that is being mined is pretty close to the surface of the earth. So you just kind of just dig up some earth. A few feet, few hundred feet. And create an open space, and that will make way for the minerals that you’re looking for. This process is done with coal mining for example, this is the same process that leads to mountaintop removal which is extremely controversial and really environmentally destructive. But with lithium mining, it’s, you don’t quite have to go that deep, it often creates these sort of flats. They kinda look like salt flats. You may have seen, you know, like these aerial images of lithium mines, they’re these kind of vast greenish whiteish kind of, honestly like really beautiful looking mines. And what happens is when that earth is dredged up, it gives way for this sort of salty, muddy briney stuff that then the water is evaporated off of it. And that leaves just the minerals behind. And then those are distilled and lithium is taken from it. And this is done typically, I mean, there’s, this is sort of a new thing for the U.S., but there’s this one region in South America called the lithium triangle in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. And there’s these massive lithium mines there. And that’s sort of the process there is open-pit mining and the one consequence to this, the few consequences to this is that it’s very water intensive, it creates a fair amount of mineral waste. And, you know, the health consequences of being around open-pit mines are sort of unknown. There’s this one lithium mine in Nevada, in this region called Thacker Pass that’s gotten a lot of attention and been very, very controversial because it would sort of require doing this same process and dredging into this one mountain. And you know, I think a lot of concern around this process is valid because we just, you know, it’s relatively new, we just don’t know a ton about it. So we, it’s sort of, it’s sort of like a new frontier, like a new unknown, what, what it’s gonna, you know, what kind of consequences it’s gonna hold for the people who work in this industry and the people who live nearby it. Tamara Winter: And I am gonna jump out of order here, but I’m curious how CTR’s process differs from open-pit mining. Audrey Carleton: Yeah, sure. So, Controlled Thermal Resources has proposed a slightly different process from the typical sort of open-pit mining process. The Salton Sea is already home to a number of geothermal plants so those are power plants that take heat and steam from deep beneath the earth. It’s kind of the same heat and steam that you might see in a geyser, and it’s a renewable resource. I mean, we will always have these stores of heat underneath the earth. And you know, these geothermal mines take this up and generate energy from it and then pump that back into the earth. So it’s renewable. What CTR has proposed is taking brine as a byproduct of these power plants and extracting lithium from it, and then sending that same water back into the earth. So it’s essentially taking a byproduct of an existing energy generation process and taking a mineral out of it and then returning what was already going to be going back underground into the earth. The company has been firm that this process is less water intensive and less wasteful. And generally just kind of better for the environment than open-pit mining and requires a lot less in terms of land use. Because that’s another thing with mining is that it uses a ton of land and you know, like maybe years down the line, we’re seeing this with coal mines, at least in the infrastructure package, there’s sort of a push to reforest old coal mines and that’s possible, but it takes a lot of work. And so that’s one, one other consequence of, of traditional mining is just how much it takes in terms of land. And you know, that is land that takes a lot of work to get it back to the way that it was or if you even can get it back to the way that it was. So, you know, this process kind of takes advantage of existing infrastructure. But that said, I mean, they’re still working out the kinks of what exactly this is gonna look like and, and what they need to build and what they need to create in order for, you know, this, this lithium valley or this, they calling it ‘hell’s kitchen’. This region of California to become a real lithium mining area. They’re still kind of working out what that’s gonna look like in terms of infrastructure. So the land use question is kind of still, it’s still there. Tamara Winter: And I know you touched on this a little bit earlier, but I’m going to ask it again. What companies right now are really interested in mining lithium in Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: So General Motors is kind of the big one that’s staking its claim in this region, but California has created a commission, the Lithium Valley Commission, to kind of oversee the process and turn this area into the home of an industry. I think of it as like a second Silicon Valley, because the names are so similar, but General Motors is kind of paving the way. So they made a first-in-the-nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. And you know, because they’re like the American automaker and you know, they’ve made this, this kind of first commitment to be all EV by that period of time, they are really kind of setting a standard for other automakers. It’s going to say, if this works, it’s going to say to other automakers, look, we can do this, here’s how you can do it as well, we can live in an electric vehicle country, you know, within, within a reasonable amount of time. And it could turn this area into a real hotbed. It could really make this part of California, like an actual lithium valley, you know? So I think it’ll be interesting to see what happens. But we’re still a couple years away from that because the deal, you know, with this one mine is still kind of being figured out. Tamara Winter: Why is it so important to mine more and more lithium? Why is there particularly such interest right now? Audrey Carleton: Yeah. That’s a great question. So lithium is a crucial element in the creation of batteries. And batteries are going to be essential in the transition away from fossil fuels because they hold on to energy that can be, you know, kind of created at any time and they make broadly speaking, they make renewable resources more reliable and more sustainable. Wind and solar are often kind of critiqued as being unreliable resources because the sun only shines for a certain amount of time every day and the wind is not everywhere, not all parts of the world are windy, and the wind doesn’t blow all the time. It doesn’t blow at the same speed. So how can we rely on these resources? Well, the answer is with batteries. By taking that energy and storing it somewhere, we have it to use for later during periods when it’s nighttime or periods, when it’s, there’s not as much of wind as a resource, we have that energy that we can rely on. With electric vehicles specifically, what that means is that each car has a battery and that gets plugged into a charger, but the energy that that charger pulls from the grid can come from any number of resources. So it’s kind of a mix right now. It could come from oil and gas. It could come from renewables, but the goal is to transition the entire energy grid to renewables and be able to pull energy from that and store it in cars with batteries. Batteries are essential for everything for the broader kind of transition to renewables. They’re essential for cars because they eliminate the likelihood that you’re using fossil fuels to power your car, because the energy that you’re pulling and storing in that battery could come from any number of things. As long as it’s energy, it can be stored in a battery, essentially. It’s just electrical current. Tamara Winter: Are there environmental risks to lithium mining? Audrey Carleton: I mean the main things are the land questions, the land use questions and also the water that’s required. And the waste. So those are the three big ones is that it’s this process that just requires a lot of water to generate, you know, to pull minerals out of these briney kind of flats. And it, you know, requires a ton of land. A lot of land has to be staked out to create these mines. And in, you know, like Thacker Pass that’s land that’s on the top of a mountain. It’s also land that is on and near Indigenous communities. So that’s very, you know, valuable, culturally valuable and really, really important land. It’s the water, it’s the land and it’s the waste. There’s a lot of mineral waste that’s generated in this process as well. So, you know, CTR, Controlled Thermal Resources aims to kind of cut those out of the process by just using a byproduct of existing infrastructure. But it’s also kind of a new technology that they have created. Tamara Winter: And who lives in and around Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: The community around the Salton Sea is fairly low income. Historically on average, there are a lot of Latino communities in that region. And this would be, if this goes well, and the jobs were given to people in this community, it would be a real boon. I think from what I gauged when I was reporting on this story there is a fair amount of distrust because there were some solar projects that went up in the region a few years ago that did not end up having the jobs go to the community. That’s sort of historically how these things go. I mean, solar’s a little bit different and renewables we’re still kind of learning, but with oil and gas projects, often what happens is, you know, a pipeline will go up or oil wells will go up, or drill rigs. And the people who work on those rigs are often not people from the community. They are people who work for the company and travel around and go from region to region. And so that’s how you sort of hear about these like abandoned or these sort of ghost oil towns in, you know, in the Permian Basin in Texas is, the industry will kind of move into a region. It will be a huge boon that helps all sectors of life. I mean, the value of everything goes up when there’s a resource like this that’s so valuable and, and becomes such a part of the economy. Everything from like haircuts to like how much your coffee costs, everybody’s just making more money for that short amount of time. But then once that resource dries up, those workers move away, they go onto a new place. That’s also how you hear about these, these sort of man camps of workers who kind of move into this region and work for a period of time and then move to the next one with their company. That’s sort of the trajectory that we’ve seen with fossil fuels. I think there’s still a lot that we’re seeing around the construction of all renewable infrastructure, including mines for elements like lithium. But I think the number one concern that anybody has when something like this pops up in their region is who’s going to be benefiting from it. And if this doesn’t become something that could lift up the community around the Salton Sea and flow cash into it and really become an economic boon for that region and the people that have lived there for decades then it’s kind of like, who’s it for? What are the consequences, what are the trade offs, what’s being sacrificed in order to make this happen? And, you know, if this mining typically is not great, I mean, mining is like kind of a dangerous, dangerous process. Coal mining we have seen comes with like countless health consequences and lithium mining is still kind of being studied, but you know, if there are harms and those harms are kind of inflicted on the people who live in that region, but at the same time, they’re not really given, you know, the local jobs then that’s like a really unfortunate trade off. That’s a really, really unfortunate situation. And it would be kind of an injustice for that to happen. Fortunately, it’s looking like that’s not going to be the process, but I think that is the fear. And so, you know, the folks that I talked to when I was reporting this story out said that people in the community hadn’t really been informed of the mines going up, but were open to being part of that. If it was something that was, that proved to be kind of a financial boon for the region. But you know, they just kind of want to have a stake in the process. And that’s why this Lithium Valley Commission is so important. It’s kind of a multi-stakeholder body. It’s got you know, folks from the company. It’s got folks from the local government in Imperial County in California. It’s got a couple of members from like local community development organizations and nonprofits on it. So it really does have a lot of different voices at the table. And you know, I think if this mine comes also with something like training programs for folks who live in the region and you know, kind of job development programs, then we could see this be something that really does benefit the whole community. But you know, that’s, I think the nuances of that are still are still being worked out. And the one government official who I spoke to in Imperial County when I was reporting this story out, said that so far, you know, I asked him like, does it seem like, you know, the voices of people who live in this region are really gonna be heard, like who has more say, you know, on this, on this panel. And he was like, well, everybody’s getting along for now, so… which is good looking out in the future, but we’ll see. I mean, there’s just any number of directions this could go. Tamara Winter: Wow. Audrey Carleton: I think a lot about the term like ‘sacrifice zone’ which is one that’s commonly used to talk about oil and gas projects. And even in Brooklyn, there was this pipeline that went up, has gone up over the last couple of years. And that term was kind of used a lot, was like you know, this region is a ‘sacrifice zone’ for this infrastructure. With pipelines it’s a little bit different because it’s kind of like, you know this infrastructure just runs through your area, but it doesn’t really create any jobs other than the jobs that are required to build it in the first place. But then once it’s built, it’s kind of built. With a mine it’s a little different because I think you know there’s a more steady kind of flow of work involved in that process. But yeah, I mean, nothing is really guaranteed and we see this all the time with fossil fuel projects where, you know, there’s been some semblance of input from a local community that for example, like really needs funding for education or really needs funding for a certain, you know, social good. And so when they get the chance to kind of tap into something like, you know, some sort of resource that’s really, really lucrative then they’ll often, you know, leaders will ultimately decide to say yes to it, but it’s a trade off. Because it does come with health consequences and then often that, that doesn’t end up panning out the jobs.There’s no commitments or no contracts that say the jobs have to go to people who live in that region. So these are kind of promises that are often made in the first kind of planning stages of a project, but aren’t ever really kept. That’s not to say that’s always what happens, but it is a very distinct possibility with any project that you know, it’s not that this trade off ends up being like the people who live here and have lived here forever, and for whom this is really their home and their community, they don’t get any of the benefits of this. In fact, they just get an influx of people from outside who come and that can lead to all kinds of things. It can lead to displacement/ I mean if we compare this to the Silicon Valley and look at the displacement that happened in Northern California as a result of that. You know, that’s a distinct possibility here. But mostly, I mean, when I think about these things, I think about the health impacts cause there’s pretty much no form of resource extraction that comes without any kind of health consequence for the people who live near it, whether that’s like air pollution in particulate matter and asthma or you know, ingesting like runoff and toxins that have leached into your waterways. Like all of these things come with consequences. And so if it were to be that the community and the Salton Sea only kind of gets those negative consequences and none of the benefits, none of the economic benefits that they’re saying, you know, they’re expressing interest in, that they’re saying that they want, then, that would be like a huge injustice. But I mean, if I’m being frank, I think it’s one that like a company like General Motors would be able to get away with because oil and gas companies have been doing this kind of thing for years. And there’s only recent attention to environmental justice as a concept. But you know, there’s nothing that would, I don’t know, I guess I’m just cynical. I think that the company would probably be able to get away with it. Tamara Winter: I don’t know if I totally disagree, you know, I hope that people will keep writing about it and talking about it. And I do wonder if the tide is turning a little bit. But yeah, I don’t, I don’t know if we have like full, like a hundred percent reason to be optimistic. I know, I’m going to wind get this down and basically just ask you one, is there anything that I, that you think is really important that I, or listeners of the podcast should know that we haven’t talked about? Audrey Carleton: I feel like we’ve covered a lot of stuff. We’ve covered a fair amount of ground. I would say, I just think this is going to be a new, massive frontier in kind of the energy transition. There are probably going to be mines popping up all over the place and other mines. I mean, this one is not as controversial, but the Thacker Pass Mine in Nevada has become like wildly controversial and sort of represents this new intense kind of question of like, what are we willing to sacrifice in order to get to a renewable economy and whether we can kind of maintain the scale of consumption that we’re at and still, you know, avert the climate crisis. Like I think that this question around lithium is so interesting from an environmental perspective, but also weirdly like a philosophical one because you know, we have certain needs that we, as a species have gotten used to having like heat and electricity and cars and the ability to travel and the ability to shop and go places and mail people things. And if we want to maintain that, we’re gonna need an energy source, but no energy source comes without consequences. So it’s kind of just about minimizing those things. And I think this is a really interesting time to be looking at this right now because it’s so new, but I think that we are only going to continue to see more mines and more protests and more lawsuits against companies that are aiming to mine. And I also really staunchly believe that if we want to see a just transition, that means that we cannot treat people and the earth in the way that the fossil fuel and the coal industry has treated people and the earth. And, you know, those processes of permitting plants and permitting drill rigs and stuff and oil wells historically have been rife with violations and like, you know, like bad things happen in oil fields every day. There is illegal dumping all the time, you know, like this is a really, really difficult space to regulate. And I think if we want, you know, our new renewable economy to not come with some of those negative things, we need to hold these companies that are leading it to account. And so I think this is gonna be just like a really interesting sign of where we’re at in terms of that to see, how the creation of these minds play, plays out. And I think it’s like a really interesting, the Lithium Valley Commission and this one community and, you know, the kind of dynamics, the political dynamics at play here are really kind of interesting litmus test of that. Tamara Winter: Absolutely. Audrey, thank you so much for this. I learned a ton. I read your article, which is fantastic, but I learned a ton in just talking with you. So I’m so grateful that you took time to chat with me. I really appreciate it. Audrey Carleton: Yeah. Thank you so much. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Our associate producer and editor was Astrid Landon. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. Original music for this episode was composed by Auribus. To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, our films, and a whole lot more, visit press.stripe.com. Alright, that’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Tamara Winter: The global supply chain is like an industrial ballet. An intricately choreographed dance of manufacturers, distributors, and transportation infrastructure that physically moves materials and products across the globe. However just like a ballet, when one dancer stumbles - the whole production can go sideways very quickly. Archived audio: This is what the traffic bottleneck looks like at the ports of LA and Long Beach. Tamara Winter: In the fall of 2021, with holidays fast approaching, a record number of ships sat waiting just off of the Port of Long Beach, California, unable to unload billions worth of cargo. Fifty miles north in Malibu, the pristine coastline looked more like the area’s notoriously congested freeways. Cargo ships also stretched south, some 100 miles or so towards San Diego, not too far from the border of Mexico. Archived audio: The backup is mostly due to a surge in imports because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tamara Winter: Online sales increased more than 30% since the beginning of the pandemic, and continued to rise throughout 2021. Local lockdowns, and physical constraints on workforces, compounded the problem until, in the lead up to the holidays, it reached a breaking point. Archived audio: The complex delays at the nation’s busiest ports, accounting for 40% of the country’s container traffic, affects consumers from coast to coast. Tamara Winter: One person monitoring the situation closely was Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a technology platform for global logistics. When he heard the news stories about the backlogs at California ports, he took action. He hired a boat, toured the ports, and then he took to Twitter. In 30 tweets he laid out his five-point plan to ease the bottleneck. Soon he was on the phone with California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia was implementing some of his recommendations. So how does someone end up writing what came to be known as “the tweetstorm that saved Christmas”? Welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press all about big ideas in infrastructure. I’m your host Tamara Winter and today we are sitting down with Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen to understand how he thinks about trade, the way he understands the intersection of government and technology, and why he founded Flexport in the first place. We cover a lot of ground talking about everything from ancient trade routes to what Flexport is doing to help during the present crisis in Ukraine. I hope you enjoy this conversation with Ryan Petersen. Tamara Winter: This is a really long time coming. I almost feel like the hipsters, like I knew you before, my dad was reading like cover stories about you. People now know you for donating lots of money to Ukraine or saving Christmas, but some of us, some of us have been here before that. Maybe we’ll start with what is Flexport? Ryan Petersen: Well, Flexport is a technology platform for global logistics. We make it possible for companies of any size to ship anything anywhere. And simply that process try to bring kind of utility grade infrastructure to an industry that’s kind of taped together by duct tape and emailed Excel files and PDF attachments and stuff. And we can make this seamless, our mission is to make global trade easy for everyone, but we want to make trade so easy there will be more trade as a result of when we’re finished. 20 years ago, I ran a small business buying products and China and selling them on the internet and was very frustrated by my experience, dealing with logistics and felt just like…George Bernard Shaw says every profession is a conspiracy against the laity. And it felt like that, like anytime I dealt with these companies, it just seemed like there was, nobody could tell me where my stuff was, how much it was gonna cost, whatever they told me, ended up costing more, a lot of really confusing paperwork, regulations, documents that were needed, data that needed to be collected and shared with the governments and stuff. And it just, nobody was there to hold my hand and make this easy for me. And it’s an industry full of code words, acronyms and Viking English, weird language is used all the time. And kind of like an all boys club, literally an all boys club, there’s lot of men working in this industry. And like, it’s very hard to parse as an outsider. When you’d ask someone to explain it to you—my working model now that I’ve kind of been on the other side is that I think that the industry treats these words, these acronyms, this lingo, as kind of a rookie detector. And it’s kind of icky. Like I want to work with companies that just want help people. And it should be a really fun industry. You get to help entrepreneurs, you get to help businesses achieve their goals, right? But it’s so important. Like we probably lifted a billion people outta poverty in the last 50 years through free market economics and adoption of global, free trading type policies around the world. And yeah, it’s like, here’s something that’s really important, interesting in my view, fun and really broken. It’s like, it’s a good heat map for where you should go work and what you could, what, where you could like build a career and do something interesting. Tamara Winter: In a word, the thing that you’re fixing is transaction costs, it’s funny. I was born in Nigeria and every time I go back, my mom’s like, “Look, if we’re at the market, don’t say anything”, because as soon as I do, it’s like, you sound like an NPR host, I’m immediately gonna charge you, you know, 40% more or whatever. Ryan Petersen: This is when you go back now? Tamara Winter: Yeah, exactly. Right. Ryan Petersen: How old were you when you left Nigeria? Tamara Winter: Two months. I just want to get into, you know, you live and breathe logistics so much so that, tell me about your daughter’s Halloween costume last year. Ryan Petersen: Well, my wife gets all my credit for this. We dressed my daughter, she made a wagon into a container ship, like a little radio flyer wagon, and made it into the Evergiven container ship. And we dressed my daughter like a sailor and had her drive, you know, ride around and pulled her around in that thing. And we even at some point blocked traffic with it. Tamara Winter: [laughs] But I’m sure nobody minded because it’s like this beautiful little girl just being driven around. Ryan Petersen: It was super fun. Tamara Winter: Tell me about, so we talked about, why you started, how you got to starting Flexport, but I wanna go back even earlier. What was your upbringing like? How does somebody raise a child that goes on to, you know, I don’t know, save Christmas? Ryan Petersen: [laughs] Saving Christmas. So my mom is an entrepreneur actually. And she’s an expert on food safety and like regulations, the intersection of food safety and government regulations. So helping companies to comply with food safety regs and, and build healthier food supply chains. I do kind of think she raised my brother and I to be entrepreneurs. We used to get our allowance by delivering sodas to her office. And like we had to sell them, we would buy the sodas at Safeway or something, sell them to her office and make, you know, make a spread. Tamara Winter: [laughs] And then that was your allowance? Ryan Petersen: Yeah, that was how we got allowance. It was good money. She allowed us to overcharge her for the sodas. We’d go to Costco and buy, blow pops in bulk. And I’d sell them to all the other kids in my middle school. I don’t think at the time I was thinking about entrepreneurship, obviously, she never talked to me about that, but both my brother and I became entrepreneurs. Tamara Winter: It’s interesting how many parallels there are to different parts of the series, but the very first episode with Mwiya who is building a city in Zambia, his father was like one of the chief architects of Zambia’s finance ecosystem, but his mother was an entrepreneur. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, my mom’s a huge influence on me. My brother’s probably even more so. My brother’s a born entrepreneur too. And, when I graduated from college, I didn’t have a lot of prospects for gainful employment. Tamara Winter: Why? Ryan Petersen: I don’t know, I went to UC Berkeley. I was really interested in international development. The question of like, why are some countries poor and some countries rich? Tamara Winter: You didn’t want to become an economist? Ryan Petersen: I didn’t have the skillset for that. And then no, I didn’t wanna do like a PhD in economics. Honestly, I’m very skeptical of it all. So my brother hired me working for this trading company. Tamara Winter: Is he older or younger? Ryan Petersen: My older brother, yeah. And he was a computer programmer at Intel and he was taking his salary and using it to buy stuff in China and sell it on the internet. Just like very entrepreneurial. This is, late nineties, early 2000. So there was a tech startup scene, but we weren’t part of that. It was like just a couple kids trying to make some money. Tamara Winter: And are you from Berkeley? Ryan Petersen: Bethesda, Maryland. Washington DC. Tamara Winter: So this is interesting because you are sort of like right in the heart of government. And you’re in Bethesda. And for anyone who’s listening, who doesn’t know about Bethesda, Bethesda is where sort of the children of bureaucrats grow up. Ryan Petersen: Well, my dad worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. My dad’s a computer programmer actually, wrote his first code that was like in production, in use in the seventies when he was working, it was actually evaluating Soviet defense. Eventually my mom started this business that does food safety and she needed software to evaluate risk of pesticides and applying like, okay, if we use this pesticide, what will happen based on the dietary data of the whole United States population? What’s the safety implications of various pesticides? And so he wrote that software. And that’s still the software that the U.S. government uses to evaluate pesticide risk assessment in the United States, is written by my father. Tamara Winter: So in some ways the marriage of government and technology or commerce is just like a very natural one for you. I’m curious about your philosophical influences. I mean, I’m hearing some like Hayek in what you’re saying. I was looking at some of the books that you recommended and I mean, they’re everywhere from The Goal to just like interesting philosophical read. So tell me, who are the sort of intellectual influences on how you think? Ryan Petersen: The thing I love about reading is like, if, if you’re reading good books, every good book you read should point you to like two or three more. I don’t think I ever really read a book by the way, cover to cover on my own until I was about 25 years old. I’m serious. I like hacked my way through college and like, you know, found the Cliff Notes or whatever. When I was 25, I was living in China and running this sort of business that would export products from China, studying Chinese in the morning and exporting products to sell in the United States. I was living there and all of a sudden books became incredibly scarce and I was kind of bored. I didn’t have that many friends. And so when, you know, there’s not a lot of English bookstores at that time. In the part of China I was living. So I would go to Hong Kong and buy like a backpack full of books and bring ’em back. And so that’s when I really became a reader. I think I read over, over like 75 books in one year that year. And it’s become a real passion of mine. The biggest influences, I think that the aha moments where I was like, whoa, this changed my worldview, probably like Richard Dawkins and reading The Selfish Gene and understanding something about evolution and genetics. And then building from that is a book that really changed my worldview is called Complexity, Waldrop is the guy’s name. And it’s about complex adaptive systems. And this idea of feedback thresholds of complexity, when a system has enough interacting parts that at some point there’s this threshold of complexity it reaches, and it has emergent properties and it changes. So take hydrogen and oxygen. It’s pretty simple, but if you put them together, at some point you get enough of these molecules together and you got the emergent property of wetness of water, but there’s nothing about hydrogen or oxygen that if you looked at them, you would say, oh, this will—there’s wetness here. Like, no, it happens at some level of complexity when you put enough of these together. And so that was the first book that set me on that. And the one that I found that I really recommend to people, it’s not a book, it’s an Audible course called Big History. And it’s the application of complexity theory to the history of the world starting at the Big Bang all the way to the present. And then when you start to see that you can apply that in business is when it gets really fun. And that many, you know, it’s many of these things are just fascinating to watch, be able to apply an idea from one discipline to another. I think that’s where you get the most innovation is taking an idea from biology and applying it to business. Society tends to create specialists. And I really like being a generalist, understanding a little bit about everything and then you get creativity because you’re putting ideas from different disciplines that no one ever thought to combine. And my most recent inspiration has been a guy named John Boyd who’s a military strategist and talks about, how do you manage volatility and chaos, which is something that the military has to be really good at. And what is, what are the attributes of an organization that in the middle of complete chaos fog of war, what’s going on here can still take decisive action and not be caught like in survival mode and fail. And I think that’s something I’ve been trying to apply a lot at Flexport because we’re in a lot of chaos all the time. And if we can make sure we’re still playing offense, like understanding what’s happening around us and taking decisive action and then learning based on our actions. Tamara Winter: Okay. Tell me about trade routes. Maybe you can paint a picture for me sort of about the evolution of modern logistics. Ryan Petersen: Oh wow. Oh, well trade is something there’s, there’s evidence of long distance trade between human beings that far predates even things like art. Tamara Winter: Yeah. Ryan Petersen: Possibly predates language like 10, 50,000 or more years ago, you can, you can find evidence that humans were transporting things over a long distance. It goes for a really long time, even like the invention of the boat. The invention of the boat happened in like Mesopotamia, where what they were actually doing is transporting goods down river. And what they would do is build these wooden boats, cover them with animal skins so they could float down river and then scrap the boat, but keep the animal skins and hike back and do that over and over again. That was tens of thousands of years ago, like before agriculture, even. So this is an ancient, really ancient industry. I think you could probably date the more modern form with the age of exploration and sort of like Prince Henry, the navigator in Portugal. And actually you really wanna tie that to the Mongol invasions. So the Islamic empire kind of separated Europe from the east and they traded a lot, but the Islamic empires were in between and they were the middle man and they marked everything up like 10x and made a lot of money became rich doing that. And during the Mongol invasion, the Mongols came and defeated the caliphate in Baghdad and opened it up. And that’s where you get like Marco Polo, right, traveling to the east and kind of saw the riches of Asia and Europe for the first time was trading. And that was about a hundred year window when it was open. And then it came kind of crashing back down. The iron curtain of the Islamic empire came back and Europe was like, wait a minute. We, like, we just saw, all those riches we wanna get in on these like cheap spices and all the other stuff, the silks and everything. And so it started with the Portuguese trying to find a way around Africa and they started, this is like the original kind of like technology industry. They had to build all kinds of astronomic instruments to be able to tell where you are. It was about, I want to say 1350 is when they really started that program. And 1498 is when they rounded the horn of Africa and made it into India. Now, it’s not all beautiful. Like obviously there’s terrible things that happen. Like the first thing they did was kill a whole bunch of people who were on their way to the Hajj Islamic pilgrimage. It’s easy to kind of see yourself in these people. Especially as like a European descent person like myself, I’m like, oh yeah, I came from these people, but they were like really superstitious, very different types of people. They saw themselves in a holy war against Islam it was really, like reverse jihad crusade from the beginning. But very quickly they set up trading centers and the spices were like 1/1000th of price or something like that. Maybe, maybe that’s a bit, but it was so much cheaper if you could go to the source and not just in India, but all the way to the Spice Islands, which is, I think, modern day, the Malukus or Indonesia. And so it suddenly became very, very rich. It was kind of the original venture capital that if you sent a ship to the Malukus and it made it back, you made like eight extra money and yeah, only half the people made it back, but you still got four extra money. You know, only half the ships made it back. So that’s kind of the origin. And I think where it really comes to the next level is in the, I want to say like one of the Dutch East India Companies, the first joint stock companies, or the first public company you could buy shares in was a shipping company, the Crown of the Netherlands and later England and France to the certain extent gave monopolies on trade and in exchange for, the crown would take 20%, but then if you wanted a trade with the east, only this one company could trade. And so that was like 1700s, 1800s the East India Company, but there’s terrible things, of course: trading slaves, trading opium was big, we don’t want to pretend like all of the trade was always great and you do need regulations and there’s good reasons to have like all the rules that we have around trade today, but yeah, it’s a fascinating industry and it’s like really cool to be part of that today. Probably the most important thing, I would argue that the most important technology of the last 50 years is the shipping container. At least in terms of like lifting people out of poverty and unifying the world, creating globalization and yet, it hasn’t really changed. We still unload these ships one container at a time. It’s just like, there’s not a lot of innovation and it makes sense because it’s hard to change an organization, an institution, a way of doing things. Tamara Winter: That actually sort of beautifully dovetails into what I wanted to ask you next. You know, most people tend to think of supply chains from a consumer point of view, right? So you know, earlier this week I ordered my favorite version of Clif Bars, this is a peanut butter banana one, and you know, I press some buttons on Amazon and it comes to me. So that’s the typical way people think about supply chains, but can you talk about how the supply chain affects the economy more broadly? Ryan Petersen: Well, it’s the circulatory system for the economy. The supply chain can be a lot of things. It’s also the manufacturing and things, the raw materials, there’s a great paper called I, Pencil. You know what I’m talking about? I, Pencil? Tamara Winter: I love I, Pencil. For anyone who’s not listening, the founder of FEE, the Foundation for Economic Education. It’s a great essay about trade, about how a pencil gets made called I, Pencil. Yeah. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, yeah. And it’s basically the idea that like, there’s no human being that understands how you make a pencil and you couldn’t possibly make something simple as a pencil because you have to understand, okay, what is it made of? It’s got wood. It’s got like maybe rubber, some graphite in the middle and some kind of aluminum rapper. It’s like, okay, to make that, you need to understand how to cut down trees. Okay. How do you cut down a tree? You need a saw, okay, now I need to know metallurgy. It’s like right away, you give up. There’s no one, you know, of course there’s some people who know metallurgy, but now to make rubber, okay. I need to know how to grow rubber trees, do the little thing where they cut the slit in it, you know, capture the rubber, process it. The same for aluminum, same for graphite. And then create, I have no idea how they put the graphite inside the wood, but they have to do that too. It’s like, there’s no one who could do all of that. And then imagine that on an insane complexity of the modern economy, where everything is connected to everything else, and we all take it for granted. And that fundamentally it’s the supply chain. How does this connect to one another? How do we connect companies, people and the ideas that go into those products, right? Adam Smith has a great quote, he’s like, “I never saw a dog exchange a bone with another dog.” It’s something that only humans do. And we depend on it to an insane degree. It’s what advances civilization and progress because every time two people trade with one another, there’s a mutually beneficial exchange. And so value is created from that process. I give you something that you value more than what you gave me, I think it’s a foundational aspect of like, how we rise up as a human civilization, as a, human you know, species. I think it’s actually one of the dangerous things in globalization, is you lose kind of some of the uniqueness of different cultures and different civilizations and being uniquely good at something. Probably the most important economist, if not the most famous, is David Ricardo explained how this value creation takes place when two people trade. But if everybody has the same ideas, then all you get is like, oh, we have slightly different geographic attributes, geologic attributes, you have coal and we have timber or something. It’s not, not that interesting when all the ideas are the same. And you lose some of that if there’s cultural monotone, like all the civilizations have the same ideas. It’s not very interesting. I love to travel and I think I used to like to travel even more because the internet has kind of created a lot of monoculture. You can get avocado toast anywhere you want on planet Earth now, it’s like a sign elites are traveling in the neighborhood. I hate seeing avocado toast when I’m in some foreign country. And you know, you want to live in a world where there’s like more cultural diversity and I think it can lead to more interesting exchange of ideas and exchange of products and things. Tamara Winter: There’s a great Verge article that I think about constantly called Welcome to Airspace. And it’s all about the Airbnbification of everything. The last time I was in Zambia, I just tweeted pictures. Like, where do you think I am right now? And I got like, oh, Miami, San Francisco. And I was like, nope, I am in Lusaka, Zambia. And it looks like I’m in Miami. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. I bet you can get avocado toast there. Tamara Winter: You actually can. And you know what? The avocado toast was some of the best avocado toast I’ve ever had, I’m still thinking about that avocado toast. Alright, I’m ready to talk about Flexport. What is the problem that Flexport was created to solve? Ryan Petersen: It’s fundamentally that it’s too hard to buy products in another country and import them into a different country, ship them around the world, clear them through customs, get them delivered, where they need to go. And this is for businesses, like helping a company solve this problem that they shouldn’t honestly have to have this big bureaucratic department pushing paper to do the things, it should be automatic like, companies need to be really good at two things: make an awesome product that’s high quality at scale that people want—very, very hard, almost a nightmare to do that in this world—and then even harder in my view is be differentiated, like build a brand, a customer connection, sell the product. So supply and demand, right? It’s like the core attributes of a business. And if they’re doing all this other stuff like compliance and spending time on paperwork and shipping and routing containers and tracking things like, it’s not really value added work. It should be an automatic kind of utility scale, just reliable thing that’s out there. And that’s what we, that’s what we’re building. Very, very hard problem, because if you wanna ship a single, let’s call it a pallet of goods. Tamara Winter: Yeah, I actually would love you to walk me through, you know, if I’m, if I’m the, you know, the Clif company, what actually does it take to ship this from wherever it was made now I’m kind of scared, to me in, in New York. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and so if you’re, if you’re making well, let’s say—I don’t know enough about Clif Bars, so I don’t wanna speak to, that specific company, but let’s say you’re making a pallet of some new, like cool hardware company, maybe these headphones right here. And you’re trying, they’re probably made in Shenzhen or thereabouts, in Southern China. And if you were to try to get those products made and shipped in a smaller batch, let’s take, because I want to show you it’s very normal to ship like a pallet of stuff. It should be even more normal than it is, except it’s really hard. But let’s say we’re shipping a pallet. So we’re talking about like one meter cubed of stuff that needs to ship around the world and it’s going to be—okay, how many companies are gonna be involved in this transaction? I’m shipping this from, let’s say Shenzhen to St. Louis. Alright, I’ve got a pallet of stuff and it’s going to go by ocean freight to save money—air freight’s pretty expensive. I’ve got the factory that’s gonna pick these up. So I’ve got to send a truck to pick it up, bring it to a warehouse where it’s gonna be consolidated with other customers’ cargo, put into a container. I’ve got to find a container somewhere. I’ve got to then get another truck that takes that container to the port. A customs brokerage needs to clear it out of the port, out of the country. I’m now at seven companies involved in this transaction and I haven’t left the home country yet. Seven different companies. Put it on a ship is eight, clear it through customs on the other side of the world, bring it to the port, 10 companies, another truck picks it up, brings it to a warehouse. That’s 12 companies. Another truck brings it to your final warehouse for wherever it’s destined. I’m not even like in the store yet. Oh. And by the way, there’s a bank that’s providing a payment on this transaction, maybe it’s Stripe. There’s a insurance company that’s going to underwrite in case something gets lost or damaged in the way. So I’ve got like 13, 15 companies, very normal thing to have that. Tamara Winter: And I don’t even have my headphones yet. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Your headphones haven’t got to the consumer, right. And so warehouse pick, pack and delivery. Fundamentally the problems come about because everybody in this chain is operating off of like a very local set of data of what can they see about the transaction. And yet they’re dependent on each other in a chain. Humans have to be involved in some of it. Compliance is at stake. You can’t just ship anything across international borders for good reasons. Counterfeit, drugs, arms, people, who knows what can be shipped, right? So you need these regulations. And so that’s the fundamental problem is how do we get data to the company that needs to do something, connect with that asset, with that truck, with that ship, if there’s an asset involved, show them what to do. They need data to do their job. And then they have to tell us what they’ve done and share data back. And that’s, that’s fundamentally, what’s different. We call this business a freight forwarder. That’s what we call this industry that solves this problem. Because if you’re a startup making headphones, you definitely don’t wanna be dealing with 15 companies every time you ship your pallet of headphones. So you call a freight forwarder and then a freight forwarder deals with the complexity. I often joke it should called freight email forwarding because they basically just like email everybody and make it happen. And you don’t have to deal with that. What Flexport does differently is build interfaces, web interface, mobile interface, increasingly it’s about APIs and connectivity to software talking to software so that, that data can flow to and from these parties and get visibility at what’s happening, control over what’s happening, to help smooth that transaction, make it cheaper, make it faster. Hopefully we can route around disruptions in supply chain. We can find you better routings and cheaper, faster, more options and make that process better. Tamara Winter: You have had an inside look, more so than most, into what part of the supply chain has broken down in the past couple of years, you know, there’s the like sort of evergreen headline in this, in these unprecedented times. What in the supply chain broke down? Can you just help me understand that? Ryan Petersen: A lot of things, I mean, I think fundamentally what’s happened is that consumers really shifted their buying patterns rapidly overnight. When we all locked down and stop going to restaurants, hotels, bars, travel, all these things that are in the, what we call services, massages, like stuff that you just stop doing, tended to be services and we all shifted our spend onto goods. Income didn’t fall that much. A lot of people were out of work, especially if you worked in the services businesses, but the government really printed a lot of money and did a lot of stimulus. So people had money, money burns a hole in your pocket, you’ve got to spend it you know, you’ve got to get your dopamine somewhere. So people just kept buying stuff on Amazon and elsewhere, e-commerce went crazy. So you had this big shift from services onto goods and with all those goods purchases that just put incredible stress on our supply chain, manufacturing companies and couldn’t keep up. And so a lot of things kept breaking down. On logistics, it’s a simpler story. We just didn’t have enough infrastructure, not enough containers, not enough chassis—these are the trailers that haul containers—not enough drivers for the trucks, not enough container ships, the ports that we have didn’t have enough throughput to keep up with all the excess volume. So like volume of containers is up 20% over pre-pandemic levels. Things started to break down just by just not being able to keep up with the demand. Tamara Winter: I’m thinking back to when my poor dad had to sit through me and Swan Lake. I mean, if one thing goes wrong, if the Nutcracker, you know, falls, everybody falls. And, and it sounds like that is kind of a, there’s a similar level of fragility in our supply chain, which I don’t know that most people appreciated, because again, there’s a pencil right here. All you can see is, you know, the pencil that gets to you. And a lot of that complexity is just kind of hidden. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. And markets work like for the most part and the price mechanisms respond. And you gotta be careful what if the price goes way up for ocean freight, which it has, it’s like up five x or so over pre pandemic levels, and there’s a lot of push right now, Congress is trying to bring it back down through regulations. We’ve got more talk about price controls than we’ve had, like in my lifetime right now. And it’s pretty dangerous because that high price is a signal to market participants. Hey, there’s money to be made. If you can bring a ship to market, if you can build a ship and that’s how markets are supposed to function. So you take out the price mechanism and you will not get more goods in response to the demand. And like, what we need is more supply, and that’s what prices are for. So when prices go up, I know a lot of government politicians, or it’s popular to say, oh, corporations are greedy, but like, maybe so, but the mechanism is price is high. Oh, wait, there’s opportunity here. And people surge onto that. And that’s, it’s amazing. It is a ballet like that. It all works. And it works because of the price mechanism basically. But it’s also amazing that it works given how screwed up humans are, like human nature is pretty screwed up. And like the fact that it all works is kind of a miracle. Like people have all, we’re kind of like beasts inside and have all these crazy emotions and terrible things, yet the economy mostly works and it’s, we can call it fragile, but it’s been relatively resilient. Tamara Winter: Tell me about some of the misconceptions that people have about global trade. You’ve become kind of a go-to expert, like what are the sort of things people just get wrong over and over again? Ryan Petersen: The idea that trade is exploitative, I think is a really interesting one. Like you have this whole fair trade movement, which I don’t quite get because trade is like mutually beneficial exchange or the idea that someone’s being exploited here, doesn’t really add up to me. I think you do need really good regulations on like externalities, like environmental damage and there’s great reason to have rules, like to protect environment, and labor safety standards and things like this, child labor and all that. But like, that’s not a trade. That’s just like good governance. The trade aspect of like one company exchanging something for money on the other side of the world, that’s like, that is the heartbeat of wealth creation, value creation, the engine of prosperity. And so to take it away, I’ve found to be really dangerous. That’s like one criticism. I think the valid criticisms that I’m very much like really interested in or the stuff I was getting to earlier on like global monoculture. Like if it’s the same product sold everywhere on planet Earth, the Earth becomes less interesting. And it’s maybe that’s like a privileged white guy thing to say, because like, I want to go to Zambia and experience like Zambian culture and like, show me what Zambia is like and make it different. Whereas Zambian people are like, look, we’re trying to be less poor. Tamara Winter: Yeah. Ryan Petersen: We want to have a life like you have. And who am I to say like, oh, you can’t, I don’t want you to benefit from like Western nice things. I want you to live with the way Zambains always lived in my mind. Tamara Winter: Look, I didn’t wanna say it, but I, you know, I was thinking it, but I’ll tell you what, next time I go back to Nkwashi, I’ll take you with me. You’ve touched on this a lot, but I wanna ask you explicitly, you know, there’s an inverse relationship between trade and poverty. And I’m hoping you can offer some sort of like more examples of this and expand on that point a little bit, because it’s one that I believe really strongly. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and well, we’ve seen it over the last 50 years. I think China’s probably the best place we can point to where we lifted 600 million people or so from below the poverty line, it’s really an economic miracle. But it’s not unique to China. Korea’s a great example. Export led growth in Korea. Dubai is a more modern example where liberalization and opening things up and allowing trade to take place. I think it’s well rounded in economic theory, which I’m skeptical of, but in empirical data, you can just look and see that the countries that trade more, become more prosperous. And it’s a little dangerous in my view, there is nothing that says that all progress is up and to the right, Like we kind of think so, because we feel like we’re in a golden age and the world’s never been richer. And the graph of GDP is just like this amazing exponential curve. Four percent annual growth, but if you do it for 500 years, you get like an insane exponential curve. But that does not have to be the case. And if you look across 10,000 years of human civilization, there are these waves of progress and then collapse. And we’re right now at a crossroads where trade has not been so unpopular in a long time, you’ve got trade wars between China and the United States. You’ve got pretty much both parties in the United States, no longer supporting a free trading agenda. You’ve got war as we speak unfolding in Ukraine, which has made trade and economic sanctions into a weapon. I’m not necessarily arguing you shouldn’t do this, but we should talk about the consequences. Russia and Ukraine combined are number one and number five in grain exports. And Belarus is I think number one in fertilizer exports in potash. Take Africa over the last 40 years, Africa’s made huge amounts of progress at five x the output of food in the continent per capita over the last 40-50 years. But a lot of that’s dependent on fertilizer imports. And so if you suddenly remove all these fertilizer imports and that’s going to be even for the food sufficient nations, all of a sudden they might not be. And a lot of countries take Egypt or many Middle Eastern countries are net food importers and they buy a lot of grain from Russia and Ukraine. And if that’s removed from the market, food insecurity is what leads to civil war, famine, anarchy, right. And we’re on some level, we’re going to find out just how important globalization and trade is because we’ve taken it for granted. We’ve become incredibly dependent on it. And if you suddenly rip that carpet out, it’s almost, it’s a pretty unfair to these countries who were sold a bag like, hey, you’ll be able to get goods from anywhere. It’s very scary. I’m very worried about it. Tamara Winter: It’s really interesting because there are, you know, the first order effects that I think even those, I don’t know that they’re very well understood. But the second order effects I think are really poorly understood. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and the second order effects, third order effects. I mean, it’s really anyone who thinks they could predict all of this. I have no idea, but very few people predicted, like realized that actually the governments really aren’t nearly as important as the people in the west and in the social media world, just reacting. And then every company feeling like, oh, we can’t do business in Russia anymore. Tamara Winter: Right? Like Coca-Cola. Ryan Petersen: Even if we’re allowed to legally, we just can’t, and backing off. And that probably was not part of the calculus of like, you know, we’re not, McDonald’s is not required to shut down all their stories, but they just did. Tamara Winter: It’s like interesting, you know, 30 years ago or whatever you see, like those incredible images of the first McDonald’s opening post-Iron Curtain falling. And now, you know, McDonald’s is like pulling out. It’s just, it’s really interesting and visceral. You talk often about cargo as capital. What does that mean when you talk about cargo as capital? Ryan Petersen: Well, just inventories is another form of dollars, the money has taken a different form for a period of time. I mean, that’s trade fundamentally is you’ve exchanged dollars for this other thing, which is a form of capital, working capital, inventory. I think many logistics companies and logistics companies that are buying logistics services, brands, the logistics department is not really thinking in these terms. This is classic, like finance teams think about this. Like they see it on the inventory and on the balance sheet, as you know, working capital, inventory is another line item there. But the logistics teams of the world have been trained, just like buy cheap freight as cheap as they can get the service to buy freight. They’re not really doing the math, which is not that sophisticated, but it takes one degree of sophistication more to realize that, hey, you know what, if you can ship that container 30% faster, then that’s 30% less inventory at any given moment sitting on the water, being unproductive, doing nothing useful. And so you should be willing. Now you can do the math. Are you willing to pay a premium for faster freight in order to get that cash back and reinvest it in your business in more interesting ways and put it to work? This is why, that’s one of the reasons why very high value products will ship by air. You don’t want something really, really valuable sitting on the ocean for a month. One, it might get damaged, but no, it’s more, it’s not valuable have a container load of iPhones. I’ve not done the math. Well, we could probably do the math pretty quickly. There would be probably 50,000 iPhones in a container, times a thousand bucks, each 50 million in an iPhone. I made this up. I have no idea, but I’m just doing it in my head, 50 million dollars. There’s better things Apple can do with 50 million bucks, like run some more ads and pay for air freight, which isn’t that expensive given the value of those products. So those will ship by air. There’s some degree of that, but the typical logistics team doesn’t think that way. And at Flexport, we try to get to, hey, can we help you be heroes, help you represent this data to your CFO so they can see the option like, oh, wow. I could, if I ship, if I pay a little bit more to ship it faster, I get the money back and improve my working capital situation. Tamara Winter: I want to talk about containerization, because I’ve asked you very little about that. You know, shipping containers are kind of, the heart of global trade and of the basic unit for measuring global trade. I want to know, is more generally better when it comes to containerization? Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Well I think containers revolutionized trade. We probably reduced the cost of shipping things by like 95 to 99%, depending on the commodity. You see these old photographs, we have some in the Flexport office, like there’s this photographer who worked at the port of Oakland as a longshoreman and was also a photographer. And he took these beautiful pictures right at the dawn of the container era. So they have some containerization, but they also had these guys doing backbreaking work, like hauling sacks on their bag, loading the ships. And the way the ships were loaded was like, literally like tying rope to tie it all down and unbelievably laborious. And it would take a week or more to load a ship, which is not a good use of an asset. Like you’ve got to get this thing moving. It makes money when it sails. So containerization revolutionized the world and made trade possible, made it possible to buy things from around the world and find, you know, allow economic opportunity, jobs to be created and us to have cheap stuff as well. However, there’s been very little progress in that since the seventies when this took place. I don’t think the container itself needs to change form factor. It seems like basically correct. But the process by which they get loaded, unloaded from the ships, seems like there’s a lot of opportunity besides just like, pluck one container at a time off the ship. Like it would be fun to do a design contest where there’s some really creative types. Tamara Winter: Maybe you should. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, conveyor belt, like PEZ dispenser out the front. I don’t know. There’s got to be some better way to do that. Tamara Winter: There’s so much talk right now about the next World’s Fair. Like bringing or World’s Fair, reviving it. I don’t know. I would love to go and see container ships. I was eating at Mission Rock and we were just watching the container ships, just one by one come through and I, it would be really cool to see like a giant robot crane. Ryan Petersen: Well, the thing to watch is, is the crane up or down? Tamara Winter: What does it mean? Ryan Petersen: Well, if it’s up, it’s not working and just watch they’re, they’re not down that often. Tamara Winter: Tell me, speaking of throughput is the health of global trade, is it primarily about throughput? Ryan Petersen: Well from a logistics standpoint, yeah. It’s all about throughput, efficiency costs, you know, transaction costs. How do we lower the transaction costs to reduce the amount of error? Like most actual transaction costs, some of it comes from humans doing work, but I think at least within Flexport, most of the problems come about through bad quality, bad data rework, like having to redo the thing, getting the, when the data’s wrong, it can lead to, you know, a hundred x more cost. Like if you take a customs clearance, if you file with the right data, it might take you a minute to get the data organized correctly, like a minute of human labor and review the documents, we use machine learning to ingest the data off of, if it is a PDF or Excel file or something, but you still need a human to review it and validate it like for compliance reasons. So it might take you a minute. If the data’s wrong, it might take you two weeks of dealing with customs to sort it out and what went wrong. Tamara Winter: I guess I want to know and this might be intuitive to most people, but why is it so important to have uniform standards across countries on things like shipping container dimensions? I didn’t realize that that actually wasn’t standardized until very recently. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Well, standards are crucially important for, I mean, the container’s an obvious one because if the container’s a different size, then you can’t have a standard size ship, crane, etcetera. If every container’s different, it just leads to chaos. And so that was actually created by the Federal Maritime Commission, which is a U.S. agency, created that standard. And then used that funding mechanism where if you wanted to build a ship, you basically got super cheap capital. As long as you adhered to the standard. You could build another kind of container ship, but why would you do that when like, this is the standard everyone’s using and it’s like free money if you build a ship like that. So that was one way to get a standard. It’s notoriously how hard to get everyone to agree on standards. Tamara Winter: Why? Ryan Petersen: Well, everyone has their own opinions and you have these very boring consortiums, like I’ve never been involved in the, what do you call the web? The, HTML standard setting body that sets CSS and all these things, I would go crazy. I might have an opinion, but I can’t sit through those meetings, which is dangerous because then the standards get set by like the most boring people possible who are willing to sit through such meetings, and actually it’s a very good example is that the, the 40 foot container was not the right standard necessarily. The companies that invented the shipping container where one was using a 24 foot container and one was using a 26 foot container and for their businesses, that was like more optimal for the size and volume of the stuff that they were shipping. And there’s nothing to say that 40 foot is the right amount. In fact, I would argue it’s definitely the wrong standard because for trucks in the United States, domestic trucks, 53 foot is the length of a standard semi truck, which is really silly because we should have 53 foot ocean containers because then on every single shipment you’d have about 30% more cargo per driver per asset move. Tamara Winter: Why is it 40? Ryan Petersen: It was just set that way. Tamara Winter: It was just arbitrary? Ryan Petersen: By the Federal Maritime Commission. I mean, I don’t know, I wasn’t in, in the meetings standard setting body. Tamara Winter: So maybe it’s your fault because you weren’t in the meetings. Ryan Petersen: Or like take the QWERTY keyboard. I mean, it’s notorious like not, it was set to slow you down rather than type fast. So that’s a bad standard, and yet standards are super valuable. If every keyboard was different, you could only use your own computer. I think optimizations are really important here. So for example, all the containers that we ship on average are only 70% full. Like we use, we digitize these packing lists and do the geometry of the cardboard boxes inside and see that they’re only 70% full, there’s 30% extra space right here. Okay, cool. Like you got 30% savings on carbon just by filling the container correctly. That’s not hard. So there are some easy, low hanging fruit, but fundamentally, how do you replace this? And it might be that this is one of the last holdouts where you continue to use fossil fuels, even as we go to electric fleets on cars or nuclear, hopefully nuclear power for the grid. Like you’re probably not gonna get people comfortable. There has been one nuclear power cargo ship in the history of the world, back in the sixties. I don’t think we’re ever going to go back there. Tamara Winter: What happened to it? Ryan Petersen: It got decommissioned. It went for a couple of years. It was like a super fast boat. But it pre-container era. And so when the containers came along, it was retired and I think it was also pre-Chernobyl when people freaked out about nuclear. Tamara Winter: It is so interesting to me, you know, my background, I went from Bethesda to San Francisco too, then to New York. But it was always really interesting to me to observe the way that technologists interact with government. There’s your sort of Stewart Brand style person who is sort of both very interested in government and very interested in technology, but there is, I think a perception that technologists today sort of hate the government and I wonder why it is so important to you and why you have sort of gone out of your way, really to work with governments basically at this point on every level. Ryan Petersen: Well it’s, our business is in clearing goods through U.S. customs. So we, you know, Flexport couldn’t exist until we got a license from the government to be able to do customs clearance and I had to go through FBI background checks, Department of Homeland Security, every customs broker does. So you know, that is our business is complying with government regulations and we don’t have a problem with the government regulations actually. I think there’s good reasons. Of course I can object to certain things. I think tariffs should be lower or have nuance and stuff like that. But like fundamentally governments have every right to control what goods flow into their country and there’s reasons, very good reasons to prevent drugs and certain kinds of weapons and yeah, illicit activity, counterfeits and stuff from crossing border. So the government plays an appropriate role and we’re happy to work with them constructively on that stuff. As a citizen, I am kind of like confused in San Francisco, why the tech community has been so disengaged with the government. I mean, like we have the board of supervisors is our version of the city council here in San Francisco. And it’s like really antagonistic to technology and to business. They just keep passing rules that are like really anti-business, new taxes, things that are just like, oh, they clearly don’t want us here. We should leave. And yet there’s 11 people on that board. I think probably seven of them are really anti-business and four more moderate and reasonably pro-business appreciate that we employ lots of people in the city and, and pay lots of taxes. So there’s seven seats and, you only need a majority or some form of majority, seven elections, each of which is decided by a couple hundred votes, We are home to some of the greatest technology platforms in the world with literally billions of users. Like we’ve managed to sign up a billion users from your website and you can’t get a hundred people to vote in an election. Like what is going on? Why are we so disengaged? I don’t have a good answer for it, I think you’ll probably start to see people wake up take action and like, look it’s, I believe deeply in democracy, but part of the democratic process is people like taking action and getting people getting out to vote. Tamara Winter: And, you know, as you look across whether it’s shipping, Flexport, what are you optimistic about? Ryan Petersen: Well, you know, it’s, you have to stay optimistic about the ability for individuals to make a difference. I found over and over again in life that if you just take some action, it has a quality of its own that, can pick up the phone and call someone and make something happen, send emails, make stuff happen, and the world just kind of responds. Most recently, like we had this concept on our executive team meetings. Tuesday after the war started, we’re like, hey, we should activate flexport.org on Ukrainian relief. Tamara Winter: For people who don’t know what is flexport.org? Ryan Petersen: Oh, that’s the impact arm of Flexport. We do logistics for humanitarian relief, disaster relief. It has two missions, one is carbon measurement and offsetting and mitigation and two is humanitarian relief. So this is our impact arm. Of course the executive team level we thought of, hey, let’s get flexport.org working on this. flexport.org had already been working on it for like three days. They had already lined up nonprofits and aid agencies and would take action. But we, what we said was, hey, let’s help them raise some money. I mean, there’s only so much that Flexport can do as one company to pay for very expensive humanitarian relief operations. So let’s reach out, texted a couple of people. Next thing I know Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis run this like GoFundMe campaign that’s as of this moment has raised 20 million bucks for us and for airbnb.org to house refugees, us to do logistics for refugee sites. It’s like four days, we did that. And not everyone has our brand and our resources and knows how to text Ashton Kutcher or whatever, but like, you can start on a smaller level and just take some action and help somebody. And especially when you try to help someone else is when the world tries to help you, help you help them. But next thing you know, it’s a virtuous cycle and we’ve seen that with flexport.org. In fact, that was part of the reason that we set it up in a way that we can take donations is it allows us to go out and ask people to get involved, like our customers. We get them to donate products. If we can find a product that our customers make that a refugee camp needs, that’s like, what we do is we match them and we pay for the logistics, or we’ll get a donor to pay for the logistics. But like, by getting that sense of community engagement, everybody’s asked to help. People love to help. Like they want give back, they want to find these opportunities. And so I’m so very optimistic of the power of kind of, I might call it naive optimism that like, believing that you can do something, even if it’s tiny and it has a power of its own to inspire other people to do that. We live in a messed up world, but I don’t think it’s more messed up than it’s been in the past. Like there’s always been wars, since the dawn of humanity, go read the books, like there’s been much worse wars as bad as it is to say, because we’ve never had an iPhone to watch this stuff firsthand the way we do right now. But wars have gone on since the dawn of men and that is not going to change because human nature is not going to change. There’s gonna be wars in the future. And yet humans also, I think if you were to go over right now to Poland, you would see people taking care of each other people housing refugees, people looking after families. And so the bright spot of humanity is not going to change either. And there’s a lot to be optimistic about for sure. It’s like kind of crazy to recognize we all do kind of have these superpowers. It takes a long time to compound so that the world’s given me more resources and connectivity and network to get stuff done, but I think we all have that superpower a bit. And the more you use it, the more it compounds, and becomes more powerful. Like I have a couple of friends who are I might call them like obsessive phone users on like the old school, like call people. And these people have superpowers that would, you would not believe. Like the willingness, I don’t have this, but if you had it, the willingness to make 20 to a hundred phone calls per day, if you make a hundred phone calls per day in 10 years, you’ll be a billionaire. I’m certain of it. One of them called me last night. We’re flying all these goods over to Ukraine and he’s trying to get me to fill the planes full of refugees coming back. And I’m like, that’s a great idea. They’re passenger planes. So there’s empty seats. We could do that, but they need visas to come into the United States. He’s like, yeah, you’re right. Okay. And he like patches me through and calls this like world famous venture capitalist while I’m on the line, gets him on the phone, is like, “Hey, can you help us get visas for refugees coming to the country?” He’s like, “I don’t know why you would think that I could help you with that. But like, let me see, I’ll email the government,” and like next thing, you know, like emailing senators and like I have no idea if that’ll happen or not, probably not, but like I’ve seen crazier plans work and it’s just like the willingness, energy to go try stuff, like make it work. And then you keep trying it and it compounds so, a bit like that. With my kind of port tour tweet or, you know, I’ve just been trying stuff like this for a long time and finding out like, oh wow. It can, like, you can actually have a big impact out there if you, if you’re willing to look stupid sometimes and just go for it. Tamara Winter: So that was Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport. I don’t think there’s a lot more to say after that other than maybe we should all be making a few more phone calls? In the meantime, I hope you will join us for the next episode of Beneath the Surface. We’ll be looking at a type of infrastructure that has acutely felt the impacts of COVID-era supply chain disruptions: housing. We’ll travel to London and visit with a Haredi Jewish community that has fought to upzone their houses so they can have room for their large families.

I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Ben Southwood: It’s March the 15th. Half past one in the afternoon and I’m standing on a residential street in South Tottenham, which is in Haringey, a borough of North London. Tamara Winter: That’s my colleague, Ben Southwood. He’s out on the streets of London to look at houses. Ben Southwood: So the buildings we have here are two-story terraced Victorian and Edwardian homes. I can see many of them have cornices under their eaves or bay windows, gables… Tamara Winter: And he’s looking at these houses here because many of them are beginning to change. Ben Southwood: This residential street’s not quite like every residential street in the country because in addition to its normal two-story Victorian terraced homes, there are additional extensions that have been put on many of these houses. They have been built directly upwards, completely in keeping with the existing Victorian facade. In fact, I’m standing directly opposite an extension going on right now. Tamara Winter: Victorian houses in the UK were built during the reign of Queen Victoria from 1837 to 1901. People from across the country flocked to London just as the industrial revolution was picking up speed. From 1811 to 1851, the population of Greater London doubled, half of the country’s population called the city home. A lot of new housing was needed and fast. And today, many of these Victorian houses are still in use. But now, London faces a new housing crisis: unaffordable rents, overcrowded conditions, and the dream of home ownership drifting further away from the city’s young people. London isn’t alone here. A similar story is happening around the world in cities large and small. However, on that quiet residential street in South Tottenham, the story behind those extensions offers a lesson for those tackling the global housing crisis. Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. In our previous episode, we looked at supply chains: the movement of materials and products from country to country and a delicate dance that makes up the global economy. Today, we’re looking at a component of infrastructure that by its very nature doesn’t move: housing. The issues around housing are diverse and wide ranging. Whether the locality in question is a small town or global metropolis, every place has its own unique challenges. Still, once you dig a little deeper, you start to see some common threads. In this episode, we’ll explore why housing prices have risen dramatically in so many places and how individual neighborhoods, like South Tottenham in London, can address these challenges. For most of human history, people lived in rural areas. But over the last two centuries, cities around the world have seen explosive growth. The UN estimates that 2007 was the first year that most people lived in urban areas and the urban population is expected to double by 2050. This means that cities are having to adapt in unprecedented ways. How do we deliver food and other goods? How do we move through and between cities? And where are all of these new urban dwellers going to live? Because right now, the increase in population is leading to a housing shortage. The supply of homes in most cities has not kept up with the demand, unless supply means prices naturally go up. Archived audio: Housing prices are continuing to surge across… Archived audio: We’ve seen house prices go up steadily by several thousand… Archived audio: Housing prices in Ireland rising by a hundred euro a day. Archived audio: Housing costs taking a bigger bite out of your paycheck and it doesn’t seem to be any relief in sight. Emily Hamilton: I would say that affordability in US cities is the biggest challenge right now. Tamara Winter: This is Emily Hamilton. She was at the top of my list of people I wanted to talk to for this episode on housing. Emily Hamilton: I’m a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Tamara Winter: She says the most relevant housing challenge across the country and really across the world is affordability. Emily Hamilton: Several decades ago, urban policy makers were much more concerned about having too many residents leaving cities and issues like vacancy and crime were much more relevant than affordability. But today, as cities have become job centers once again and are generally the location where the highest paying jobs in the US are located, it’s become much more of a question of how to make space for everyone who would like to live in cities and be able to access those job markets at prices that are affordable to them. And in many parts of the world, that holds true as well, particularly English speaking parts of the world, like the UK and Canada, are facing very similar affordability challenges to the US. Tamara Winter: I’ll admit that I’m a statistic on this trend as well. Since graduating from college in 2017, I’ve lived in some of the most expensive cities in the US: Washington DC, San Francisco, and now, New York. From 1980 to 2020, housing prices in the New York metropolitan area have gone up 700%, more than double wage growth during that same period. In other words, an apartment that sold for $200,000 in 1980 would’ve sold for $1.4 million in 2020. In San Francisco, house prices went up over 900%, and cities outside the US have seen equally dramatic numbers. Ireland saw prices rise by about 800% driven primarily by Dublin. Prices in Sydney, Australia were up almost 1,500%. And in London, the average home price in 1980 was about 25,000 pounds. In 2020, the average price was about 490,000 pounds, a nearly 2,000% increase. Ben Southwood: Well, the UK, and the UK isn’t alone here, has a shortage of housing around its most successful, big cities. Tamara Winter: That’s my colleague, Ben Southwood, again. He’s currently an editor for the online magazine, Works in Progress, but he’s been studying housing for a long time. Ben Southwood: I worked in housing policy for much of the last five years, including at Create Streets, Policy Exchange, and the Adam Smith Institute. I’m obsessed with housing. In the morning, I wake up thinking, "How are we going to solve the housing problems in the UK today?" And I go to bed in the evening, also, still thinking about how are we going to solve the problems in the UK has with housing. And this shortage of housing has led to massive increases in the price of that housing either to buy or to rent and also big shortages and long waiting lists for government-provided housing. Tamara Winter: Ben is always thinking about unique solutions to the housing crisis. So when he came across a series of interesting building renovations happening in North London, he had to investigate. Ben Southwood: Most of the time in England, when you do upwards extensions on homes, those extensions look very different to the house underneath and often are very ugly. And often, therefore, neighbors oppose them very vociferously. However, this extension, interestingly, was identical to the building underneath. In fact, it looked as if they had cut off the roof, added an identical story, and then plopped the roof back on top again. Tamara Winter: So Ben did what any good researcher would do these days: he took the question to Twitter. Ben Southwood: A councilor from North London, that is someone who had been elected by the local residents to be on the council—council is just the standard form of local government in the UK—replied to our Twitter threads, telling us what happened. Tamara Winter: The councilor revealed that the people of this community had a particular need for these housing extensions because they were Haredi Jews. Archived audio: Two hundred boys and girls waved a greeting to England, land of the free, the advanced guard of the first 5,000 Jewish and non-Aryan child refugees from Germany will be provided with a temporary home here while arrangements are made for them to immigrate. Tamara Winter: Haredi Jews first established themselves in London in the 1920s. However, it was after the second World War that the area really started to take off as Jewish refugees fled the Holocaust. Haredi Jews tend to be stricter in their practice of Orthodox Judaism than their peers. They adhere to kosher diets, go to synagogue several times a day, and send their children to religious schools. They also observe Shabbat on Saturdays, meaning, they don’t drive or use electricity. All of these cultural factors mean that Haredi Jewish people tend to live in tight knit and compact communities. One area they settled in was Stamford Hill. It’s in a borough of Hackney in North London. Today, it is the largest strictly Orthodox Jewish community in all of Europe. Add to that, the large size of Haredi families and the result has been overcrowded housing conditions. So yet another neighborhood in North London sprung up as a hub for the Haredi community, South Tottenham in the borough of Haringey. By one estimate, the number of Haredi families has increased fivefold in the last several decades. That’s where Ben found himself, investigating housing extensions. Ben Southwood: Hi there. I’m standing in South Tottenham, which is a neighborhood in North London looking around a suburban street. I have two-story Victorian homes. It’s quite quiet. I can see a few people walking down every few minutes. I can see lots of people walking around in Orthodox Jewish clothing. And I’m just about to meet my friend, Mark, at his house. Tamara Winter: I talked with Ben after his trip to hear more about what he learned. Ben Southwood: The local community is Haredi Jewish. Most of them are also Hasidic, which means they have particular ways of dressing, and particular religious rights, and so on. And I met with three leaders in the Haredi community in North London: Mark Groskopf, Shmuel Davidson, and Motty Pinter. Mark Groskopf: My name is Mark Groskopf and I’m from the Jewish Tottenham community. Ben Southwood: Mark is a family man with nine children, one of whom has left the house. Shmuel Davidson: I’m Shmuel Davidson. I’m from the Tottenham Jewish association. I’m also a deputy on the board of deputies and being a community activist here in the area, where I’ve lived all my life. And I thrive to build this area. Ben Southwood: Shmuel is a man who’s very much in demand. During our interview, he had to leave to take phone calls about five times constantly responding to community’s desires and needs. Motty Pinter: My name is Motty Pinter. I work for Chinuch UK, which is the representative body for 80 Haredi schools across the country. I also work for Agudas Israel Housing Association. Ben Southwood: Motty is the extremely energetic leader of the Hackney community. Motty Pinter: We liaise with the council and we do a lot of work with the council. So any issues, they’ll come in to try to understand the Jewish community and see what the needs are. Ben Southwood: This community has lots of kids on average. One of the stats said their average number of children was six. Motty Pinter: In Hackney, 8.1% of the population is Haredi. But when you look at the children population, you have 25.9% of the children population in Hackney is Haredi. When you drill that down to two to five-year-olds, you have over 30% of children, which are Haredi now. So what you figure is how many households. Ben Southwood: So all of these families having six children, the houses just weren’t built for them. Most communities, if they get overcrowded, decide to move out to the suburbs where land is cheaper, rather than staying in central London where land is more expensive. However, the Haredi Jewish community were not willing to do this because all of their cultural amenities are in one place. Shmuel Davidson: I can’t just move randomly to another borough where I don’t have a synagogue, I don’t have a kosher shop, I don’t have schools. My daily life is going synagogue. It’s just part of my daily routine. We pray three times a day. Going to the synagogue is just what we do. We can’t just move random everywhere. We don’t have a synagogue. It’s not, we just don’t have a life. My whole life, my whole family life will just be completely not there. Take for example, weekend Shabbat, I don’t use public transport. We have to walk. So I need a synagogue within walking distance. I need kosher food. I can’t just go to the local grocery store and find food there. There’s no kosher food there. I need to be able to go shopping on a daily basis. I need a bakery. I need a kosher bakery. I need a butcher. I need a kosher butcher. I need a school for my children. My children could go to non-Jewish school, however, culturally inappropriate. Yes, they will be educated nationally, the proper way, as education goes, however, the cultural appropriate education, the religious education, they will not get and they won’t feel comfortable there. I won’t feel comfortable. Shmuel Davidson: This is part of my daily life, my daily infrastructure. So we need to be living in an area where we have the community infrastructure, the synagogues, the shops, the schools, everything we need as a community and live our lives. Ben Southwood: So all of these things make it very difficult for the Haredi community to spread out. They need to be near one another and they have a very vibrant cultural life as well, which is another reason why they would like to be near, with one another as well. All of these things meant they weren’t willing to move out. So instead of moving out, the Haredi Jewish community decided, "Well, should we buy more of the houses in the neighborhood and spread out in each direction?" Well, firstly, it’s very expensive. It might cost them 500,000 pounds to buy the next door neighbor’s house. Secondly, that takes houses off the market and that means other people can’t live there. And finally, there just aren’t enough houses to go round. Tamara Winter: The housing challenges the Haredi community face are just one example. Any neighborhood can grow beyond its limits because of high birth rates, increased immigration, or simply because it’s a newly desirable place to live, but the Haredi community represents this perfect storm of housing crisis. They have on average eight people in their families. They need to be within walking distance of certain shops and community services, making it really hard to relocate. And the area where they live is way too expensive to buy any neighboring homes. If they can work their way through a housing crisis, shouldn’t it be doable anywhere? Stuck in the situation where they needed more space, some Haredi families decided to just start modifying their homes. But because of housing regulations in the UK, that’s easier said than done. Ben explains. Ben Southwood: So in the UK, we have something called planning, which is what Americans call zoning. But the difference between planning and zoning is that zoning is usually rules-based, so there are a bunch of rules that say what you can build and where, and then developers have to follow those rules. Planning in the UK is discretion-based, so every individual house, if you want to extend that house by adding a story or putting a different window on it or something like that, you have to apply to the local government and say, "Please, can I do this?" There are almost no developments that you can do without a specific permit with the council, which is the local government, going through the details of that permit, and councils look through every application bit by bit. And so it makes it very uncertain, very costly to pursue development because it’s uncertain whether you’re going to get permission or not. Some of them were building up in the maximum way they were allowed under the current rules or even pushing the rules to the limit. Building ugly box dormers is what they call them: boxes. And neighbors were objecting to these because they were unsightly and they were ruining the original heritage of the Victorian buildings, but they needed the space. So there was this conundrum where they wanted space, but the existing ways of delivering space were insufficient and ugly. Tamara Winter: Here’s Shmuel Davidson. Shmuel Davidson: There was no basic guidelines on what the rights, what the wrongs were. People were trying all sorts of things and it was just causing all sorts of problems for planning, enforcement, and it was just getting nowhere. And it got to the point where the community and the local authority really became heads up together and the whole thing. Ben Southwood: So they petitioned the council and said, "Look, can we build upwards?" Tamara Winter: Mark Groskopf again. Mark Groskopf: And Shmuel and I was going backwards and forwards saying, "Look, let’s come up with a solution." And it was actually after sitting, going backwards and forward, they turned their around and said, "Look, you know what? These actual lofts are ugly. Let’s come up with a new plan." We want a space, they wanted looks. Ben Southwood: Working with the council, the community came up with the idea of extending the buildings upwards in a way that was consistent with their existing style so that the street looked like it had just been originally built as a Victorian three-story street. Basically, you take off the roof, you add in an extra story that looks just like the one underneath and then you put the roof back on. So it just looks like the original building, but stretched upwards. It can get four or five in some cases, six bedrooms added on top. Tamara Winter: And over the years, the community began to make some progress working with the local council. Here’s Motty Pinter. Motty Pinter: They would put forward the most recent update, people would be able to argue over it or say their opinions. They would put things down on the table and say, "These are ideas that the architects have raised." And then people around the room would be able to say, "Yeah, but this won’t work here or it will work here." Tamara Winter: The council in Haringey was surprisingly open to the Haredi community’s ideas, but there was still some opposition. Motty Pinter: We heard different views from different people. Some of those have been extremely challenging. For some people, they see this as something new and they’re concerned how it’s going to look and how it’s going to end up. Shmuel Davidson: In this area, we had actually people, residents who worked silently against it. However, once we came about the design, with the concept, with the idea, working endlessly with the local authority, with both the politicians and the officers, together with community. And with the product we were going to deliver, I think all around, the opponents, very nice, but they saw the benefits just outweighed the opponents a million times. Ben Southwood: It still took years and years of work from the community to get the design code put through and make it so that if they made a planning application to the council, the council was very likely to say, "Yes, as long as it stayed within the rules they had set out in advance." Motty Pinter: I think once this is actually introduced and it’s introduced more widely, I think a lot of those fears won’t be there anymore. I think it’s just people being concerned about what is going to happen, but when it actually happens, they’re going to see a lot of benefit. Shmuel Davidson: When I grew up here, the concept of building extensions, those days was virtually nonexistent. And I see families today who have built like what we’re standing in front of now, which… Ben Southwood: There’s one going on right now as we speak. Shmuel Davidson: Right. I was going to say that it’s going up right now, which has just made a complete life changer, a life changer to the area, a life changer to the families. The design, it just fits into a beautifully Victorian side of the houses. It doesn’t look odd. It doesn’t stand out. The quality gives to the family, to the people. And if you just go around the area, just see the development, which has gone on here, which has been achieved by this magnificent idea, which I think we’re unique for the country, I think. Ben Southwood: Yeah. Shmuel Davidson: And it’s absolutely amazing. I just hope others will just copy us and do that because as there’s a housing crisis generally across everywhere, and we know there’s just no housing. Our achievement was the product which we have, which we see today. And this is a phenomenal product and it’s a product of community coalition, a product of working with the local politicians, a product working with the local offices, a product working with local residents, consultations, perseverance, nonstop, and knowing where your end goal is going to be and really go for it. Never drop out, never give up. Because eventually, if that’s what you want to get achieved, I want to get there, you’ll get there. Tamara Winter: What Mark, Shmuel, Motty and the rest of the Haredi community were able to make happen in South Tottenham is ultimately a success story. And the numbers would suggest that this success should be replicable. Haredi families have, on average, around six children. The birth rate in England and Wales in 2020 was 1.58 children per woman, a much smaller number. So if the Haredi community can create abundant housing with such a high population growth rate, certainly, it could be done across the larger UK population. But remember that it didn’t just magically happen, it took perseverance and patience, and working within the system to make progress. But why can’t the system be more accommodating to encourage more housing in the first place? Why does it take so much effort to build housing, something that London desperately needs? John Myers: What we see if we look at traditional zoning in places like England is that they were never designed to streamline that sort of process. They were never designed to solve those political challenges. I mean, zoning was essentially designed to stop change in many places. Tamara Winter: This is John Myers. He’s working at the forefront of pushing for housing reform in the UK. John Myers: We shouldn’t be surprised that we’re not getting plentiful housing in areas with zoning, because it was never designed to allow the densification that we used to see historically over centuries in cities, and which led to much loved urbanism that you see in historic housing cities in Europe today. Tamara Winter: His work goes back to 2014. John read an article that made him realize just how upside down the housing market truly was. John Myers: It explained that the total market price of housing in the UK was three times more than what it would cost to rebuild all of that housing at today’s prices from scratch. And so that to me was the biggest distortion I’ve ever seen in any market or industry anywhere. It’s just an eye watering shortage. And it tells you that there’s something really wrong there. It means that the reason why housing is so expensive in London is not because there’s some shortage of land or because we have a brick shortage, it’s because you’re simply not allowed to build more even when it would be enormously economically beneficial to do so. And that was just the most broken thing I’ve ever seen. Tamara Winter: John’s organization is called YIMBY Alliance, which stands for: Yes, in My Backyard. It’s a counter to NIMBY or Not in My Backyard. The NIMBY acronym was born from neighborhoods that didn’t want the downsides of new housing near them. Understandably, there are plenty of reasons to not want certain projects in your neighborhood. After all, who wants to live next to a coal power plant or a garbage dump? But when it comes to building housing, the effects are generally felt very locally: things like construction noise and additional traffic. And so the idea behind John’s YIMBY movement is that the collective economic and social benefits of allowing new developments will outweigh any short-term side effects. And John’s proposal is to leave the decision to build denser housing to the people who live on the street, where the housing will actually be built. It’s a proposal he calls ‘street votes.’ John Myers: If somebody turns a single family home on your street into say townhouses or into low rise, apartment blocks, that mainly only affects the other people on your street, especially if effects on parking and other traffic congestion are controlled carefully. So there’s no real reason why, if the broad majority, the overwhelming majority of people on your street, are happy for those sorts of developments to happen to gracefully allow single family homes to be turned into townhouses or even something a bit more ambitious. There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be able to choose to allow that so long as the neighbors on other streets are protected. Tamara Winter: Street votes certainly sounds like a winning scenario for neighborhoods with each individual voter deciding for themselves if they’d like to capture the benefits of new developments. But of course, it’s not always easy for entire neighborhoods to come together. In South Tottenham, for example, the neighbors were opposed to changing the aesthetic of the old homes there. They ultimately found a solution, but surely, looks can’t be the only thing holding back new housing. Is there more behind this resistance to change? Tamara Winter: Thank you. I think we’re good. Yeah? Ronan Lyons: Yep. And my phone has just gone... yeah, no, it’s still working away there. Tamara Winter: Hello! Yes, I’m so excited about this. I got in touch with Ronan Lyons. Ronan Lyons: My name is Ronan Lyons. I’m an associate professor in Economics at Trinity College Dublin. Tamara Winter: Ronan is a bit of a housing guru in Ireland. Ronan Lyons: People in Ireland might also know me because I work on something called the daft reports. Daft is like Zillow or the Right Move in Ireland. It’s like a major property portal. Once a quarter or twice a quarter, one for rental and one for sale, I do housing market analysis. So with the never dull Irish housing market, there’s always something to talk about. Tamara Winter: In Ireland, we see the same story playing out as in so many other countries. Ronan Lyons: In short, we have a situation in Ireland where we have not enough homes getting built for the number of new households that would or should form. I do think Ireland is a good microcosm of a lot of the issues that have arisen in many... especially high income countries over the last 30, 40 years. Tamara Winter: It turns out, the history of these rules are part of the reason it’s so hard to change housing policy. Ronan Lyons: What had happened between the ’40s and the ’70s in the United States is there had been significant attempts to boost the home ownership rate. What it meant was that the typical district that’s voting people in in the US or indeed in a European country, now has a majority of homeowners and their interests may differ from other households. That was kind of a key turning point. Because once people were aware of that, they were able to co-opt all sorts of reasoning, some of it environmental or quality controls or whatever, and use those as fronts for what is effectively preserving the value of the biggest thing on their balance sheet. Tamara Winter: And so when politicians are trying to appeal to voters, anything that will affect the value of their homes can get politically dicey. Ronan Lyons: When they put in land use restrictions, they’re doing so because they get the elected to do so. People who come along, they won’t phrase it like this, "I will preserve the value of your home by limiting the construction of new homes." That is a vote winner, right? Whatever way, you’ve got to indicate that you’ll do that without saying, "And I’m going to price that new households." That’s a vote winner. If you look at Ireland, if you look at lots of European countries, if you look at the US, we have ended up with a system where the incumbents, the people who are there already and secured their housing, have disproportionate power over new housing supply. Tamara Winter: Despite this individual opposition, the benefits of growth and new housing are widespread throughout society. There’s better investment in infrastructure, attracting new businesses, creating more jobs. And of course, keeping house prices affordable. And with John Myers’ street votes plan, he believes that there will be enough people who see through the short-term to the larger upside. And he’s hopeful because he’s seen this localized effort work outside the UK. First, in Israel. John Myers: The most recent example that comes to mind is in Tel Aviv where the government proposed the means for residents to be allowed to decide if they wanted to redevelop their own apartment block, either extend it or to replace it with an entire new block with more apartments in it. That accounted for about 35% of the new homes in Tel Aviv in 2020. It’s an astonishing increase. Tamara Winter: Second, in South Korea in the 1990s. John Myers: The government allowed areas of single story homes to vote collectively if they wanted to give themselves permission to redevelop that whole area. And again, that accounted for the majority, I think, of the new condos built in Seoul for a portion of the 1990s. Tamara Winter: Lastly, a city in my home state: Houston, Texas John Myers: Houston, as you know, doesn’t have zoning in the traditional sense of the term, but it does have what are called minimum lot size requirements. And that says that if you want to build a new home, you have to have a piece of land which is at least a certain size. Those sizes were quite big. And the city of Houston wanted to reduce that size to allow more homes to be built in Houston, to keep Houston affordable for renters. There was a fair amount of political resistance from people living in areas of single family homes with large lot areas. And so in order to overcome that pushback, they decided to allow effectively an opt-out from the change that they were proposing and that let them get that change through, and you see the results in Houston where there’s a lot of new housing being constructed as a result of that. There are a lot of homeowners who are probably better off because their plot can now be used for more housing than it was before. And yet, the people who are most resistant to change have been able to opt out. And so this principle of giving flexibility on a very small level can make it much more politically palatable to engineer change and to get more housing. If you offer families a way to literally change their lives, the way to guarantee housing for their children or their grandchildren, a way to make it much easier to live, and all they have to do is vote for graceful change, which is completely consistent with what we’ve seen in cities over centuries, I have to believe that a small amount of people will do that. And that’s very consistent with what we’ve seen in Tel Aviv. It’s consistent with what happened in Seoul. And it’s also consistent with the fact that most of Houston didn’t opt out of these changes. Tamara Winter: And as John points out, the needle doesn’t have to move that much to see real change. John Myers: We don’t actually need to upzone the entire London or the entire of the Bay Area in order to get vastly amounts, more housing. So in London, if you just took 3, 4, 5% of the lowest density areas, you would engineer a step change. You would more than double the supply of housing in London. Tamara Winter: With all of these examples, John feels optimistic that street votes can gain some real political momentum in the UK. John Myers: We’ve seen quite a fair amount of traction in England with that. We’ve been lucky enough to find an incredible coalition that has supported these sorts of ideas, because it’s ultimately not very controversial. There aren’t really that many people who disagree with the proposition. But if the people on the street want to see more development, they should be allowed to permit it. Motty Pinter: I want to put it on pause for a second? Ben Southwood: That’s okay. But it’s fine to get extra… Motty Pinter: I have a tendency to talk too much. You don’t stop me, then.. Tamara Winter: Finally, back in South Tottenham, Ben wrapped up his interview with Mark, Shmuel, and Motty. By one estimate, the Haredi community has added a thousand extra bedrooms using their method of building extensions. Ben Southwood: Okay. So let’s have a little look around. Tamara Winter: And Mark himself had recently constructed a loft conversion onto his own Victorian house. Mark Groskopf: It was built about six months ago. So I was living in a bedroom, seven kids living in one bedroom, three bunk beds and a mattress on the floor. Ben Southwood: Wow. Mark Groskopf: That’s how the family was living. Tamara Winter: So before Ben left, Mark gave him a tour of the house. Mark Groskopf: You’ve come into the hallway, you’ve got a dining room. So it’s quite a big dining room which we’ll extend it slightly. And then… Ben Southwood: Mark has a very large dining room, presumably to fit his nine children, wife, and self in having dinner at the same time. Mark Groskopf: Let’s go upstairs. Ben Southwood: And we go upstairs and Mark shows me what the house originally looked like. There were two bedrooms and two bathrooms. In one of the bedrooms was the master bedroom and the other bedroom was seven of his children. Mark Groskopf: This is where we had three bunk beds and a mattress on the floor. We got two bunk beds. Ben Southwood: Now, there’s only two children in that original seven-children bedroom. And the other children are all spread across different bedrooms. Mark Groskopf: And we got another floor. Ben Southwood: And he’s added four bedrooms on the top floor. Mark Groskopf: And then you’ve got a front room over here, as you can see how big it is. Ben Southwood: Wow. Imagine. So you were going from that room where there were six of them in there. Mark Groskopf: Yeah. Ben Southwood: And then now, they’ve got a huge two-bedroom. Mark Groskopf: That’s correct. Ben Southwood: He says that this has made a huge difference to his children’s experience of school, to the togetherness, everyone’s getting along better. It really is striking how one-and-a-half extra stories can make such a large difference to how much space there is to go around when there’s seven children’s crammed into one bedroom, it must be much harder to have lots of the things that you want as a child. Mark Groskopf: And then we go up to the next floor. And what I’ve done is in this area over here, where the front of the house goes alone, we call it the apex. We’ve left over there and it’s a center room. We use it as a center room. Ben Southwood: Ah. Mark Groskopf: So you’ve got the toys down over there. Ben Southwood: Yeah. Mark Groskopf: And then the kids go inside over there and relax and enjoy themselves over there. Ben Southwood: Mark’s family looks after kids with special needs from the community. Mark Groskopf: Every weekend, we bring kids in from the other families to give the parents a rest… Ben Southwood: In the low ceiling part, he put in a sensory room with interesting lights and sounds and so on for kids to go in. And apparently, they really like it. Wow. Well, my mother would love to meet you then because she does a lot of work. It’s amazing how much they’ve managed to add how many... they’ve got extra bedrooms. They make all the space, they’ve got extra bathrooms, and this is all just on the existing plot.

Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides, where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to last week’s episode of this podcast, you heard excerpts from my interview with Dr. Ronan Lyons. He’s an associate professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin and the director of Trinity Research and Social Sciences, an interdisciplinary research initiative that brings together scholars from across the university. In our conversation, he offers insights into the complexities of housing broadly and explains why the challenges plaguing housing markets are especially acute in Ireland. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Dr. Ronan Lyons. Tamara Winter: Hello. Yes, I’m so excited about this. Okay. So the first thing I’m just going to have you do is introduce yourself and your academic affiliations, if you will. Ronan Lyons: Sure. So my name is Ronan Lyons. I’m an associate professor in economics at Trinity College Dublin, where I’m also the director of a center called Trinity Research and Social Sciences which is like a collection of a few hundred research active social scientists across all disciplines in the social sciences here in Trinity and people in Ireland might also know me because I work on something called the Daft Reports. Daft.ie is like the Zillow or the Rightmove in Ireland. It’s like a major property portal and once a quarter or twice a quarter, once for a rental and one for sale, I do housing market analysis. So with the never dull Irish housing market, there’s always something to talk about. Tamara Winter: So Ronan, well, that’s actually really helpful. I’m curious about your journey into housing. How did that become a topic of interest for you? And I’m also curious, if I may, about your personal housing situation, because you have...it’s three children, is that right? Ronan Lyons: That’s right. Three boys, six and under, so a busy household. So I actually studied as an undergrad at Trinity and I did economics and political science. And afterwards, as many people find themselves, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do and I was in the lucky position that I was offered a scholarship to stay at Trinity. And I did some research in economic history, the history of trade and globalization, which I found really interesting, but then you’re like, "Well, I’ve picked one thing and I fall into one thing, what else do I want to do?" So I worked in policy making for a while. I worked for the National Competitiveness Council in Ireland. So Ireland as a small open economy is really dependent on its ability to trade internationally. So the Competitiveness Council advises the prime minister and the cabinet on where Ireland is doing well or badly. So that gave me a, I suppose, a taste of policy analysis, policy advice, and policy making and how policy happens. And at the same time, a friend of mine had set up daft.ie, the Irish property portal when he was in high school. And after I finished my degree, he came to me and he said, "Could we do a report where we look at the...just the rental sector in Ireland and how it’s performing?" Because there weren’t...it wasn’t the same, I suppose, measurement of housing market conditions at the time. So I accidentally ended up in housing but after working in...I was doing this as a side gig and I was working for the Competitiveness Council and I did a bit of work for IBM as part of their policy consulting. And I was moving around. So I had done research, I’d done policy making, I did private sector, but I realized that actually the thing I really enjoyed was research. So I had gone wandering around, but I came full circle. And in some ways you have to do that, right? You have to go and, or somebody like me has to do that. I need to know what I’m not doing to know that I’ve made the right choice, but in 2009, then I started at Oxford, a doctorate there looking at the Irish housing bubble and crash. And I finished 2013 and I was lucky enough that Trinity was hiring at the time. So I started in the department of economics then and I’ve kept those economic history or long run economic development as one hat and housing is another hat. And I see them as related because when you look at housing and you look at real estate, if you think about the immobility of a home or a building, when you buy it, you’re buying the opportunity associated with the location. And unlike a worker can move and financial capital can move and some workers are more or less mobile, that’s certainly true, but a dwelling isn’t. So the idea of using housing and using land to tell us something about what is good or bad about a location or what people are more or less confident about for me, that’s the heart of why real estate and why housing is really interesting in addition to the very obvious thing that we all need somewhere to live, right? And if...as we’ll presumably get onto, if we don’t have enough places to live, then all sorts of problems arise from that. Tamara Winter: That’s actually exactly the next question. It’s so funny as we’ve done some of these interviews, one of the producers are working with was like, "Tammy, I think you take for granted the idea that people just know what’s going on with housing, what the problem even is, if there is one." So I might actually ask you that question as, and maybe you can both couch it in Ireland, this is very much an issue across the world. What is the basic challenge with housing right now? Whether it’s affordability, not having enough homes, et cetera. Can you explain it to me like I’m five? Ronan Lyons: I’ll do my best. And I do think Ireland is a good microcosm of a lot of the issues that have arisen in many, especially high income countries over the last 30, 40 years. In short, we have a situation in Ireland where we have not enough homes getting built for the number of new households that would or should form. And some of that is population growth. And Ireland is I think, unusual in Europe in that it will have faster population growth this century than last century. And some of that’s the long shadow of, there was a famine in the 1840s and that’s why there’s such a large Irish-American community and there’s also a large Irish community in Britain as well. And that has those deep historical roots, but since the 1980s and 1990s, Ireland has had a successful business model where it’s a gateway to the single European market. And as a result of that, it has had all sorts of growing pains. As in incomes have gone up, population has gone up, Ireland has gone from net emigration to net immigration and all of those are signs of success, but unless you scale up the infrastructure as well, then you will come up with all sorts of congestion challenges. And the timing was fortuitous for things like road infrastructure, the European Union gave Ireland money to help build a motorway network. It didn’t have any highways 30 years ago, but in relation to housing, that’s a much more local issue and like many places, we have for various reasons, many of which are worthy, made it more difficult to build a home. So in addition to the population angle, we also have something that’s common in other countries as well but I think Ireland is particularly acute in this, changing demographics. So if you think of countries on a journey from having households of four or five persons on average to households having one or two persons on average, and some cases, maybe three, but you see, average household size is going from four to two, even with the same population, you need twice as many homes, but the homes are different. And on top of that, if you go from rural to urban in the same a hundred year transition, you are going from larger rural homes to smaller urban homes. And that’s a challenge of location and it’s a challenge of mix, but it’s also a challenge of viability because not everything scales down, you need plumbing, you need a bathroom and a shower and a toilet and a kitchen, regardless of how many people you have in the home. You need some basic infrastructure in there. So providing a home for one person is not a quarter of the cost of providing one home for four people. And I think that’s a big challenge that Ireland has struggled with and I think other countries struggled with as well, it’s perhaps less obvious than the population increase bit but certainly in Ireland’s case, providing urban housing for smaller households is not something the country is good at and it’s even a struggle to get politicians and policy makers to recognize the scale of that need. Tamara Winter: Could you explain basically what happens when the housing stock doesn’t match population growth or immigration? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. So actually part of my doctorate, one of the main chapters was trying to come up with what you might think of as a house price equation. What happens, house prices or housing prices if income goes up, if supply goes up, if credit conditions get tighter or looser, and the credit conditions bit was super important at the time, because Ireland was coming out of a bubble and crash situation. So that was the focus at the time was how much, if nothing else changes and you loosen credit conditions, what happens property prices and sure enough, they go up and tightening them brings them back down again. And a lot of macro credential rules are about trying to level that out, take that channel for amplifying house prices up and down and just really calm it down. So that then leaves you once you at least try and contain those credit conditions, then it leaves you with this battle between supply and fundamental demand rather than credit demand or assets, factors like that. And on the fundamental demand side, you’ve got income per household and you’ve got household size. And those two things in Ireland’s case have been in...household size been going down, right? So you need more households per population or more dwellings per population and incomes have been going up. And this is another tricky bit for policy makers, the richer you get, the more you consume of everything, some things you shift into and some things you shift out of, but you consume on balance more of everything, the richer you get and that includes housing. And going back to that piece of research I did for my thesis, one of the things we were trying to do was take out that bit and say, "Okay, if you hold income constant then you increase supply by 10%, what happens?" And our best estimate was that if you did that exercise, you would lower prices by about 12%. And that’s a fundamental that, again, in many countries, people are questioning, right? Because they see completions going up, more new homes getting built and they see prices of rents going up and they go, "You can’t say to me that if you build more homes, prices will go down because that’s not happening at the moment." And really this gets to the heart of the social science of housing is that that correlation is not about causation, that what’s actually happening here is that homes are getting built because there’s a lot of need. And in Ireland’s case, there’s a need for maybe 40 to 50,000 homes a year and it’s only building 20,000. Now, if you didn’t build those 20,000, rents and sale prices would increase even more. And that’s the tricky bit because it’s very hard to argue with someone who doesn’t, who sees the correlation and doesn’t believe the underlying theory. It’s hard to say to them, "Well, let’s stop building and let’s see how that goes," right? That’s not a viable suggestion because that would make things worse, not better. Tamara Winter: The conversation about housing tends to be so polarized, especially online, but we’re talking about people’s livelihoods, right? I’m Nigerian, my parents immigrated to the US when I was about two months old and thank goodness they found a house in Texas where we grew up but say they had moved to New York, I think the situation would be very different or in Ireland where my grandfather worked for a substantial part of his career. Anyway, I digress. We know that house prices increasing is one of the obvious effects of restricting the supply of housing for whatever reason. But I wonder too, if you could just talk about some of the less well understood effects of restricting the supply of housing. Ronan Lyons: I mean, Ireland’s a good example of...I mean, it’s hidden and people don’t talk about it that much, but I mentioned earlier, Ireland’s really dependent on international investment or at least outwardly focused. Some of it’s indigenous and some of it’s coming from overseas, but it’s about creating economic activity for exports, right? You’re tapping into the European market. But over the last few years, the housing has been so scarce that firms have been holding back on expanding. I mean, think about how wrong that is, right? That you actually could hire an extra 2,000 people and you’re choosing not to, not because you can’t find work for them, but you can’t find housing for them. I’m not saying everywhere suffers from that, but there are, I think lots of places. If you look at New York and Tokyo over the last 50, 60 years, New York and Tokyo are roughly the same size, they have now...since the 60s, they’ve had very different setups in terms of the ability to build new housing. Tokyo is now about twice as big as New York. And people will say, "Well, New York’s big enough already. It doesn’t need to get any bigger," but the point is, and you talk to say the economic geographers, people like Enrico Moretti or whatever, and it’s the geography of where people are productive. And there are certain features about locations that make them productive and that would allow people to choose themselves if they want to move from say one part of the US to another, in order to move into a growing industry. And if housing is stopping that either internally in the US or internationally in the case of Ireland, that’s a real direct cost. I mean, housing is always in everywhere, right? Someone’s shelter, right? It’s their home at nighttime, but housing is seeping into being about livelihoods as well. And whether we are enabling people to have the most fulfilled potential that they can, that if we’re not getting housing, right? That’s for me, one of the...it’s not hidden, but it’s maybe not always highlighted, the cost of not enough housing, but it does seep through everywhere. If you don’t have enough housing... I wow my undergrads with the story that say 20 years ago, I had friends who moved out of their parents’ home in Dublin to rent a property in Dublin while they were in college, because they were just like, "Well, hey, I’m an adult, I’ll go off and I’ll find somewhere to live." That is so far from the possibility now, if you’re a 19 year old student in Dublin, I mean, you just stay at home with your parents. There’s no option. You may even have to commute. If you’re outside Dublin, you may be commuting an hour and a half every way, very early in the morning and very late at night to go to college. And that has a cost too, in terms of all sorts of things that are forgone that I took for granted when I was an undergrad that today’s undergrads can’t do. And I think they’re hidden costs as well in terms of forming people and their opportunities, because those years say between 20 and 25 are so crucial to people who are, say, in the higher education space. They’re so crucial to what happens afterwards. Everything is path dependent. Tamara Winter: Absolutely. I really appreciate that in particular, because I think it’s just poorly understood. Okay. So this is actually not super relevant to the podcast, but I’m personally curious about it. Can you summarize Ireland’s housing bubble and its subsequent crash in 2007? What happened there? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. You will see it given as an example of, well, this is almost like the textbook case of this is what happens when you let markets go wild. And I think that misses a key part of the story. Clearly the global credit gloss in the early 2000s was an important factor, but you have to rewind a little bit. And in the mid, late 1990s policy makers were grappling with this idea that Ireland is growing, Dublin is growing, how are we going to provide new housing? And they came up with this scheme that said, "Let’s regenerate parts of Dublin as Ireland’s biggest city and we’ll allow people to write off construction costs for building new homes." So it started out with this urban renewal thing, and that actually worked quite well. I mean, you had organizations that weren’t particularly familiar with building apartments, they’re used to building houses and then they were building apartments. So there might be other quality issues there that we can come back to. But overall, the goal of getting new housing, where there was long term demand was by and large met and actually rents fell during Ireland’s boom and bubble. So many new rental homes were built that rents were cheaper in 2004, 5, 6 than they were in ’98, ’99, 2000. And that’s fascinating because Irish people forget this because they just remember when the sale prices bit was through the roof. So politicians looked at this and went, "That’s interesting. So if we do this tax relief thing, we get lots of housing. So let’s try it in all the other constituencies where we want to get reelected," right? So they went off and they said, "Rural parts of Ireland, let’s get loads of housing built." And it was a no brainer for a developer because they could...the rental income didn’t have to be from the property they were building somewhere in rural Ireland. It could be from anywhere and it didn’t have to be that year. It could be, at some point over the next number of years. So they could build these properties and either good case scenario, they get someone to live in them, worst case scenario, they don’t, and they still get a lower tax bill and unsurprisingly tens of thousands of homes were built in places where there was no long term need. And at the same time you had this credit bubble, which was pushing up prices in lots of countries, the US, UK, Spain and Ireland was right up there at the fore, incomes were going up, confidence was high, banks were getting into mortgages. We had savings and loans like institutions building societies, but they gave way to the banks and the banks became the main mortgage providers, but they didn’t realize what they were playing with and they were giving people more and more leverage. So you had these two things going on, lots of new homes getting built and prices going up a lot. And then the global gloss stopped. The bubble stopped, the music stopped and then things turned pretty quickly. And the government at the same time decided to end the cost release. They were like, "Hang on, what are we doing here actually? And we should stop these release." So Ireland in around 2007 turned and went from a decade of phenomenal increases in the stock of housing and in prices, and that prices bit that was credit driven, it went the other way and prices fell by about 55% in the space of five years. And that’s like a national average. In some segments, if you’re in one of these places that got lots of extra housing, one of these rural markets, the cost of a smaller home might have fallen by 80%. And even to this day, some of those rural counties that saw the most construction relative to the number of people in those early 2000s years, housing today is still the same cost it was 20 years ago because so much was built. In Dublin, not enough was built even in the bubble years and housing is about a third more expensive now than it was in 2000. It’s certainly, not even 20 years, it went up and down and then up again. But paradoxically for...the narrative in Ireland would be that, "Well supply doesn’t keep prices under control because look what happened in the early 2000s." Paradoxically what happened in the early 2000s, when you take a step back and take out the credit bubble is a stunning endorsement of the idea that more supply makes housing more affordable because if you’re in Leitrim or Longford, which are these rural counties that saw some of the most housing built, housing is really affordable there now compared to Dublin where it’s not. Tamara Winter: And so that’s why in your Works in Progress piece, you talk about the Irish ghost towns that actually aren’t ghost towns or at least weren’t intended to be. It’s so funny because in that answer, you actually answer like the next three questions. Your dissertation at Oxford in it, you detail the various factors that affect home prices in Ireland. Could you share some of those factors? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. What I had in mind here and I guess, I’m slightly different to the standard academic because I had had that experience of seeing how policy makers worked, or at least I’d like to think I’m slightly...everyone does, right? Everyone’s slightly different. But I said, "Okay, there’s a morass of factors that can affect housing prices, but can we distill them down to the three, four, five, six most important ones? And I was lucky that I had a supervisor who sees...I’m in many ways, I’m a product of his way of seeing the world, right? My way of approaching a question like that, I like to think is mine, but really it’s, I’m inheriting a lot of his way of tackling these questions. So you could have 50 factors that drive house prices, but we were trying to come up with this list of the most important, so that we could say to policy makers, "If you’re looking at, if you want to control housing prices, if you want to see what’s going to happen next, these are the most important." And I mentioned household income, right? So if household income goes up or down and that can go up or down for a number of different reasons. One of the reasons household income went up in Ireland, say from the 90s to the 2010s was because more and more women were actively in the labor market. So instead of one income or one and a quarter income, you might have one and a half or two incomes and that will boost household income or unemployment, right? So in aggregate, the higher the unemployment rate, the fewer incomes there are per household, right? On average. So there’s a lot going on in that measure. So household income is one, household size is another. And one of the things that was under the hood at the time, and I’m focusing more on now to try and get the point across to policy makers, is that Ireland going from say a three and a half persons per household to two and three quarters, right? That pushed up prices by between 40 and 50% in the space of three decades or so. And I don’t think that’s appreciated. You’ve the same number of dwellings, but you’ve more and more households even with a similar population. And of course in Ireland’s case population was going up, household size was going down. So there’s an even greater increase in the number of households. And then there’s the supply factor, right? So controlling for all those demand factors, fundamental demand factors, the supply, and there’s the three fundamentals and you’ve got asset factors as well. And one of the asset factors is what’s known in the literature as user cost. So how much does it cost you to hold a property one year to the next? And some of that is they say expected capital gains, right? If you think your property’s going to go up 20% between now and next year, it doesn’t really matter if you have 1% property taxes or your cost of borrowing is 3%, you are going to get...you think you’re going to get this 20% gain. And that was a huge driver of demand. And then the final factor is credit conditions that how much...for a given set of savings, how much is the financial system leveraging you up? And in Ireland, like in many countries, we went from say, 25% deposits in the late 90s to sometimes 5% or 0% deposits in 10 years later. And if you think of that as in and of itself, going from 25% deposit to a 5% deposit, the same savings are going to get stretched at a huge amount more in terms of the mortgage you get given. Now, other factors come in there, but those are the five ones: household income, household size, housing supply, the user cost and credit conditions. And we put numbers beside them and said, "Okay, if you want to think about what drives house prices, an X percent increase in incomes will do this," and so on. Tamara Winter: Was it like multiple regression analysis? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. So in terms of the methods, what we were using were...they’re macro econometric methods. So what you’re trying to do is run regressions where you want to maximize the ability of the data to tell you what’s going on. You don’t want to say, "Well, we’re going to assume people are this risk averse or that," whatever it might be, you want to let the data tell you as much as possible. So it makes sense on a first pass theory level, it makes sense that supply is going to be relevant for the cost of housing and incomes and so on. And you can put them in and see what they tell you. And you can also break it down and say earlier or later which factors are most important. And that was one of the punchlines at the time, which was almost 10 years ago, was that ’95 to 2001 prices increased…house prices increased a lot in Ireland, but it was a mix of lots of different things. As Ireland went from being a declining population country to a rising population, rising income country. ’01 to ’07, it was almost entirely credit conditions, right? Basically nothing else changed. Yes, supply went up, but incomes went up almost one to one to match. So that the...of the, I think it was the 8% increase on average per year in inflation adjusted housing prices, seven and a half percent was coming just from credit conditions. Tamara Winter: A comment and a question. The comment would be, I’ve never heard anybody mention the shrinking of household sizes being a relevant factor in the increasing demand for housing but it seems so obvious when you think about it. So that’s very interesting. The question would be, you mentioned something a few answers ago about the difference between New York and Tokyo, decades ago they had the same population size and now Tokyo is both much larger, but also...I mean, I don’t know how much larger, but also much denser. And I know that that... I know very little about this, but I know that’s related to the differences in how Americans are even extending it, the West tends to treat housing as an investment rather than how Tokyo in Japan tend to treat housing. Could you speak to those differences a little bit? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. And there’s a great author called Bill Fischel who’s written something called Homevoter Hypothesis and more recently had a book called Zoning Rules. And if you read Zoning Rules, he’s an economist himself one, who’s proficient in the law. And he has a good caricature of economists at the start of the book where it’s like an economist assumed that planners are just economically illiterate and stop the building of housing for some reasons due to their own preferences. And it’s like, no planners are responding to the demand for planning that when they put in land use restrictions, they’re doing so because they get reelected to do so, that people who come along and go, I will—but they won’t phrase it like this—I will preserve the value of your home by limiting the construction of new homes. That is a vote winner, right? Whatever way you’ve got to not dog whistle it in but you’ve got to indicate that you’ll do that without saying, "I’m going to price that new households," that’s a vote winner. And I think a lot of it comes from...there’s a website WTF Happened in 1971, right? There’s all these charts that suddenly just change in 1971. And we can think of lots of potential factors in there. But I do think the 1970s, the unexpected inflation in the 1970s, possibly driven by the oil price shocks or a combination of factors, including the oil price shocks in places like the US, opened the eyes of homeowners to the idea that if inflation comes along, your debt stays the same size in nominal terms and your property value goes up. So inflation is bad from a consumption point of view, but if you’re a homeowner, it’s good because the real value of your debt goes down. And we’ve known this, that’s why we had hyperinflation after World War I, countries wanted to get the real size of their debt down, just add a few extra zeros to your currency and the debt goes away, that kind of thing. But doing it for households in a mass home ownership environment, because of course what had happened between the 40s and the 70s in the United States is there had been significant attempts to boost the home ownership rate for potentially very good reasons. But what it meant was that the typical district that’s voting people in in the US or indeed in a European country now has a majority of homeowners and their interests may differ from other households. And that was a key turning point because once people were aware of that, they were able to co-opt all sorts of reasoning, some of it environmental or quality controls or whatever and use those as fronts for what is effectively preserving the value of the biggest thing on their balance sheet and in some ways they’re entitled to do that. If I own a home and in principle, I could go out there and actively try and minimize the new housing supply to maximize the value of my home. Now, I think that would be incredibly hypocritical of me given what I passionately believe about housing to be doing that. So I try and do the opposite. I try and argue for more housing, even though it’s not in my own interests. And the economists are laughed at for assuming people are always super automatons and rational and so on. But in my case, I’m living proof that that’s not the case, I suppose. But in general, I do think that that switch got flicked in say in the US in the 1970s and it didn’t happen in other places. And that might be because the age structure is different in Japan now, if you increase interest rates, that could be an economic spur to activity, right? Because the age structure of the population, they’re net savers as opposed to net borrowers or there’s different things going on in different countries or it could be just the way the shock is felt. The same shock, but it’s felt in different ways in different countries. But certainly if you look at Ireland, if you look at lots of European countries, if you look at the US, we have ended up with a system where the incumbents, the people who were there already and secured their housing have disproportionate power over new housing supply. Tamara Winter: It actually leads into...and I just have two more questions. The next question, which is, as you look...I find it unfortunate that, and I understand why these debates often get so charged, but I do find it a bit unfortunate and so I wonder as somebody who does support more liberalized zoning, what do you think are the most compelling arguments that opponents of liberalized zoning make? Ronan Lyons: I mean, there are...one relates to quality I think, and one relates to distribution, right? So people who...and I would have...in the Irish housing debate and people can go on Twitter and see, I would say something and you’ll have...there’s a group of people who will argue vehemently that, against say, if I argue for new rental housing in Dublin, because it badly needed, people would say, "No, the rental housing is getting proposed is not adequate." And they’ll say either, for example, either it’s not good enough quality, so we need higher quality standards. Personally, I don’t think that’s true of the housing that’s getting built at the moment. I think I’ve tried to come up with a measure of it. Of course I did, I’m an economist, but I’ve tried to come up with the measure of the quality of housing and I estimate the housing that’s getting built now about 50% higher quality in terms of the input materials than housing about 20 years ago. So I don’t think that’s true, but I’m sympathetic to the argument that if you build poor quality housing, you are creating future problems. So we should be rigorous in terms of housing. Now there’s an opportunity cost, which gets to the distribution point, the higher your minimum standards, the more of the income distribution you’re pricing out. And I estimate that say Dublin city’s minimum standards around 2015 priced at 90% of the income distribution and that’s pointless, right? It’s pointless having minimum standards that only allow 10% of people to enjoy new housing, because what you do is you create segregated markets. So from a distributional point of view, I think new housing shouldn’t be the preserve of the market or shouldn’t be the preserve of the state or whatever, I think we need a holistic approach that says, if you think of it as three groups in the population, you’ve the group that are rich enough based on current standards and prices to afford housing in the market. You have a group that are poor enough based on whatever the standards are for providing social housing, that they qualify for social housing. And then you’ve got a group in the middle who are not rich enough to afford market housing and not poor enough to qualify for supported housing. And really if I were a housing minister or a secretary, I mean, that is your goal. Your goal is to make sure that group doesn’t exist, that they’re either in the market or in the supported housing sector. And for both in order to achieve that, you need both those groups, the market housing segment and the social or supported housing segment to be responsive to underlying need. So that’s an argument where basically social or supported housing is a compliment to market housing. It’s not a substitute and I think that’s one of the...one of my get out of jail cards when some of my critics come along and say, "You’re just like a shield for developers and it’s all about profit for you." I have one guy who likes calling me a money astrologist because I’m an economist or whatever. I’m like, my estimate of housing need is high enough that I think the state should be supporting the construction of maybe 15 to 20,000 homes a year. So I don’t think...I don’t know of any competitor in Ireland’s case that has a higher estimate of socializing than me. I also have a higher estimate of market need, because I believe the underlying need say for one and two person households, as we get older, as we start our families later, all that kind of stuff is adding new housing need, diversity of housing need. So I think on quality and distribution, there are points to be listened to. I’m super reluctant to take into account…I think of this, right. I live in central enough in Dublin, I can see the Guinness tower, right? From my bedroom window. I can look at it and go, "There’s the Guinness Storehouse," which is like one of the most popular tourist attractions in Ireland. Now, it’s not particularly attractive, but suppose it were super attractive and I’m like, "That’s part of my view, right? Across the road, there’s a site that’s going to get redeveloped and they’re going to put in, I think, five or six stories in group of apartments. I think I should be entitled to say, "Well, yes, I don’t think you should build that because I have a lovely view.” Now I think that observation on the new development should be given a weight of close to zero, right? It is effectively irrelevant for society, right, that I have a view of the Guinness Storehouse from my bedroom window. It’s nice for me, I didn’t buy the property because out of the window, I can see the Guinness Storehouse or whatever it might be. I think we need to be a lot more clear about the weight we give to arguments that are effectively arguments to keep housing prices high. Tamara Winter: As you look across Ireland and then maybe more broadly across the world. Are there reasons for optimism on housing? Ronan Lyons: In Ireland, I think there are because things have been so...I mean, things were up and down for different reasons, but things have been so bad for the last 10 years that if you think of...just take the case of Dublin, Dublin is a city of about one and a half million people, about a half a million dwellings and the rental sector is about 150,000 rental dwellings, right? So not quite a third, but not far off. As things stand, they actually recognized this a couple years ago policy makers, they said, "We need to boost the supplier rental accommodation.” We are now in the opposite of the sweet spot. We’re in the eye of the storm at the moment because those plans have been lodged to build about 50,000 new rental homes but very few of them have come on stream. So you’ve people saying, "Look, you changed these rules three years ago," and of course COVID came in and didn’t help. And you changed these rules three years ago and nothing has changed. In fact, rents have gone up. Things are getting worse, not better. And I look and I see about 40 to 50,000 rental homes coming down on stream over the next five or six years. And I say, Dublin is going to be such a better city for having 200,000 rental homes rather than 150,000 rental homes. And yes, the new 50,000 are going to be expensive, but we have made them be expensive because we have high standards. And I know some people will disagree with that but I do believe that that’s true. We have high standards and the new rental accommodation is going to be expensive, reflecting that. So that’s the...I’m a natural born optimist. I see things getting slightly better and I do, and again, in the case of Ireland, I think the things were so bad in providing which you might think of as social or supported housing over the last 20 years. It was a decision in the early 1990s, implicitly, nobody ever stated this, but implicitly, it was let’s stop providing lots of social housing by the state and by lending more and more risky mortgages that we...and the US did the same thing effectively that that will step in, the market will step in for the state. And we know post 2007, that that’s not a reliable way to provide housing for all, but for about 10, 12 years in Ireland’s case, there was not a huge amount of progress. And just in the last 12 months or so, there’s been a bit of progress in terms of cost rental. So Jane Jacobs writes about this in her book about how would you provide housing for all…the Death and Life of Great American Cities. She talks about what we would call cost rental is that, if a third of your income is the most you can spend on housing, how could, what do you do for people for whom that’s not enough to cover the cost in new housing? And you got to top them up to get to that point. And Ireland is introducing a system a bit like that. And I think that’s going to make social housing or non-market housing, more responsive to underlying need. So I’m an optimist for Ireland, even though I could also give you the list of clouds in the horizon or things that I think are wrong, let’s go with optimism. More globally, if I’m an optimist it’s earlier in the pipeline of optimism, it’s hard to point generally. And it’s hard to summarize generally about housing. And there’s a couple of books actually, that I’ve seen coming out recently, one’s called Mass Housing, I think, and it’s trying to synthesize across countries. And actually some of my own work...I’m working on a project that’s funded by the National Science Foundation looking at housing prices in the US since the civil war and trying to measure prices at a city level. And in doing that and in doing the same for Ireland and in doing the same for Canada to contribute to an international, not debate, because I think that sets us up in the wrong, but International evidence base around what’s happening in housing markets now and how it fits into a longer term picture. But I’ve digressed a little bit. The drawing, I suppose, drawing conclusions about the global housing system or even the housing system in the high income world, if I’m optimistic, I think it’s because there’s a lot more people who believe housing to be important to research. And we know so much more than we did 10 years ago, so that’s on the research side, that of optimism. I think that will filter through into the policy side, but I do think that every country is going to have to come up with its own way of wrestling with the, yeah, the promiscuous veto with the power of incumbents and some of it, some countries may not be able to solve that until you’ve...things have got so bad. You’ve got a majority of renters in certain key parts of your country and then the power switches. Tamara Winter: Ronan, that’s all I have. Thank you, so, so, so much.

Archived audio: Is it for real? Oh, it’s for real now. Tamara Winter: It’s New Year’s Eve 2016. Then governor Andrew Cuomo and his wife descend an escalator underneath second avenue in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Behind them, ride a gaggle of men in suits and women in evening gowns. Cuomo flashes a smile to one of the dozens of cameras followed by a thumbs up and a wave. They turn to board a colorfully decorated new subway car emblazoned with the words second avenue. It’s the kind of grandiose ribbon cutting moment that every politician dreams of. Archived audio: We needed to show people that government works and we can still do big things and great things, and we can still get them done. Tamara Winter: But this was no ordinary transit project. It took nearly a century to finish, and it was the most expensive per-mile subway project ever. Welcome to Beneath the Service, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. In our last episode, we looked at rising housing costs. Today we’re looking at what could be considered the other side of the same infrastructure coin, transit. I grew up in a suburb of Dallas, Texas. We have the Dart, or Dallas Area Rapid Transit, but its efficiency and convenience leave a lot to be desired. According to census data compiled by homearea.com, the share of commuters in the Dallas Fort Worth Metro area that use public transit is—1.4%. And that tracks with my experience. Growing up, I would take a train once in a while, but only on special occasions to the Texas state fair or the stockyards in Fort worth. Trains were a special treat, not something that was part of my main transportation diet. By contrast, I moved to New York City in 2021 and the city subway has just become a part of my daily life, as it is to 3.1 million other New Yorkers. And I learned that only a few years before I arrived, a new subway line opened underneath second avenue in Manhattan. It was a rare new addition to one of the largest and oldest subway systems in the world. Phase one of the project was completed in 2017. It is a modest two miles of track and three stations. It runs through the upper east side neighborhood. The price tag was around 4.4 billion dollars, and that’s just one of the four phases of construction. Phase two will extend the line north into East Harlem and is expected to open sometime between 2027 and 2029. The cost of phase two is expected to surpass that of phase one. Phases three and four would extend the line along Manhattan’s East side, all the way to the financial district at the Island’s Southern most point. These phases currently have no funding commitments or timelines. I guess the thing that gets me is that this subway line was first proposed in 1920, over 100 years ago. So, why has it taken so long to construct? Why is it costing so much? And what can we learn about public transit? Not only where the Second Avenue Project got it wrong, but where other places get it right. Sarah Kaufman: In New York city the subway is the lifeblood of the city. Tamara Winter: This is Sarah Kaufman. She’s the Associate Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University Sarah Kaufman: At NYU I do research, I conduct events, and I teach mostly around the topic of transportation and technology. Tamara Winter: She’s also worked at the city’s transit agency itself. Sarah Kaufman: I previously worked at the MTA, which is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority here in New York, which is the organization responsible for New York subways and buses, as well as several bridges, tunnels, and highways. Before COVID the subway was handling about five and a half million people per day. And then we also have the largest bus system in the country. And before COVID, it was handling about 2 million people a day. New York City does not function without its subway and bus systems, because that is how everyone gets around. In a lot of US cities, the only people who take buses or trains are lower income people, but here in New York you could be sitting next to a multimillionaire or someone who is very low income and everyone’s riding it together. It’s a great equalizer. Tamara Winter: Today, the subways might be the city’s lifeblood, but a quarter century before the first trains began running underground, elevated trains rumbled above Manhattan’s busiest avenues. Archival audio: Gleaming skyscrapers are traditional landmarks of New York, but there are other landmarks like the grimy ribbon of steel [inaudible 00:06:37]. Tamara Winter: They were loud, dirty, and choked the city’s street life under a canopy of metal. Archival audio: For 76 years, L trains clattered by carrying people to work and home again. But the old steel skeleton outlived its usefulness. Passengers dwindled, and so the L is being torn down. Tamara Winter: The city began phasing out these elevated trains, known to New Yorkers at the time as the L because the more modern underground subway lines were being built. Well, most of them were being built anyway. Sarah Kaufman: So the first concept for the Second Avenue Subway was published in 1920. And it was just an idea. And the city planned to start construction in the early 1930s, but as you know, the depression hit. And so there was no funding for a new subway line. Once the country recovered... Archival audio: Second Avenue. Miles of new housing need miles of new track. Sarah Kaufman: Different capital project amounts went into repairs and other subway lines and so there wasn’t funding for this project. There were fits and starts over time in the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s based on federal funding and state funding, as well as governance changes for the MTA itself. Archival audio: Much of the transportation future will be hidden below the ground in more than 50 miles of new subways. Soon, there will be a new two track subway that will run the length of Manhattan on Second Avenue, right up to the Bronx. Tamara Winter: The city did actually start construction in the early 1970s. However, New York City soon fell into severe economic and political turmoil, leading to high unemployment and rising crime. Archival audio: New York City Subway System. It has turned into a nightmare for the millions who ride it each day. The reason for the crime wave? The city says it doesn’t have the money to pay for transit police. Tamara Winter: Again, the Second Avenue Subway was put on the back burner. Sarah Kaufman: New York was left with several mini tunnels under Second Avenue, but nothing that connected and nothing that was yet able to have a train because these tunnels were not contiguous. Tamara Winter: The 1980s and ’90s saw the city crawl itself out of the fiscal hole and finally start to bring down the crime rate. In December 2001, just three months after the 9/11 attacks shook the city, research began on the impact of constructing the Second Avenue tunnels to the city and the environment. These impact statements were finished in 2004, and plans were developed for the next two years. Archival audio: One, two, three. Sarah Kaufman: So finally, construction resumed in the 2010s. Archival audio: We’re here today, starting up the tunnel boring machine, which you see behind me for the Second Avenue Subway. This is a tremendously exciting day. Sarah Kaufman: It was seen as a shovel ready project in the 2010s. A lot of it had to do with federal investment because this project was just too large for local or state investment to have completed. And so once there was a real federal commitment to transit, mostly thanks to Obama, the city was able to work on this project. Tamara Winter: That leads us to then Governor Cuomo’s grand opening gala. Unveiling a stretch of track from 63rd street to 96th street underneath Second Avenue. Archival audio: Thank you and God bless you. In a few minutes and we’re going have a great New Year. Thank you. Tamara Winter: So yes, nearly a hundred years later, the Second Avenue subway was eventually built. Well, one of four parts were built. And pre pandemic, the line saw around 200,000 weekday riders. That’s more than the entire Atlanta Rapid Transit System. So sure it’s doing its job, but then there’s the issue of cost. Sarah Kaufman: The Second Avenue subway was the most expensive subway built in the history of the world in mile-per-mile basis. Tamara Winter: The total cost was around $2.6 billion per mile. Sarah Kaufman: There’s a lot of great research done about construction costs in the US being just astronomically high. If you look at the work of Alon Levy... Alon Levy: Okay, I found the sound recorder. My name Alon Levy. Tamara Winter: Alon Levy is a transit researcher. They run the websites, Pedestrian Observations, and the Transit Costs project. Alon’s interest in transit costs started when they were studying for their PhD in New York. Alon Levy: I got an interest in the subway. It’s just a thing that people do in New York, they ride this train. And I saw, okay, this is how this system laid out and started thinking about maybe gaps in the system. What could we edit? What would we change? And somehow this has gone to trying to compare it with a lot of other big systems. And this is when I realized, just through a little bit of Googling, that the construction costs of subway construction in New York, the Second Avenue subway were very high. Tamara Winter: That led them to look at other subway projects. Alon Levy: They checked a bunch of huge global cities. Tamara Winter: Alon found that the global average cost of transit projects was around 400 million dollars per mile. The Second Avenue project was six times that. This led them to start the Transit Costs Project. It’s a website that catalogs the costs of transit projects around the world. Alon Levy: Right now we have a database, it’s something like 600 items. We have close to complete coverage of subways built in the last 20 or 25 years. Tamara Winter: The Second Avenue subway is extreme, both in timeline and cost, but it’s not unusual in the US for transit projects to fall behind schedule and go over budget. According to the Transit Costs Project, transit projects in the US are the sixth most expensive in the world. The countries that are one through five are New Zealand, Hong Kong, Qatar, Singapore and the UK respectively. However, there’s an important caveat to the data here. Digging tunnels and building underground rail, like a subway, make construction much more expensive than simply laying down rail over land. The five countries I listed are building projects that are more than 80% tunneled. New Zealand and Singapore’s projects are a hundred percent tunneled. In the US only 37% of track is tunneled. Alex Forrest: I think among countries which are capable of developing rapid transit, I would say the US performs pretty badly. It’s not that it’s without any bright spots. There are so many little things and big things that are broken about transit in America. Tamara Winter: This is Alex Forrest. Alex Forrest: I’m a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. Tamara Winter: We met online several years ago, through Twitter, naturally. I immediately became a fan of his insight and how he communicates his ideas about transit Alex Forrest: As with how transit got to be in its current state in America, there are so many culprits here. It’s hard to know where to start. Tamara Winter: Culprit one: labor costs. Alex Forrest: With our construction crews, we need them to be professional trained, doing the best work possible. So we don’t want to sell them short, but at the same time, we need to come up with contracts that can actually ensure that there will be future contracts or else, what are we doing here? Tamara Winter: Here’s Sarah Kaufman. Sarah Kaufman: As compared to most other countries that have transit systems, employers in the US have to pay out worker benefits, which significantly adds to the cost. Subway construction happening in France for example, the cost would be somewhat lower because the employer would not be responsible for the health and wellness of the workers. Tamara Winter: Culprit number two: practice. You know that old saying, “practice makes perfect”? Alex Forrest: The USA had a first rate best in the world transportation system, well into the 20th century. Archival audio: And here’s one of the most wonderful things about this vast country of ours. No matter where we want to travel, there are trains. Beautiful, comfortable… Tamara Winter: At its peak in the early 20th century, the US had over a quarter million miles of railroad tracks. Nearly every major US city, from Atlanta to Los Angeles, had either street cars or subways that a majority of commuters took to work. For more reasons than we have time to get into in this episode, the latter half of the 20th century saw the tides begin to turn. Alex Forrest: At that point, we have another host of structural decisions coming into play that kind of limited our ability to rebuild the system or to modernize it properly. And that kind of led us where we are today. Tamara Winter: There’s no consistent new building of transit projects. And so everyone is all kind of out of practice. So when a new project does need to get underway, it’s like starting from square one every time. Alex Forrest: A lot of transit agencies in the US should be developing in-house capability. The less you need to contract your plans, your operations, et cetera, out to external vendors the better you are just at the industry in general. The more things that we can be good at, the more effectively we can spend our money. It always sucks to see a huge chunk of your budget that isn’t even entering the transit system is just being paid to you to give to a consultant to do work that you should really know how to do yourself. Tamara Winter: Culprit number three: transit agencies. Often in the US, a patchwork of different agencies all have different motives. Sarah Kaufman: Here in New York, and this is true in several other US cities. We have this division of jurisdictions that is hard fought. The subways and buses are run by one organization, the commuter rails, Metro North and Long Island Railroad another. Meanwhile, we have the path train, which is one of the commuter trains to New Jersey run by the Port Authority, and then New Jersey Transit, which runs other trains to New Jersey. It’s pretty incredible how many different organizations needs to come together. And frankly, they don’t. When you look at other countries, they have more of a regional and national perspective on coordinating interests across boundaries. Tamara Winter: Lastly, perhaps the most guilty culprit: Us, the public. There’s that other old saying, time is money. Well, in the case of transit projects, the longer these things go on for, the more expensive they get. These delays are often a result of NIMBYs. People who favor projects in general, but when they happen near them, they say not in my backyard. We discussed NIMBY attitudes around new housing development in our previous episode. And the same issues can be seen when it comes to transit projects, too. Sarah Kaufman: We do have a public engagement process where people can oppose transit and here in the US, people wildly oppose transit. They do not want buses and subways coming to their neighborhoods and overwhelmingly they come to community meetings and oppose it. Whereas in other places, the community has less input because it’s seen as a community betterment project. And so that process, which can take years here, is a non-issue elsewhere. Tamara Winter: Residents will often weaponize regulations such as environmental protection laws in an attempt to stop what they see as an encroachment on their neighborhoods. Alex Forrest: People are loathed to have large construction projects. And so, tremendously excessive measures have to be taken to make sure the project is as not disruptive as possible, which perversely can end up dragging it out and making it disrupt people for longer. Trying to keep up with people’s demands about any given projects, not the least of which is the ability to block any given project or just modify it endlessly, which also adds costs. Tamara Winter: All these factors add to transit costs in the US. Excessive labor costs, a lack of in-house planning expertise, multiple out of step transit agencies, and NIMBY’s dragging out project timelines. Part of the reason that Alon Levy started the Transit Cost Project was because they believed that if the US was able to look outside it’s borderers, the shared knowledge and learning from other global cities will help transit projects everywhere. Even New York. Alon Levy: There’s this unfortunate tendency in New York to say, oh, New York, especially, you don’t have anything to learn from. So we don’t have anything to learn from to a degree. We don’t have anything to learn from Milan. We don’t have anything to learn from Stockholm. Tamara Winter: Every transit system has things it does well and things it can improve on. But the more I dove into the world of transit, the more I realize that all roads, or all railroads, lead to one place. Japan. Tamara Winter: This is the sound of Shinjuku station. It stretches for more than a half a mile through the Shinjuku ward and the heart of Tokyo. The area is a major commercial and administrative hub. Every day it sees 3.6 million passengers making it the busiest public transit center in the world. There are five railway and subway companies that intersect here. They link the Tokyo Metro to lines that service the suburbs West of the city. By one account, there are 53 platforms and over 200 entrances and exits to this massive complex. There’s also long distance bus service. While Shinjuku is the busiest station, it’s hardly alone. There are nearly a dozen other major transit hubs spread across various wards in Tokyo. Each of these services 1 to 3 million passengers daily. The rest of the world doesn’t even come close. Take New York’s Penn Station, the busiest train station in the entire Western hemisphere. It sees over 600,000 weekday passengers. That’s one sixth of Shinjuku station. In fact, of the 50 busiest train stations in the entire world, 45 are in Japan. Train ridership can only get to these high numbers when the system runs effectively. In fact, in Japan it’s nearly perfect. Junichi Sugiyama: So desu ne. Hai, hai. Tamara Winter: This is Mr. Junichi Sugiyama. Junichi Sugiyama: I live in Yokohama, Japan. Tamara Winter: He’s a journalist who writes about train, travel and business. And he’s ridden on every single rail system in Japan. Junichi Sugiyama: Next I’d like to like to ride the Amtrack across the United States. I will practice my English to help with my travels. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: Japanese people feel proud that the railroad system is so reliable and punctual, and when they can say there’s a train station close to where they live. Punctuality and accuracy is the most important thing so that people know exactly when to leave the house and when they will arrive at their destination. Tamara Winter: Let’s look at the Long Island Railroad, which operates out of Penn Station. The system considers a train on time if it arrives or departs within 5 minutes and fifty-nine seconds of the scheduled departure. Even with this generous measure, nearly 20,000 trains run late every year. Now contrast this to Tokyo. Every year the city’s entire system experiences accumulated delay of 20 seconds. Even these precious few seconds are an infraction worth an apology, like this statement that went viral in 2017. Archival audio: A company in Japan is apologizing after one of its trains left 20 seconds early. The company released a statement that reads in part, we deeply apologize for the severe inconvenience imposed upon our customers. That’s incredible. For comparison, to review [inaudible 00:24:28]. Tamara Winter: Imagine a trained company in the US making a formal public apology for leaving 20 seconds early. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: By increasing the frequency of trains, it will be more convenient for residents in the area. And subsequently, the town will develop. Ultimately, the goal is to have an accurate and efficient operating system. Tamara Winter: Tokyo also manages to integrate its various train operators very well. Here’s Alon Levy. Alon Levy: Tokyo has something very precious, which is that it manages to integrate urban and suburban transit very well. So the commuter rail lines in Tokyo run through the subway system and moreover the subway system was built to form a tight mesh within the city, but also connect with these commuter lines. So Tokyo essentially built a subway system at metropolitan scale. Tamara Winter: The system in Japan is not without its drawbacks. For example, in Tokyo the high number of competing transit companies leave riders paying with a jumble of different methods. But it’s efficient and on time, and the high quality of Japan’s transit system extends into the smallest details. Here’s Alex Forrest. Alex Forrest: There’s something much more every day about the train in Japan. It’s not considered the purview of only the marginalized in societies. It’s what everyone uses and everyone expects the best of it. I remember one time in my most recent visit in 2018, I rode a train out to one of the suburban terminals, got off, the train went out of service and the driver immediately got out of his cab and began walking down the entire length of the train, something like 11 cars and just picking up every little bit of trash that he found. That wasn’t the final cleaning. Obviously they’re going to have a crew deal with it, but on his way out, he’s just going to pick up everything and then let the next crew take over. And so that kind of attention to detail and just insistence on regular cleaning and maintenance goes a really long way. And I think that kind of focus also helps with other things like maintaining punctuality. If you care about the details, the details work themselves out. Tamara Winter: Clearly, the Japanese love their trains. And like so many love stories, it started in a time of war. Following its defeat in World War II, Japan was occupied by the American military. In Japan this is referred to as GHQ, or General Headquarters. Its aim was to establish democracy and rebuild the country Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: Prior to the war, the Japanese National Railways, or JNR for short, was built and operated by the federal government. But, when the war ended, JNR was relaunched by GHQ in order to make the railway system more sustainable. Converting it into a public enterprise. Tamara Winter: The government operated railway became a government owned public corporation. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: JNR incurred a large deficit of 37 trillion yen, which almost exceeded Japan’s national budget. Tamara Winter: On top of mounting debt, confrontation increased between management and the labor unions leading to numerous strikes. Fares were up, ridership was down. It all came to a head in 1987. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: The country couldn’t support it anymore. So they made a drastic reform. All of this debt was settled and the private company was created. This was the beginning of the JR Group. The corporation was split into six private passenger companies. Each was designated a different region of the country. There was also a freight and research company created. Most of the JR Group companies were granted the freedom to operate as private entities. And so they made efforts to lure back passengers. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: From the perspective of the rider, the staff have become kinder. After becoming JR, they started to focus on service. Because it’s an independently profitable and private company, they felt that they had to make a profit. And in order to make a profit, a lot of customers have to feel comfortable and satisfied. So the employee education was reviewed and the service was improved. Tamara Winter: There was also a marketing push. One example is this now famous series of JR Group Christmas commercials in the late 1980s. Archival audio: Christmas express. Tamara Winter: The train companies were allowed to capture the upside of their own service. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: It was stipulated by law that the national railway should not actually do business beyond building and managing railways. They were told that they could not invest in hotels, real estate, or super markets, as it would put pressure on private companies. However, once JR became a private company, it was possible to expand into new businesses, such as hotels, ski resorts, and real estate. Tamara Winter: And so JR Group companies had a larger financial stake in the areas around their train stations succeeding economically. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: The biggest business is to use stations to build shopping centers or condominiums. The station is not just a train station, but a base for business. It’s where people gather together. So you can have a lot of different businesses there. When Japanese railways developed, they bought a lot of land at a low price first, and later put down a railroad track and then the price of the land would go up. So they would sell it. Many urban railways in Japan have operated not only as railways, but also by diversified management. Tamara Winter: Today JR East, the JR Group company that operates through Tokyo is the largest, fully privatized passenger rail company in the world. Alex Forrest: This method of assuming the future added value that a rail line will bring to an area and then developing based on speculation on that value around the station to guarantee your ridership in the future, which they call value capture nowadays. Tamara Winter: In fact, this is not that different from how railways in the US were built. However, there are several key differences. Alex Forrest: When a lot of people hear this idea, they think that is the only way that Japanese companies are making money. A lot of them are diversified. A lot of these inter urban operators also run department stores, which they plant at their main stations. They also run smaller convenience stores. They are property developers and they sell apartment buildings and things like that, but they make most of their money from transportation sales. The part that makes them the money is everybody riding those trains. This was usually not the case in the USA where the main goal was just to make a killing off the speculation, and then you didn’t really care what happened next. That was very good at getting things built and really bad at getting things to stick around. Tamara Winter: And given his own background, Alex Forrest actually has a unique perspective on this. Alex Forrest: When I was born, my parents were still students and they were both studying Asian languages. And so very early in my life, my family moved to Japan. I lived there for two years in a suburb of Tokyo called Mishara. Once a week, we would head down to the train station, which is maybe a twenty to thirty minute walk and take the train two stops over to go to church. This train, even though it is ostensibly a commuter rail service, but it runs like eight car trains using electric overhead power, every 10 minutes. At the higher frequency stops, it’ll be coming every 2 to 3 minutes. This is the first train that I ever rode. I moved out before I was even five years old. And so I came back to America and lived in the Boston area at this point. And the great news was there were still trains to ride, but even as a kid, I could tell the difference in terms of the noise of the vehicles on board. They were clearly very old. The stations were pretty grimy at best, and often a lot of things weren’t working. The whole thing seemed to be shambolic compared to how incredibly organized and punctual everything was in Japan and clean. From that point on, I’ve always been interested in what transit is out there in the USA, in Japan, in the rest of the world. By the time I was in middle school, I had kind of already cemented a personal goal for myself to make transit in America, or at least in Massachusetts, as good as transit in Japan. Tamara Winter: It’s now 2022 in New York. Archival audio: This is the 96th street train. The next stop is 72nd street. Stand clear. Closing doors. Tamara Winter: The first phase of the Second Avenue subway has been running for just over five years. Archival audio: Good afternoon. We certainly meet in the most unusual places here in New York. Very delighted to be here beneath the second avenue subway. Something that we’ve been talking about for a very long time... Tamara Winter: Governor Kathy Hochul has moved forward phase two of the project, largely thanks to president Biden’s $23 billion infrastructure investment and jobs act. Archival audio: Ladies and gentlemen, next stop 125th street. With that, I’d like to introduce a gentleman... Tamara Winter: And the investment will go even further at this time. While phase one served mainly a high wealth area, phase two will extend into East Harlem, a neighborhood, largely working class and highly reliant on public transit. According to the governor’s office, 70% of residents here use public transit to commute versus the citywide average of 55%. For the people along the next phase of Second Avenue, this development would be a huge life change. And that’s the thing. Transit is the type of infrastructure with the power to change people’s daily life. Whether in New York, or a city like Dallas, where I grew up. Alex Forrest: New York, you get this great mixing of social strata on the train, unlike you found in Dallas. And what’s the critical difference here, right? Is it that New Yorkers are cleaner and more polite than people from Texas? I don’t believe that’s the case. I think what’s going on here is just that New Yorkers have a much more useful service around. There are lots of problems in the New York subway, but just the fact of its availability, that’s still useful enough to be pulling people from all realms of society together to take advantage of it. And it becomes just an everyday part of life. And I feel like this is probably the single largest thing that I wish I could convince more American transit operators to take seriously, the idea that you’re not offering a service for any subset of the population. You’re trying to offer a general purpose service, which is therefore useful to every subset. Anywhere there’s a person, there’s at least a potential rider. Tamara Winter: In the end, I am perhaps foolishly optimistic about the prospects for a more transit oriented feature in the US. For one thing, young people are becoming more vocal about their desire for alternatives to driving. And as America continues to age, developing these alternatives will be increasingly important for seniors who don’t want to be relegated to their homes in their later years. I see bright spots like Cul-de-Sac, a new car-free city development being built in Tempe, Arizona and private companies like Brightline in Florida and Texas Central are also developing intercity rail projects in places that have long been deeply car-centric. I’m hoping we’ll see a lot more experimentation in the years to come. Alex Forrest: I’ve always said, inertia is the hardest thing to overcome, and it’s not that there’s anything technically infeasible about modernizing transit here. It’s just, we haven’t done things differently in so long. Even convincing people if they need to do things differently can be very difficult. Sarah Kaufman: America has a real addiction to cars and most of our communities are built around use of cars. And so it can be very hard to give up car usage, even if somebody tried. At the same time, I think that the younger generations in the US are seeing that and taking advantage of transit and biking and other options as better ways to get around. I hope that the interest in transit continues. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak.

I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. We’ll see you next time. Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-Sides, where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. On the most recent episode of Beneath the Surface, we focused on the state of public transit in the US, and we compared it with one of the most train loving countries in the world: Japan. For this episode, I interviewed Alex Forrest. He is currently a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. I’ve been a fan and a friend of Alex’s for years. He’s cultivated a community of trained fanatics on Twitter…train Twitter that is, where he shares his thoughts on the state of train travel in places like the US and Japan, where he lived for several years as a child. His username is @380kmh, which might seem a bit random, but it’s the top design speed for most high speed trains. In our conversation, we discussed his current work in Springfield, the formative years he spent in Japan, the history of train development in the US, and more. So here is my conversation with Alex Forrest, which has been lightly edited. I hope you enjoy. So the first question is always the hardest. Introduce yourself. Tell me your title and why are we talking today? Alex Forrest: My name’s Alex Forrest. I’m a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. And we are talking today about transit around the world and how to do it well. Tamara Winter: Tell me a little bit about your current work as a transit planner. When we were chatting about this episode a little bit, you told me that you just won funding for two lines. Is that right? Alex Forrest: Two bus routes, right. So my work in transit is limited to bus operations. That’s the transit provider that I work for, operates out of three bus garages in Western Mass, about 35 to 40 routes. It varies a little bit by time of year. And in the past couple years, I was able to win funding from MassDOT to operate two new services. Both are kind of longer range intercity kind of services. One of them runs on a roughly hourly frequency on the Interstate. The other is just a three times a day through a state highway connecting to Worcester, it’s a service that we’ve had a lot of interest in riders from. And I’m a little disappointed that we couldn’t provide more than just these three round trips, but it was great to be able to get that running. Tamara Winter: Talk to me about the transit situation broadly in Massachusetts, and also kind of how does the transit system in the broader north-east differ from the rest of the US? Alex Forrest: Massachusetts works nicely as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country in that you have Boston, which is our north-east, I suppose. And then you have the rest of the state, which I mean, the rest of the state was settled very early. So it doesn’t necessarily have the same town patterns that you’ll find in the rest of the country. But in terms of transit availability, I think it’s a working analogy, it does the trick, which is to say MBTA is the transit provider in Boston. They run four subway lines, one of which doubles as kind of a surface streetcar route. They run a myriad of bus lines, including some nominal BRT routes. They also run ferries and commuter rail around Eastern Massachusetts. So very extensive network. One of the top performing networks for ridership in the USA. There are also, I want to say, maybe 15 or so regional transit authorities elsewhere in the state. Most of which have sort of one central city and a defined service area. And their job is to provide exclusively bus operations. Now it’s not written in, but that’s just how it works out, throughout the other parts of the state, not a bad model conceptually, but one of the oversights of it is that they made no account for travel between the regional transit authorities, which is why this route to Worcester was such a big deal. I mean, in Eastern Mass, the various regional transit authorities at least can get close to Boston or connect to an MBTA service. But beyond Worcester, that starts to become impossible and broadly speaking, the RTAs obviously get a lot less money than the MBTA. They have much cheaper services to run in the first place, but one of the consequences of this is that very few...it might only be PVTA, which is the one that I work at, very few RTAs actually offer weekend service. Most of them only offer service on weekdays. I think until recently, that was the case, even in Worcestor, which would be the next largest after us. But you will want to look into that. I’m not sure, they might have started running weekend service recently. Tamara Winter: It’s kind of wild though. You said this is sort of a microcosm for the rest of the US. Talk to me about how you would rate the US public transit system kind of compared to other countries specifically in regards to rapid transit. And when you decide on a rating, I’m curious why the US merits that rating. Alex Forrest: I think among countries which are capable of developing rapid transit, just because that is an admittedly pretty high bar, and so a lot of countries are still working on that or don’t really need to, I would say the US performs pretty badly. I don’t know about a out of 10 score and it’s not that it’s without any bright spots, but just there are so many little things and big things that are broken about transit in America. As far as the analogy goes for Massachusetts, one of the issues is that transit is very much a localized affair. And so where it exists at all, you might have reasonable transit, but anywhere else as kind of a national system, it’s sorely lacking. So connections between city areas are probably the worst component in the USA. And then within cities, there are various other issues just concerning schedule availability. Like I talked about the no weekend service, that’s hardly unique to Massachusetts, it’s true all around the USA. Even some rail systems. I want to say the Los Angeles commuter rail, I’m not convinced they run on weekends, or if they do, most commuter rail systems which do run on weekends, offer greatly reduced service. So, they prioritize specifically the times when they think it’s most likely people will ride. Which again, that sounds very reasonable, but that’s not actually the best way to run a transit network and we have empirical evidence to suggest otherwise. So we don’t need to be led by assumptions there. Tamara Winter: To ask maybe a silly question, because there are theories that I can see, for example, for why this is the case. The US developed much later than its peers, the decision-making power to create transit, particularly between cities is kind of difficult to, I guess, manage because of our Federalist system. Why is our transit so lacking? Alex Forrest: As you kind of suggested, it’s definitely one of those path dependent problems. The system is lacking here just because we sort of evolved this way through various small decisions. But the part of the reason we’re lacking now is because we’re actually very, very far ahead of the curve, about a 100 years ago. And it’s not quite as simple as the success went to our heads and we thought nobody could do it better than us, and so if we can’t do it well, we don’t even need to bother. It’s not quite that simple, but that’s definitely part of it. And the USA had a first rate, best in the world transportation system, well into the 20th century. But even before that, even before the early 20th century, there were some fundamental problems in how we developed our system. And those problems led to complications when the original developers of railways and local transit networks in America started to run into cost issues, not entirely just because of a lack of business, but also because they were hamstrung in their ability to set their own fares. A lot of municipal ordinances would require transit providers to operate a flat fare across an entire region, which is not best practice. You really want to charge by distance traveled. And also, that flat fare was limited. At the time, I think it was a nickel or a dime, just because we’re talking about the 1920s, ’50s here. The inability to raise fares to deal with drops in revenue kind of ensured that the old railway operators couldn’t survive and a handover would be necessary. So then we get to kind of step two, which is the mid-20th century handover when a lot of the trolley companies were replaced by bus companies and the intercity private railways got out of the passenger business entirely with the formation of Amtrak. And so at that point, we have another host of structural decisions coming into play that kind of limited our ability to rebuild the system or to modernize it properly. And that kind of led us to where we are today. There have been various attempts, no shortage of money spent, although at the same time, kind of not enough, it’s complicated. I guess you could say they spent the money on not the best things for keeping the system going. And even to this day, a lot of baked in costs like that, just from the way we’ve done things so far. I’ve always said, inertia is the hardest thing to overcome. And it’s not that there’s anything technically infeasible about modernizing transit here, it’s just, we haven’t done things differently in so long, even convincing people they need to do things differently can be very difficult. Tamara Winter: It’s funny, if we were re-cutting a trailer for the podcast today, most of what you just said would be kind of a prime target for it, because I think this is kind of the crux of creating infrastructure. From the outside, as I’ve been talking to people, whether they’re building new cities, so talking about kind of what is it about Lagos that would necessitate a new city? Or for example, the Salton Sea and its potential to be kind of a lithium mine, it’s interesting. There isn’t kind of one culprit for why things aren’t better than they are or why some things worked. It really does appear to be kind of pack dependence in inertia all the way down. And you add into that, infrastructure typically doesn’t have...it needs a policy entrepreneur, but it’s very difficult to kind of just make large scale changes even when we know what it is we need to do. And I guess speaking of cost, you kind of mentioned this in your last answer. I’m curious, if you could elaborate, in your experience, why are transit costs in the US so much more expensive and why does it take so much longer to develop transit in the US than in other similarly situated countries? Alex Forrest: Before I get started, I want to just break down the two main sides of cost in transit. One being the operating expense, just to pay the drivers, maintain the vehicles, keep the service on the road. And then the other being capital expense, which would be to replace the vehicles, get new ones to build any stations, garages, any kind of train service requires capital expense on its track. Both are more expensive in the USA, but the operating costs are, I would say, a lot more defensible by and large. They’re not perfectly defensible. There’s some problems there too. Really, it is the capital costs that are the biggest problem. It’s the large infrastructure projects. Those are the ones where the costs are just wildly inflated. And again, as with how transit got to be in its current state in America, there are so many culprits here, it’s hard to know where to start. There is the kind of NIMBY angle where people are loath to have large construction projects. And so, tremendously excessive measures have to be taken to make sure the project is as not disruptive as possible, which perversely can end up dragging it out and making it disrupt people for longer. So it’s trying to keep up with people’s demands about any given project, not least of which is the ability to block any given project or just modify it endlessly, which also adds costs. Part of it has to do with staffing and what, I guess, I can only call unrealistic agreements with labor. Which, again, this comes back to the inertia thing, it’s obviously critical that we have well paid and compensated drivers for any of our vehicles. You don’t want people crashing on the road. And likewise with our construction crews, we need them to be professional, trained, doing the best work possible. So we don’t want to sell them short, but at the same time, we need to come up with contracts that can actually ensure that there will be future contract. What are we doing here? This is a problem that Japan had a crisis with in the late ’70s to 1980s, which ultimately led to the privatization of their national railways. There were various causes, it boiled down to a labor dispute and they were able to work it out and solve that issue back then. So yes, in the USA, right, we have just regulations. People’s ability to interfere with the project can ramp up the cost tremendously. We have relatively expensive labor, not even the expensive labor is the issue, but the overstaffing, where you just have way more people on a crew than you particularly need to do it. This also shows up in transit operations where you might have...the practice of having conductors on a train to pick up tickets is definitely not the way they do it in Japan, for example, where either if a train line is so quiet that you can’t just have fare gates at the station, then the driver of the train will check the tickets instead of having another guy wander around to do it, needless to say, those are only on the quieter rural lines. So I guess that’s only two subjects right now. There are more, I don’t even want to get started on the EBA and requirements for environmental impact statements, which, again, depending on how zealously the jurisdiction wants to push the issue, they can take years, if not...I don’t think any have taken more than a decade. Tamara Winter: Well, speaking of a transit project that took more than a decade, this episode begins with the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan, which was first proposed, I believe, in a little over a 100 years ago. I wonder, are there other transit projects you can think of in the US that have similarly been extremely, exorbitantly expensive and also taken forever just to get off the ground? Alex Forrest: Yes. I think, frankly, you would’ve a much harder time finding projects for which that isn’t the case. I know that just recently in Boston, there’s a lot of celebration as a extension of the Green Line into Somerville, Mass opened. This goes to Union Square in Somerville, which is very close to where I lived in the mid ‘90s, living just on the border of Somerville and Cambridge. So it’s very heartening to think that finally, my old neighborhood has its own stop. I don’t remember the exact year, but I do remember when this project was being discussed back in at least 2004, if not earlier, I think versions of it have been on the drawing board since at least the 1940s. This particular round was finally authorized and it began construction sometime around also 2004, I want to say. And it was originally slated to open in 2011. So here we are now, it’s part open. There’s still more of it to open, which I think will open later this year, but they haven’t even finished opening it yet. And I’m as happy as the next guy that it’s finally here, but well over budget. I mentioned neighbors getting involved to just jack up the costs. Sometimes that does produce nice fruits, even if it does inflate the cost significantly. In this case, it involved connecting to a multi-use bike path, which branched off the Green Line Extension. There was already a bike path branching off it. They just wanted to run the bike path parallel to this new extension and connect it into the larger city bike network. A nice addition, but again, not strictly related to this project, did not need to get bundled in, inflated the timelines and the planning process, led to constant revisions. And so finally, here we are, halfway through 2022 and we’re not even done opening it. Tamara Winter: By Second Avenue Subway standards, that’s actually very, very impressive. But, of course, we are grading on the world’s biggest curve. Alex, I’ve known you for a few years and you have kind an unusual story with how you came into transit. Tell me a little bit about your unusual childhood and why you got so interested in transit in the first place. Alex Forrest: When I was born, my parents were still students and they were still kind of moving around quite a bit and they were both studying Asian languages. And so very early in my life, my family moved to Japan. This was in 1991, and I lived there for two years in a suburb of Tokyo called Machida. And I would describe Machida as on one hand, very much a suburb, outside the city proper, mostly single family housing, but also, it has nearly half a million residents right now. And it’s got its fair share of large buildings as well. So it’s a suburb, but a Tokyo suburb, to be clear. Anyway, living out there for two years, I was about old enough to go to preschool. I attended a preschool a short walk from my parents’ apartment, but every week, once a week, we would head down to the train station, which is maybe a 20 to 30 minute walk, shorter on a bike or a bus, and take the train two stops over to go to church. And so this train, even though it is ostensibly a commuter rail service, it’s far out in the suburbs, I don’t know, maybe 15 miles away from Tokyo, I’m not sure. But it runs eight car trains, using electric overhead power, every 10 minutes. And that’s where the local stops at the higher frequency stops, it’ll be coming every two to three minutes. So to have this out in the suburbs, this beautiful train, this is the first train that I ever rode, of course. And so if you look at Japanese culture, there’s certainly a carve out for the train nerds. They’re generally photographers. They like to take photos of trains and they know everything about them. I can see why kids growing up there would do that because the same effect hit me. The only difficulty was I moved out before I was even five years old. And so I came back to America and lived in the Boston area at this point. And the great news was there were still trains to ride. I was so happy. I didn’t have to abandon trains forever. The downside was they were American trains and that did not at all dim my enthusiasm as a five-year-old, six-year-old kid. I still loved riding them, but even as a kid, I could tell the difference in terms of the noise of the vehicles on board. They were clearly very old, the stations were pretty grimy, at best, and often a lot of things weren’t working. Just in general, the whole thing seemed to be shambolic compared to how incredibly organized and punctual everything was in Japan, and clean. So anyway, just from that point on, I’ve always been interested in what transit is out there in the USA, in Japan, in the rest of the world, just always taking the chance to ride it whenever I can. But by the time I was in middle school, I had kind of already cemented a personal goal for myself to make transit in America or at least in Massachusetts, as good as transit in Japan. Tamara Winter: It’s so crazy because the way you talk about Japan, I literally thought you had grown up there for many, many years. It’s amazing that all it took was two years and two of the most formative years in your childhood for you to kind of catch the train bug. Alex Forrest: Right. Well, and I have siblings as well and they didn’t quite catch the bug either. So it certainly depends on the person, but it was, I guess...you said it best, it was a very formative time in my life. And so those at the stage when I was just beginning to form memories, so basically, my earliest memories are of living in Japan, but I was also not so young that the whole thing was a blur. I had pretty concrete memories, for instance, of our trip on the last day when we were heading to Narita Airport, I remember the train we were on because it had a nice LED animated map showing the route we were going. And so I was just mesmerized, I could check off every station as we stopped on it and see the train in advance. Tamara Winter: You mentioned that you could clearly see, even at that age, the differences between US trains and Japanese trains. In your opinion, what are some of the main, maybe social and cultural differences that affect kind of how the US and Japan treat public transit? Alex Forrest: I think Japan has a reputation for very good manners and that’s incredibly well-deserved. In general, Japanese people are just very polite and they’re very social in public. They’re not going to make a mess in general or make a lot of noise or have a loud conversation, which is just kind of broadly refreshing, but hard to really imitate here. As far as kind of attitudes, social and cultural attitudes, there’s also sort of the impression that...and I mean, it helps to be on the cutting edge of the technology to do this, but there’s something much more glamorous and just every day about the train in Japan. It’s not considered the purview of only the marginalized in societies, it’s what everyone uses and everyone expects the best of it. Part of the reason that any reformers had any leverage here was that the public expected and demanded better service of the railways than they were delivering at that time. I’m hard pressed to come up with any more...you’ve heard the saying, "Why take a shower? I’ll just get dirty again." Tamara Winter: Yes. Alex Forrest: When, in fact, the point of taking a shower is precisely because you will get dirty again, so you want to be clean until that happens. I feel like that is kind of the attitude just as far as general maintenance goes. When I’m in Japan...I was visiting some years ago, I went to my old train station and they just had a guy...he was a part-timer apparently, but this is a very common thing there. They just had a guy walking up and down the staircases at the train station, just wiping down the banisters and walls, in the middle of the afternoon, it was 2:00 PM. He looked like he might have even been a retiree, which is why I gathered he was a part-time worker because senior citizens will often end up taking just odd jobs like that. But the fact that they actually have a position for this, you’re the guy who just wipes the station down every few minutes or so during the afternoon, they probably have another guy for the evening. But that kind of constant maintenance, much more so than people’s cultural inclination not to litter, is what makes the difference there. I feel like despite the well-deserved reputation for manners in Japan, people also tend to forget that they’re just human. People absolutely do litter there and they’ll leave things behind just out of forgetfulness, of course. I remember one time in my most recent visit in 2018, I rode a train out to one of the suburban terminals, got off, the train went out of service and the driver immediately got out of his cab and began walking down the entire length of the train, something like 11 cars and just picking up every little bit of trash that he found. That wasn’t the final cleaning. Obviously they’re going to have a crew deal with it, but on his way out, he’s just going to pick up everything and then let the next crew take over. And so that kind of attention to detail and just insistence on regular cleaning and maintenance goes a really long way. And I think that kind of focus also helps with other things like maintaining punctuality. Just if you care about the details, the details work themselves out. Tamara Winter: There’s something kind of interesting too. I don’t know the extent to which Japanese people just care more about their services, but it does seem like they expect more of their services than maybe we do. You can see those differences, we don’t have to just look at Japan and the US, even in say Dallas, where I grew up, and New York, where I live now, in Dallas, it’s expected that you really only ride the light rail if you need it as a connection downtown, let’s say you work downtown or just, if you can’t afford your own private transit, whereas in New York, I wouldn’t say it’s like Japan in that it’s totally ubiquitous, but it’s pretty ubiquitous, right? It’s not unusual to see people of very different kind of socioeconomic statuses riding the train together. And so even in the US, you can kind of see, and people in New York, of course, are accustomed to, and sort of demand much more. Alex Forrest: New York, you get this great mixing of social strata on the train, unlike you found in Dallas. And what is the critical difference here? Is it that New Yorkers are cleaner and more polite than people from Texas? I don’t believe that’s the case. I think what’s going on here is just that New Yorkers have a much more useful service around. And as you said, it’s not necessarily as useful and ubiquitous as in Tokyo, although certainly, it comes closer than anywhere else in America. And it’s also, certainly not as well-maintained as what you have in Tokyo. There are lots of problems with the New York Subway, but just the fact of its availability. As terrible as these trains are, as dirty or as overheated or whatever the problem is, that’s still useful enough to be pulling people from all realms of society together to take advantage of it. And it becomes just an everyday part of life. And I feel like this is probably the single largest thing that I wish I could convince more American transit operators to take seriously, the idea that you’re not offering a service for any subset of the population, you’re trying to offer a general purpose service, which is therefore useful to every subset. Whenever a new bus route wants to get proposed, you’ll usually have some interested party who says, "Ah, we need bus service here. There’s a lot of jobs here. There’s a lot of houses here." And generally, in this assumption is not just that there’s a lot of jobs or houses, but, "There’s a lot of low income houses here. We need a bus here." "Oh, there’s a benefit center here. We need a bus to go there." And so if you have a bus line that only goes between those two places, between the low income apartments and the Social Security offices, that doesn’t particularly do a good job of addressing the needs of people in those apartments or those offices, let alone anybody else. The people in those apartments also need to go to the doctor. They also need to go to the grocery store. They also would like to visit friends. These are all trip purposes that are being completely ignored in the calculus of where to put the bus and you can solve all these issues if you just stop thinking of, "Ah, we only need to worry about these particular people who are going to ride." No, you have to think about anywhere there’s a person, there’s at least a potential rider. Tamara Winter: I love that tagline. If there’s a person, there’s a potential rider. I want to talk about Japan a little bit more. Can you explain sort of briefly...although I don’t know if this is a brief kind of question, how Japanese rail companies operate as private companies? You’ve mentioned this earlier, but specifically around real estate speculation and development. Alex Forrest: It’s actually not that different, at least superficially, from how a lot of the railways in the USA were built up. Although there are, I think, a couple of critical differences that I hope I can get to, but the premise of the land use speculation really was something that happened around the time that the cities were still growing. And the railway industry was still pretty new in Japan, but you had suburban streetcar operators in say early 1900s Tokyo and Osaka. Some of which became quite successful and began running what in America, we would call interurban lines, which are not mainline freight, but they basically have the same standards in terms of their heavy rail operations. Generally running electricity, even for the USA back then in the 1900s. But in America, the interurbans all ultimately got shut down more or less, a few survivors, modern transit lines. But in Japan, a lot of them were founded as private companies. Most of them were able to stay as private companies and gradually phased away from streetcar operations to focus on their interurban lines, which over the years, were extended, branches were added, through service onto the subways was added. And so these interurban lines evolved into modern suburban rail. These are for companies that remain private the entire time. Japan also had a national railway industry, which originated as an amalgam of government funded lines and privately built lines, was run by the Imperial Japanese government through the war, and then by the reconstruction government after the war, and which was ultimately privatized in 1987 and broken up into several subsidiary companies. So the premise is you build a line out of the city, you develop the land around that line and therefore you plant passengers for yourself who will then use your line to go back and forth to the city. This is indeed how a lot of rail in America got built too, at least at the commuter level, not necessarily at the intercity level, but one of the most critical differences that a lot of people who are interested in this method, which they call value capture nowadays, assuming the future added value that a rail line will bring to an area and then developing based on speculation on that value around the station to guarantee your ridership in the future. When a lot of people hear this idea, they think that that is the only way that Japanese companies are making money. A lot of them are diversified. A lot of these interurban operators also run department stores, which they plant at their main stations. They also run smaller convenience stores. They are property developers and they sell apartment buildings and things like that, but they make most of their money from transportation sales. Cannot emphasize this enough. If you look at a suburban operator in Japan, yes, they are invested in land use. Yes, they do take steps to make sure that their own ridership will be there, but that’s not the part which makes them the money. That’s just the background work. The part that makes them the money is everybody riding those trains or buses. And this was usually not the case in the USA where the main goal was just to make a killing off the speculation and then you didn’t really care what happened next. You’d have a success where they take over the company. And that was very good at getting things built and really bad at getting things to stick around. And so, I think, that at least was part of why you had these interurban operators and streetcar operators in America running into trouble. I don’t mean to say it’s entirely their fault either. We cannot underestimate the impact of having tons of cars on the road, since a lot of American transit operators didn’t have dedicated rights of way, and so they’d be slowed down by anything that got in their path. But that’s also to say, I don’t want people to think it was entirely the evil car companies that did this. There were some really serious structural problems with American railway operators, which really doomed their efforts in the passenger rail business. Might have been overcome, but would not have come from the railways themselves, I don’t think. You would’ve needed a government intervention, which was a very, very tough sell and remains that to this day. Tamara Winter: That’s kind of the natural next question for me. So you say you might have an operator in kind of a regional line or a smaller line. Yes, they might invest in land and they might be speculating, but that’s really not where they make their money. How does that model compare to how transit agencies across the US are expected to function? Are there any US agencies that work like that? Alex Forrest: I don’t know if you could say there are any agencies that work like that, but there are, at least recently, some prominent private railway companies that have started operation. There’s Brightline in Florida, which is a private intercity railway line, which is, as far as I know, doing its best to develop the areas around its stations. You may be familiar with the term transit oriented development. Anyway, Brightline has taken advantage of value capture and TOD to build up its station areas. This is why they’re so interested in Miami and making sure their station location is close to downtown. Unlike the Amtrak Station, which is more peripheral. I know that Brightline is attempting to add a high speed line to Vegas from near LA. I’m not sure where that project stands. I just know that many operators have tried to do that route and the latest ones to step up to the plate are Brightline, so I wish them the best. The other one is actually a Japanese venture in America, where one of the companies that resulted from the breakup of the Japanese national railways is currently invested in developing a high speed railway line in Texas, between Dallas and Houston. In America, this is called the Texas Central Railway. It’s a subsidiary or partner company for the Central Japan Railway, which operates the busiest high speed line in Japan. The one from Tokyo to Osaka. And generally, as operations are, rural operations in Central Japan and commuter metropolitan operations around Nagoya, Japan’s third city. Tamara Winter: That’s one I’ve been hearing about for years. I didn’t realize it was a Japanese company behind that, which gives me a lot of hope for it. Alex Forrest: That has definitely improved my impression of the project as well. At the very least, I understand that the people who are working on it are technically very knowledgeable with literal decades of experience running the busiest high-speed railway in the world, whether or not that will be able to translate to Texas is still kind of anyone’s guess. But I don’t think you could find a better crew to do the job ultimately. Tamara Winter: Tell me, what do you think are the lessons and learnings for the US, as you kind of think back to your own experiences in Japan, and then now as a transit planner yourself, what do you think that US cities should aim to learn from the way that many Japanese cities operate transit? Alex Forrest: As far as learning from Japan, I’d already mentioned about planning for a general population. That’s pretty critical, but just as far as operations go, I think I would encourage them to not give up on the concept of farebox recovery. Even the most ardent transit advocates in America will frequently drop the line that there’s no transportation service that pays for itself. And this is where the reference to the Japanese providers, not only making their money from value capture is very important because usually the people who say that no system is profitable, will bring up the value capture argument to hand wave Japan’s example away, but that’s literally not true. A lot of these are publicly traded companies. You can look up their books and see where they’re getting their money from. I’d make a point to check the Odakyu Fact Book whenever they update it, which is once a year, that’s the line that I used to ride when I was a kid in the suburbs there. So we can confirm that it is indeed possible to make more than 100% of your operating costs from your fares. And the question is just, how do you do this? And there are so many ways to approach this that just don’t even get entertained because in America, they don’t think it’s an ideal worth pursuing. They don’t think there’s any finish line to that race. They think if you start focusing on your farebox recovery, you’ll never hit a 100%. You’ll waste a lot of time. You’ll have to make austere cuts on anything that isn’t profitable immediately. That’s really not how this works, really. If you’re only making 10% of your budget from fares, think about what you can do to get that to 20%. That’s not much, you don’t need to raise your fares necessarily, right? You might just need to change your fare structure. You might offer a discount on passes, which gets people to buy passes more often, which gets them to use the system more often. And then, hey, they don’t always have a pass or they might not ride the pass as much as the pass is paying for. And so you’re still making more money than if they never rode at all, right? Put it like this. If you buy a monthly pass for $50 and $50 pays for, let’s say, 30 trips on the bus, and you only use that monthly pass 20 times, transit operators has made a lot more money off those 20 trips than if they were all sold individually. And so, little steps that can be taken to improve farebox recovery. It’s not just about raising revenue, it’s also about reducing your costs. Obviously, you don’t need to change your fares at all if you can come up with a way to bring your operating costs down by, say, 5%, right? Again, it’s just that they don’t even entertain the idea that you could ever hit 100% profitability that they won’t take the smallest step in that direction. On the contrary, a lot of providers are talking now about trying to go fare free, which I admire where that’s coming from, but I can’t say that that would work out very well for us, even in the medium-term, let alone the long-term. Tamara Winter: It’s interesting because in the same way that a lot of the challenges that you see in infrastructure are not things that have a single cause, similarly, if you wanted to kind of fix sort of broken systems or even systems that are just operating suboptimally in some regard, these little changes...I wouldn’t necessarily think, "Oh, if you’re making 10% of your operating costs, maybe try and make 20 in revenue." That seems very doable. And I guess, as you look across the United States, do you see pockets of optimism? Alex Forrest: Yes. Not the least of which is my own local situation. It was nice to get a couple of routes approved. One of them’s doing badly, one of them’s doing well, but both of those were what I expected when I went into this. So I guess just things are going as expected there. Tamara Winter: Tell me again, just what did you get approved? And congratulations by the way. Alex Forrest: Oh, thank you. Thank you. And I should emphasize, I did not work on these grant proposals alone at all. So I had the collaboration of my great coworker over at PVTA, the director of planning over there. But one of the routes was a thrice per day, five days a week weekend-focused service, connecting Amherst, Mass. and Worcester Mass. The other is a roughly hourly to half hourly service along Interstate 91, between Northampton, Holyoke, at the Holyoke Mall and Downtown Springfield. Like I said a minute ago, the Springfield one has been a success. The Worcester one, not so much, but both are extremely well received. And the shortcomings of the Worcester route, I was well aware of when I went into designing the schedule with the very limited funds that were on the table. We, again, at the end of the day, only provide as much as people pay for, which is one of the reasons I think it’s so important that transit providers try to maximize their farebox revenue because the more your riders are paying for you to exist, the more you will be responding to the needs of your riders in continuing to exist. When you get all of your budget from state allocations, taxpayer funding, that money is just as good as any other money. The problem is that you have to address the concerns of the people giving it to you in order to get it. And their concerns may or may not line up with the actual interests of riders. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. The more of your money is coming from riders, the less likely you are to get paid to do something you wish you wouldn’t do, which happens all the time, I got to say. Tamara Winter: It’s a bit of a principal-agent problem. If the money isn’t coming from people that are actually using the service, it may or may not be useful. Alex Forrest: Right. Essentially, you’ll always reflect the priorities of whoever’s paying you to do your job. You want those priorities to line up with the users of your service, ideally, but as far as pockets of optimism, there are a lot. I think the thing which has had my attention the most in the past few years has been this phenomenon of bus network rationalizations. There’s a well regarded transit planner called Jarrett Walker who runs a private consulting firm, which I would say specializes in these network redesigns. Some of the fruits have been great. One of the first cities they went at was Houston. I know they’ve also done work in at least Miami, I want to say Seattle, and I want to say Rhode Island as well, at one point, or they might be doing Rhode Island now. I don’t quite recall, but these redesigns, essentially, they aim to have a cost neutral redeployment of existing resources. So you have X number of buses. You can pay X number of driver hours and X amount of fuel. Could you, just by changing where the buses are running, get a more effective system? Focusing on allowing people to transfer outside the central hub, as well as the central hub. Having services more frequent on more routes, even if that means having slightly fewer routes. The routes that you have will be higher quality. They’ll more consistently attract people to them because they’re more useful. And so this tendency doesn’t seem to be losing any steam. More and more cities are picking it up. The results have been very good where they’ve been attempted. This was pre-COVID, so I don’t know what happened after that, unfortunately, but pre-COVID, I do remember that any articles that would decry the general crisis of transit ridership in America would have to overlook Houston, which despite being a generally bus network, was actually improving its ridership at that time, while most of the country was struggling and losing ridership year after year, and it hadn’t been doing so before the redesign. So something clicked there and I want more cities to get this opportunity. I’ve taken a crack at it in my spare time, looking at our local network, but I don’t know. I feel like I’m maybe a little too in the weeds to do a good job. I’m already too accustomed to the usual special demands, special concessions, that I can’t quite bring myself to say, "Ah, well, rationally speaking, we shouldn’t do that." I know these guys too well, they’ll come yelling at me the next week if I mess it up. So it can be nice to have some outside eyes looking at it. At the same time, I think another thing that a lot of transit agencies in the US should be prioritizing more and some of them are, and doing a very good job at it, is developing in-house capability. The less you need to contract your plans, your operations, et cetera, out to external vendors, the better you are just at the industry in general, some of these Japanese suburban railway companies, one of them in particular, happens to also be one of the largest manufacturers of rail cars in Japan. So they make trains for themselves, but also for other companies in Japan and also around the world. Again, just the more things that we can be good at, the more effectively we can spend our money. It always sucks to see a huge chunk of your budget that isn’t even entering the transit system. It’s just being paid to you to give to a consultant to do work that you should really know how to do yourself. Tamara Winter: Alex, this has been honestly a delight. It’s crazy, I’ve known you for years, but I feel like I’m just meeting you again for the first time. It’s really wonderful to know that there are people working, not just in kind of the big transit systems, like in New York or in WMATA, in DC, but also in places like Springfield. And I appreciate so much that you gave us your time. Alex Forrest: No, thank you again so much for having me. It’s been a pleasure. It was great to catch up. We should definitely talk again soon.

Okay, that’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Archived audio Commercial: Why you eating a mint, baby? So I can kiss you on the face. Why? Because it’s National Night. What? Tamara Winter: That’s an ad for Mentos, the breath mint. It’s also kind of an ad for Singapore. It was launched in 2012 to coincide with Singapore’s National Day. Archived audio Commercial: I’m talking about making a baby, baby. You ready? Let’s go. Tamara Winter: National Day is celebrated on August 9th, the day that Singapore gained independence after separating from Malaysia. Traditionally, it’s marked by fireworks, official speeches and a massive parade. Archived audio Ladies and gentlemen, let’s welcome our cabinet ministers, senior ministers and deputy prime minister to The Float @ Marina Bay. Here come our cabinet ministers streaming into the… Tamara Winter: Dignitaries wave flags and the prime minister gives a National Day address, a little bit like the State of the Union in the US. In fact, in 2012, the same year as the Mentos ad, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong discussed Singapore’s falling birth rates in his address. Archived audio Lee Hsien Loong: But alas, we are having too few babies and therefore we have a problem. The long-term trend is down, but we cannot give up. We’ve got to do something about it. Married couples are having fewer children. On average, now, each married woman has two kids. Previously, it was more, so this number has also been coming down. Tamara Winter: So, Mentos to the rescue? Archived audio Commercial: It’s National Night. Let’s make Singapore’s birth rate spike. Birth rate ain’t going to spike itself. Singapore’s population, it needs some increasing. Tamara Winter: In the US, we aren’t used to ads like that, or to hearing politicians talk about these issues in the way that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong does, even though similar trends are at work here. The birth rate in the United States is also falling. Personally, I’ve always been drawn to these questions about populations. Birth rates, changes in the age of a population and what those numbers might mean. It always felt like a natural fascination to me. See, I grew up in a large family, and when I say large, I mean large. I’m not exaggerating when I tell you I don’t even know precisely how many cousins I have, and that’s just first cousins. Who knows how many second or third cousins I’ve got running around out there? And even though I haven’t met all of my cousins yet—they’re scattered across a few continents—I feel extremely fortunate to have an international support system that spans generations. I also want to have my own kids someday. And by the standards of most people my age, I want to have a lot of kids. But of course, the decision to have children is intensely personal. It’s also one that governments around the world try to influence in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. So I wanted to understand what impact these kinds of personal decisions can have at scale, and why governments have so often tried to influence their citizens when it comes to having children. Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press, exploring new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. So far on the podcast, we’ve looked at a lot of physical infrastructure: housing, transportation, cities, container ships. But why do we need all this infrastructure in the first place? People. It all comes down to people. So, in this episode, we’re looking at how a country’s population, its size, its growth or lack of growth, are perhaps the most critical infrastructure. Along the way, we’ll dig into one of the thorniest questions about populations. What happens when governments try to influence population growth and size through policy? Countries around the world put policies in place that influence their citizens’ reproductive choices. The United Nations Department of World Economic and Social Affairs keeps track of these policies. In 2021, their report listed 143 governments with fertility policies intended to either raise, lower or maintain population size. For example, Kenya has had government-led efforts to slow population growth since the 1960s. These programs, which began by providing basic contraception and family-planning information, evolved into healthcare systems for mothers and infants. By contrast, Hungary has recently made headlines for a distinctly different goal. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has spoken openly about wanting to raise Hungary’s birth rate, which is among the lowest in Europe. In 2015, the Family Housing Allowance Program created subsidies that increased based on whether a couple was married and how many children they had. The most benefits were available to married couples with three or more children. But Hungary has actually had policies in place to raise birth rates since the late 1940s. One country that has tried to both speed up and slow down its population growth through policy is Singapore, first by discouraging citizens from having large families and now by pursuing pro-fertility policies. So with that Mentos ad still ringing in my ears, I set out to understand what it was like to live with these ever-changing policies. How did people having kids in Singapore experience their government’s evolving attitudes towards procreation? Titus: My name is Titus. I’m 69 years old now. I have been in the government service for 25 years with the Housing and Development Board in Singapore. So that’s a little bit about me, and my wife and I, we have three children. Vimala: I’m Vimala and I’ve been a teacher all my life, taught for about 30 years, 35 years. Titus: We’re both born in Singapore and we have lived here for all our lives. Tamara Winter: Titus and Vimala have seen both sides of Singapore’s policy on family planning. Vimala: We lived through the times when we had this policy of “Stop-at-Two” family planning. Tamara Winter: After World War II, Singapore’s population was rising rapidly, much faster than its economy was developing. Even the introduction of family planning in the 1940s didn’t slow it down. In 1950, the population was barely more than one million. But by the time of independence in 1965, it was almost 1.9 million, close to double. Add to that, Singapore is a tiny island nation. It’s just 281 square miles. For comparison, the city of Los Angeles is about 500 square miles. A booming population, little room for expansion. So by the early 1970s, the government took action. Titus: You know, during our teenage years, I think the Stop-at-Two policy started somewhere the early ’70s. Tamara Winter: 1972. Titus: And we were our teenage years at that time. Vimala: No, it was early twenties. Titus: In our twenties, sorry. We were in our twenties at that time. That’s the purpose of the policy, to reeducate you on what is right and then what is wrong. I thought it was quite intuitive as well. One child, the child will be lonely. Two children, okay, he’s got a playmate. Three, if some mistakes are made then you have three. Tamara Winter: The Stop-at-Two policy, a combination of incentives and disincentives for families. Vimala: We got married in 1980. So my first child was born in ‘81, and after I gave birth immediately, I think the next day, the nurse comes to me and asks me, "What plans do you have for family planning?" So it was very strict at that time, and they wanted us to keep at two. So if you stopped at two, you had a lot of incentives. Like, they got us at places where it mattered a lot to us, which was the housing and health. If you had two children, both the children would get X number of dollars in school for them. But if you had a third child, then the third child would have nothing, that sort of thing. Titus: So you had to fund it yourself. Vimala: Yeah. Tamara Winter: Along with the policies came an aggressive PR campaign. Vimala: Maybe it was kind of a propaganda. There were campaigns, and very sadly, you’re told, "Two is enough," and "Because of two, you get X number of things." And so after a while, and we were young at that time, maybe in our late teens, early twenties, and then you start to see that, eh, it makes sense. Actually, I remember this poster very, very vividly in my mind with the father, mother and two daughters. And they say, "Boy or girl, two is enough." Tamara Winter: And those posters were inescapable. Titus: Once you have a government policy, the posters are everywhere, in government offices. Vimala: Bus stops. Titus: Public places, bus stops. Vimala: Yeah. Malls, everywhere. They just have different versions of it, but the idea is the same. Tamara Winter: Some other posters from the time directly promoted more drastic measures like sterilization, calling it "the best method for family limitation." Vimala: So if you stopped at two and if you sterilized yourself, the lady, she could get the best school for her child, whichever school she wanted for her child. And also the family could stay in some of the better areas in Singapore. So it was a very serious thing then, and most people adhered to that policy of "keep at two." Titus: Some of the ladies, actually, were sterilized, though of course, they took the more drastic action to stop at two. Many years later, when the government started encouraging people to have more children, there were some bad feelings that, "You had actually prevented me from having more children and now you’re telling me to have more children." So there were some of these undercurrents. Tamara Winter: So the Stop-at-Two policy in Singapore was more than just economic. Sterilizations took place on a mass scale with a peak of more than 10,000 procedures carried out in 1976. The Stop-at-Two policy was far from the only effort to limit population growth in developing countries. China’s one-child policy, which was put in place in 1980, is probably the most well known, but countries like India also put similar policies in place as far back as the early 1950s. But these kinds of policies often came at a heavy cost. One that has disproportionately impacted women. In Singapore, mothers, afraid they might be unable to bear the costs of a third child, were forced to make permanent, life-altering choices about their bodies. This was also the case on a much larger scale in China. Millions of women were sterilized as part of the government’s efforts at population control. Others were forced to undergo abortions. In some rural areas where there was a long-standing preference for male children, female infants were abandoned. And as a result, in China today it’s estimated that there are nearly 35 million more men than women. In economically-developed countries, the notion of having fewer children by choice gained traction, starting in the late 1960s, sometimes with an environmental argument attached. This anxiety about the world’s growing population was in large part because of one extremely popular book written by a husband-and-wife team. Archived audio Johnny Carson: It was about 10 years ago this month that Dr. Paul Ehrlich made his first appearance on the Tonight Show, and it elicited probably more mail than any guest at that time we have ever had on a show. It had to do with his book, The Population Bomb, and it was a major factor in launching the ZPG, which is zero population growth in this country. And since that show, he’s done about 25 shows with us. Tamara Winter: The Population Bomb, coauthored by Paul and Anne Ehrlich, was a sensation. Published in 1968, it predicted famine, drought and mass death due to overpopulation, all within the next 20 years. These ideas weren’t entirely new. Economist Thomas Malthus made a similar case in his 1798 book, _An Essay on the Principle of Populatio_n. But it was Ehrlich’s writing that brought these concepts to a broad, contemporary audience. Some paperback copies of The Population Bomb carried the typewritten warning, "While you are reading these words, four people will have died from starvation, most of them, children." Ehrlich’s argument, "Let’s make sure that the existing population cannot just survive but thrive before worrying about adding more people to the planet." Here he is in 1980. Archived audio Paul Ehrlich: We have a little over four billion today. Large numbers of them are undernourished. We don’t have enough energy to go around. People think the environment is deteriorating and so on. Why don’t we try doing a really good job with four billion people, see if we can do that? Tamara Winter: The legacy of this book, for better or for worse, lives on today. In 2019, a statement on the need for climate action, endorsed by over 11,000 scientists, was published in the Journal of Bioscience. One of the statements’ recommendations: stop global population growth. Now, the methods of population limitation proposed in this statement were mainly about personal choice, like increasing access to family planning services. They were not advocating restrictive government policies, but the anxieties that Ehrlich brought to mainstream attention are present. So I wanted to know, what is the state of population growth like today? I called up Clara Piano. Clara Piano: Alright. So my name is Clara Piano. I am currently an assistant professor of quantitative analysis at Samford University. My area of research is family economics, although I’ve also published in the history of economic thought and the economics of religion. Tamara Winter: In addition to being an expert on family economics, when we talked, she was also about to become a mom. Clara Piano: Yes, yes. I am eight months along with our first. She’s a little girl, and it has convinced me that no one is ever ready. I just really do feel like it’s been a privilege to not only be researching what I find most interesting, which is how families form and function and interact with society, but to be living it right now as well. Tamara Winter: So I asked her: is the world’s population still growing? Clara Piano: The world’s population is increasing, although much less than it was in the past. Tamara Winter: World population growth reached a peak in the 1960s. Since then, it has fallen. And within the next 100 years, the world’s population is actually projected to shrink. Researchers like Clara are keeping a close eye on these global trends because unlike Erlich, they see potential in a growing population. When we talked, she referenced the work of economist Julian Simon. Clara Piano: As Julian Simon would say, the ultimate resource is people. And of course, there are values of people beyond economics. I want to acknowledge that completely, and he does as well in his work. But basically, it comes down to the fact that people are not only hands. They also have brains and they have ideas, and population growth, even from the economic perspective, is not just a replication process but a diversification process. So the people who are being born now are going to have different ideas of how to do things that will generate technological progress, which is actually the source of economic growth. Tamara Winter: This is another view of population growth also captured by economist Michael Kremer in his 1990 paper, Population Growth and Technological Change. The paper is worth reading in full, but the takeaway is that as populations increase, so does technological advancement, which in turn increases economic growth, and more concretely, raises living standards. So population growth can possibly be a key to solving the existential challenges that Erlich described: like food and energy scarcity, and climate change. The theory goes, if there are more people out there trying to solve big problems, more possible solutions can be found. Shruti Rajagopalan: You live in New York City, right? That’s the greatest example of this. These kinds of places is where progress really quickens, where ideas multiply. That’s what we really need. Tamara Winter: That’s Shruti Rajagopalan. Shruti Rajagopalan: I lead the India policy research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. I’m an economist by training. I also direct the India grants for the Emergent Ventures grants program also at Mercatus. I’m a fellow of the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU Law School because, in another life, I did get a law degree and I work a lot in the field of law and economics. Tamara Winter: Her research on developing economies is rooted in India, a country with a massive and growing population. Shruti Rajagopalan: So India’s population currently stands at 1.35 billion. I know that’s sort of a hard number to even imagine. The United States, for comparison, where we are recording this, is about 330, 340 million people. So the Indian population is 18% of the world. Tamara Winter: India is projected to surpass China as the most populous country in the world within the next decade. While a growing population can put stress on a nation’s infrastructure, Shruti sees India’s numbers as one of its greatest assets. Shruti Rajagopalan: India already has the resources of a large number of people. Now we need to make sure that these people are healthy, that they’re educated, that they’re prosperous, that they can actually go into the ideas part of the economy and bump into each other. The ideas can have sex, and that can become the new engine of growth for not just Indian prosperity, but global prosperity. Because in the future, one in five people joining the workforce, globally, is going to be Indian. Tamara Winter: But not all countries are growing so rapidly, and some aren’t growing at all. So the fundamental question remains: how to ensure that people can have the number of children they want to have. Here’s Clara Piano. Clara Piano: So this is the billion-dollar question. There is an element of mystery about all of this, in terms of the declining populations around the world. However, there are some things that we know. We do know that as people have become more educated, particularly women, we see lower fertility, and this could be a variety of reasons. Some people think it’s better knowledge about family spacing, fertility decisions. I, from an economic perspective, the most compelling reason for me seems to be that just the opportunity of the cost of their time increases. Tamara Winter: With the kinds of economic benefits that Clara and Shruti describe in mind, by the mid 1980s, Singapore was changing its policies. Titus: The reversal in policy to have more children came in 1986. I think. Tamara Winter: It was in 1986 that the policy officially changed. As a snarky headline in the New York Times put it, "Singapore decides it wants lots of children after all." But the policy change didn’t happen overnight. Titus: 1984, the thinking was already quite clear. They started this graduate-mother scheme, graduate-mother policy, where if you are a graduate mother, you get more incentives— Vimala: School, education. Titus: For education for your children, tax incentives, including subsidy for even hiring a foreign maid. These were some of the incentives that were given for graduate mothers to go out and work, and also to have more children. At that time, anyway, there was a belief that smart women produce smart children. Tamara Winter: The shift wasn’t just from Stop-at-Two to, everyone have as many kids as you can. The new policy slogan was: have three or more, if you can afford it. And even then, the government preference was for highly-educated women to be the ones having children. The slogan and program were a little harder to distill in a soundbite than Stop-at-Two. It also had to convince a generation that grew up with Stop-at-Two messaging. Vimala: Among my siblings, we’re the only two who have three kids. All the rest have two. Even my brother, who married twice with each wife, he had two children. So it’s just like, "Oh, that’s the best number. It makes sense." Tamara Winter: When thinking about the intuitive power of Stop-at-Two, Vimala recalls a family night out at a restaurant. Vimala: When I had my second daughter, she kept telling us, "Oh, four of us, that’s just fine." I still remember we were at the restaurant, she said, "You see, there’s a table for four? That’s just nice for us." And so when I told her I was having my third one, she wasn’t happy at all because she felt that was really not the plan. So I think all of us had that in mind. We are very subtle... there’s subtle messages that they sent to us. Tamara Winter: Skeptical parents were only one of the barriers to Singapore’s new policy efforts. Another force was at work, a result of the country’s rapid economic growth over the years that the Stop-at-Two policy was in place. In the field of demography—the study of human populations—one of the major concepts is what’s called the “demographic transition.” This is the name for a phenomenon that has been observed in virtually every country around the world: it describes the shift within a country from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth rates and low death rates. There's an ongoing debate about what exactly causes this transition. Social and economic development—things like improved sanitation and better education, especially for women and girls—are correlated with declining fertility and increased longevity. The result: a more slowly growing population and an aging one, sometimes even one that shrinks. During the 1970s and into the 1980s, Singapore’s economic development was rapid, moving it further along the journey to, you guessed it, demographic transition. Since then, Singapore’s population has continued to grow, but the rate of growth has slowed and is projected to continue falling for the foreseeable future. So what does it mean to have an aging or declining population? Well, for starters the costs of supporting such a population can strain national budgets. And put more financial pressure on younger working-age people to support the elderly. Both individually and through expanding social programs. There’s also quite a lot of evidence that aging populations are less dynamic. And more hostile to new ideas. So as Singapore was going through its own demographic transition, it decided to work against the trend with policies that encouraged fertility. Some thinkers are encouraging economically developed countries to fight the demographic transition. To understand more about why Singapore and other countries are concerned about slowing population growth rates, I called up Matt Yglesias. Matthew Yglesias: I’m Matthew Yglesias. I write a newsletter called Slow Boring. I’m a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center, and I wrote a book recently called One Billion Americans. Tamara Winter: If you’re on Twitter, you probably didn’t need that introduction. The full title of his book is One Billion Americans: The Case For Thinking Bigger. And Yglesias certainly thinks big when it comes to the United States population. Matthew Yglesias: In some way, the population is the most important infrastructure of all. We’re talking about tripling the population density of the United States in this book. That would put us on a par with France. We’d be at about half the density of Germany. Most of the country is not unspoiled wilderness. It just has room for more people in it. Tamara Winter: He argues that a larger population in the United States would be beneficial to more than just technological development. Matthew Yglesias: I think it also matters for innovation and for culture that, part of the strength of the United States is that a lot of people come here to try to pursue their biggest dreams. And that can be technology entrepreneurs. It’s also movie directors. Like, if you do really well in New Zealand cinema, you get to go make a movie in America because we have a big audience, we have a big enterprise here. Tamara Winter: That New Zealand cinema example feels especially on point. Just a week ago, while we were finishing this episode, the biggest movie in the world was Thor: Love and Thunder, directed by Taika Waititi, who got a start making indie movies in New Zealand and had his international breakout with a mockumentary about vampire flatmates in Wellington. Now he’s in Hollywood making Marvel movies and scheduled to write and direct a Star Wars film. In his writing, Yglesias brings up a particular statistic, that many women in the United States end up having fewer children than they say they want. Matthew Yglesias: What’s interesting, though, is that in the ’70s, there was a really big decline in how many children American women said they wanted to have. For the past 20 years, you have not seen that decline in intended fertility, but actual completed fertility has kept ticking downwards. Tamara Winter: Listening to Yglesias, I was reminded that Clara Piano, who we heard from earlier on this episode, made a similar point. Clara Piano: Educated women in developed countries, in particular, have the highest fertility gaps, which essentially means that, although they say when they’re around age 25, "I’d like to have, maybe, three children," on average they end up having two. So that’s a pretty big gap and it’s, for me, a signal that there’s something going on that we don’t really understand. Tamara Winter: So what can governments do? Clara offers an answer that touches on some of the physical infrastructure discussed in previous episodes of this podcast. Clara Piano: At the end of the day, I think that, really, just the best way to think about this is to increase freedom quite literally. Because women and men, in general, are saying, "I would like to have more children." There are some barriers that are preventing them from having children, and so just basic things like increasing economic freedom, labor mobility, freeing up people to fulfill their plans, whether or not that’s economic or for their families. For housing, to be able to move and to increase the supply of housing so we can have rooms for the children. These are more promising approaches. Tamara Winter: So what does this look like in practice? The promising approaches Clara mentions point towards options beyond government policies aimed at directly encouraging or discouraging citizens from having kids. Maybe the problem is that people are being prevented from having the number of children they say they want because of rising costs of living, housing, social support, or any number of other pressures. So while building more housing, further expanding the child tax credit, increasing labor mobility, ensuring paid maternity and paternity leave, and promoting workplace flexibility might not solve every problem—I think they're policies worth pursuing anyway. Back in Singapore, Titus and Vimala ended up having three children. And though their third was born after the Stop-at-Two policy ended, there were still challenges and a lack of support. Vimala: When I had my third child in 1990, I had no maternity leave or whatever. I didn’t get a salary for two months if I decided to go on leave. Tamara Winter: Luckily, they have the kind of financial stability that allowed them to feel comfortable having a third child. Titus: Well, for us, actually, we were about to get married. Our idea was we would have children and, of course, at that time it had been ingrained in us two children. That was proper number to have. Even if we had three, we did not have an issue with that. We had our two children. First child was born in ’81, second one in ’85. And then, five years later, we were blessed with a third daughter. Tamara Winter: Titus and Vimala are both well educated and have stable jobs. The financial incentives and disincentives of the Stop-at-Two and have-three-or-more-if-you-can policies were a part of their lives, but they didn’t have to change their family planning decisions because of them. Today, they have three grown daughters with families of their own. Vimala: My mother was maybe my role model. My mom was a housewife and she worked, she was a very hard-working housewife, so I used her as, "Okay, I want to be a bit like her also." Because I read a lot, I’m a literature teacher, teacher of English and literature, so for me, having three girls, I tried to impart quite a lot of things that I enjoyed in my life to them, like poetry and taking them to plays. Seeing them come full-circle, like having their own families, I think that in itself is a joy. Titus: Yeah. I suppose when they were young, of course, there’s the joy as they developed and progressed. Achievements in school, achievements in other areas of art or whatever. That brings joy to us. And as my wife said, when they found their life partners, you know… Tamara Winter: Reflecting on the various policy programs he’s seen over the last 50 years in Singapore, Titus remains optimistic about the country and the future. Titus: We have lived in a fairly strict country. The standard of living is reasonably good. Salaries are reasonably good. And I think we are quite happy to have been born and living in Singapore. Tamara Winter: And Singapore continues to promote policies that support families that have more children. In 2008, paid maternity leave was increased to 16 weeks. And in 2013, one week of paid paternity leave was added. The government also offers tax breaks, housing subsidies, and even cash payments. Maybe this set of incentives will be enough on its own, or maybe, in 2022, the government will still be looking for all the help it can get and we’ll see a return of the Mentos ad. As we’ve been researching and preparing this episode, I’ve been saying that this one is for the mothers, because when it comes to decisions about having kids, the people who carry them for nine months are often the ones who pay the highest price, physically and economically. And I hope to be one of those people. So while it’s easy to get lost in the economic theory or the global-level demographic statistics, this is personal for me. And so many aspiring parents around the world. And very, very real. The kinds of policies we’ve been talking about in this episode could directly impact my life when I have kids of my own. Vimala didn’t receive paid time off to have her third child. The United States, where I will likely have my children one day, is one of the only industrialized nations that does not have a national standard for paid family leave. But what years of research into the causes of declining fertility rates have demonstrated is that economic policies, even very generous ones, aren’t necessarily enough to move the needle on birth rates. Extended families, communities and other layers of social support also really matter. They certainly did for my family. And at least in my circles, this fact is increasingly acknowledged. Some of my friends are even making concrete plans to raise their children together. So I’m hopeful. Hopeful that there can be policies and social structures in place that ensure everyone has the freedom to make their own independent choices about how, when and with whom to have children.

Original music for Beneath the Surface was composed by Auribus. Visit press.stripe.com to learn more about Stripe Press. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Tamara Winter: Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the most recent episode of the podcast, you heard a brief snippet of my interview with Shruti Rajagopalan. She is a Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center and leads the Indian political economy research program and Emergent Ventures India at Mercatus. In our conversation we discuss not only the economic implications of India’s population growth, but also she gives personal insights into India’s history, sharing some of her experiences growing up in socialist India and witnessing its economic transformation firsthand. So here is my conversation with Shruti Rajagopalan which has been lightly edited. I’m going to have you first introduce yourself and your relevant affiliations. Shruti Rajagopalan: That is relatively easy. I lead the India policy research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. I’m an economist by training. I also direct the India grants for the Emerging Ventures Grants program, also at Mercatus. I’m a Fellow at the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU law school, because in another life, I did get a law degree and I work a lot in the field of law and economics. I host a podcast called the Ideas of India, which is an attempt to bridge the gap between academic ideas and political economy, real world problems in India. And my main area of research is writing about Indian political economy, more specifically, my training is in public choice economics, law and economics, constitutional economics. I’m a very classic George Mason University trained economist. So, that’s all my affiliations, I think. Tamara Winter: Wow, is what I’ll say. Wow. Shruti, I want to start off with some context about India. So, how big is India, both in size and population? And I’m curious, for somebody who doesn’t have an immediate picture of how large India is, how does it compare to the rest of the world? So I think it’s something like 17% of the world’s population? Shruti Rajagopalan: Exactly. So India’s population currently stands at 1.35 billion. I know that’s sort of hard number to even imagine, right. The United States for comparison, where we are recording this, is about 330, 340 million people, right. So, the Indian population is 18% of the world. Having said that, India is a very young country, right. So the median age is about three to four years lower than most developing countries and much lower than the developed Western world, which has an aging population. It’s the second largest country, in terms of population and barring natural disaster or existential risk, nuclear war, asteroid hit, it’s likely to be the most populous country in the world. It’s the sixth largest economy just because the size is so large. I think nominal GDP is about 2.7 trillion US dollars, something like that. Having said that, in terms of GDP per capita, it’s still relatively a low to middle income country. It’s about $2,000 GDP per capita. Just as a point of comparison, China is about 5X the GDP per capita of India. South Korea is about 15X, right. And the United States is about 30X. So, in terms of being rich, it’s great to have a very large country, but it’s even more important that it’s a very large number of people who are also very, very prosperous. Tamara Winter: I actually want to add one more question for context. So, I was born in Nigeria, we’ve talked about this a little bit and I saw a tweet forever ago, basically pointing out the futility of talking about a country like Nigeria as though it were one country, something like 200 different ethnic groups within the country. And I wonder to what extent is this also true of India? Shruti Rajagopalan: Absolutely. I mean, I think Nigeria and India are great examples of this kind of diversity, but also how difficult it is to paint the country in one color. So just as an example, Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest state in India, it’s the size of Brazil. The smallest state in India, Sikkim, is closer to the size of Bhutan, which is like a really small Himalayan Kingdom country, right. India’s richest states like Goa, which is a great place. All the tourists love to go to Goa. It has a GDP per capita closer to Jordan, right. And India’s poorer state, Bihar is closer to Haiti. So, that’s basically the difference, right. And there are some Southern states like Kerala, which have...great on human indicators, 100% literacy rates. Again, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which are relatively poor, they’re barely at the halfway mark. And in terms of linguistic diversity, there are 18 or 19 official languages, but they’re technically thousands of dialects. Very similar to Nigeria in this sense. The caste system is another point of fragmentation. There’s a lot of religious fragmentation, of course. Hindus are the majority in terms of population, about 83%, but it’s about 13, 14% Muslims, right. It’s one of the largest Islamic countries in terms of absolute numbers. I think it’s the second largest. So, in terms of religious diversity, caste diversity, ethnic diversity, it’s really, really big. You’d love this, the Cambridge economist, Joan Robinson, she once said that, "The frustrating thing about India is whatever you can rightly say about India, the opposite is also true." And I think this is really true also of Nigeria, in the sense, right. Anything you can say about one tribe, you can get the exact opposite example in another end of the country in a different state, in a different city. So I think that point is very well taken. So India, when we say...it’s just, I’m talking about a geographical boundary and a state entity and a certain kind of common culture, a democratic framework, those are things that hold Indians together, but you’re right. We got to get specific really quickly with countries like India. Tamara Winter: Well, now that we’ve said that, we’re going to zoom back out then. For anybody who hasn’t read How India Can Use Its Numbers, your excellent article, could you maybe summarize the argument and tell folks the context in which it appeared? Shruti Rajagopalan: I grew up in socialist India and at that time, the economic rates of growth were relatively low, but population was growing really quickly, because post World War II, with all the advances in medicine and infectious diseases or battling infectious diseases, suddenly you saw infant mortality drop, you saw people living much longer lives. There’s this huge boom in population. But if the size of the economic pie is not growing, it means you’re basically redistributing the same size of the pie with more and more people. So in this context, it becomes very easy to have a Malthusian point of view, which is people are the problem, right. Wherever you look, you think in terms of zero sum games, because that’s how socialist economies operate. There isn’t a positive sumness that comes from create and openness, but also, all the infrastructure is crumbling, right. There are too many people. Every time you need to get on a bus, you see that you got to elbow 15 people to even get on a bus, right. Or school admissions, right. Every single basic public service that you use, whether it’s roads congestion, whether it’s water runs out the moment you go to the public well or the public tap. So these kinds of problems led people to blame population and the government intervened in so many different ways. At one point, even policy called for sterilizations during the undemocratic time of the emergency. But usually, more benign ways of essentially reducing the population, right. And this has led to, I think, a basic misconception. We need to bring the focus back now that India has liberalized and now it’s actually a trading economy, it’s plugged into the global economy, that more people are actually a good thing, right. So as Julian Simon said that, "People are the ultimate resource." right. And why do we think people are the ultimate resource? I think that’s the insight which is a little bit harder for people who come from the Malthusian point of view. And this comes to why or where we think economic growth comes from, right. And it’s not coming from just more physical resources. Economic growth comes from new ideas. Tamara Winter: We take for granted the idea that having a large population is beneficial. You and I are doing this interview in the United States. You’re from India, I’m from Nigeria. So I’ll ask you directly, why is having a large population beneficial? Shruti Rajagopalan: This is a great question and it’s unintuitive to most people, right. Because most people just think, "Oh, there are more mouths to feed," right. Especially in socialist economies or developing countries, but economists and more and more economists who worked on growth theories, whether it’s Paul Romer or Michael Kremer, right. Their idea is that the central or the key to economic growth is new ideas, right. New ideas are more important than just some form of capital, physical capital or labor or something else, right. Once you recognize the power of ideas, the value of the population comes into focus, right. People, especially well educated people, healthy populations, smart, creative people in a space where they’re constantly bumping into each other, are the source of not just new ideas, but also how to combine these new ideas into more and more and more applications and that is really where economic growth comes from. And this is not just true of today’s tech economy or Silicon Valley or something very specific, right. Michael Kremer has this great paper, it’s called Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990. This is a generalized trend for all of human history. And you can even see this, you go to small island countries for tourism or something like that, you’ve seen that these populations can tend to stagnate. They need outside people to come in and trade with them all the time, otherwise they do stagnate, right. Whereas large connected populations, you live in New York City, right. That’s the greatest example of this. These kinds of places is where progress really quickens, right. Where ideas multiply. Matt Ridley has a great phrase, he says, "Where ideas can have sex," right. That’s what we really need, right. So now fortunately, India already has the resources of a large number of people, right. Now, we need to make sure that these people are healthy, that they’re educated, that they’re prosperous, that they can actually go into the ideas part of the economy and bump into each other, their ideas can have sex, and that can become the new engine of growth for not just Indian prosperity, but global prosperity. Because in the future, one in five people joining the workforce globally is going to be Indian. Tamara Winter: Shruti, in your article, you identified, I think it was three policy areas in which a large population could, if utilized well or if allowed to flourish, could really unlock other gains. What were those policy areas? Shruti Rajagopalan: Yeah, so I’ll tell you a little bit about India before jumping into the policy prescription, because I think it’s important to also specify the problem. So, as I said, the people exist in India, right. And India thankfully, is a democratic country with free movement, so that is a wonderful thing, unlike China, right. That’s the closest example of a country which has large numbers of people, but they’re not allowed free movement, free assembly and so on. But in India, there are a few really major problems. The first is that India’s internal market is completely fragmented. One of the reasons the United States has been such a huge economic success is the United States was one of the first and largest free trade zones. You can trade anywhere within the United States. That never quite happened for India because states had a lot of different taxation regimes. They used to have internal tariff regimes. If you’re shipping apples or banana chips from one state to another state, you have to not only pay tariffs and taxes, but the differential tariffs and taxes come with a lot of corruption, long lines at highways where bureaucrats and corrupt inspectors can extract lots of bribes from you. That was the economy, and that naturally fragments the economy into smaller and smaller parts. And the greatest losers in this are obviously the poorer states, right. Because they’re kind of getting cut out of the market. So the number one thing is how to make sure that India’s internal market stays unified. So for this, the Indian government already took one step, which is unifying the tax regime, right, from this splintered, many-state system to a unified value added tax, it’s called the goods and services tax, but they did it the Indian way. It has eight different tax rates. It’s very complex, it’s a complete mess. So, if they streamline that, that’s going to be a huge improvement. India also needs far better infrastructure and this is where the good news is. We know that if India unifies a single market, there’s going to be so much more trade and therefore, so much more revenue for the government that actually, the additional infrastructure is just going to pay for itself, right. It’s not a net loss to build more roads, right. Or to build more ports or railways and transportation systems, coal storage, warehousing. These are things that will pay for themselves, so that’s one major part of it. The second is India’s labor market is a complete disaster, right. And this is, again, goes back to the socialist history of...there are just about, I think 40 or 50 federal level labor laws and regulation, and every state has its own rules and own regulation, which means at any given point, if you’re a countrywide firm, you have to follow 200, 300 different codes of regulation. And there’s a labor inspection system, which is of course, very corrupt and can completely extract rents, but what that does is it makes it very costly to hire people in a labor surplus economy, which is a terrible, terrible thing. And therefore, and you’ll be familiar with this from the Nigerian experience, it gets pushed into the informal market. And what I mean by the informal market is that it’s basically just escaping taxes and regulation, right. There’s nothing poor quality of the informal market. My engagement ring, I’m showing it to Tammy right now, comes from the informal market, right. So you can have very high quality, very, very expensive jewelry, leather goods, artwork, all this manufacturing happening in the shadow of India’s regulation. And what that does is it doesn’t allow it to scale, right. When things can’t formalize, they can’t get access to credit. And more importantly, in the labor market, people can’t get gainfully employed in sensible jobs that are salaried. They’re basically working daily wage labor, right. So this really needs to get fixed. 80% of India works in the informal economy. So they need to be brought back in a way out of the shadows, into the light. And the only way to do that is to deregulate in a meaningful way, countrywide, so that it becomes very easy to hire labor and it becomes very easy for actually people to invest and develop their skills. And the third thing is India, for its state of development, got connected to the internet, right, very, very quickly. This has again, got something to do with its numbers, right. When you need to lay the pipes, right. Or to put down the infrastructure for internet or telecom connectivity, a very large size market helps, right. Because very large number of subscribers means that you can put in the capital expenditure required to lay the pipes. So in India, that happened really quickly. I believe 816 million people are connected to a mobile phone in India. So it has fantastic mobile phone penetration. I think three out of four households has at least one phone. So the household has access. And that means that...and data is so cheap in India that I believe at one point someone was telling me, I met someone who used to work at HBO and they told me that Game of Thrones is super popular in India, though, it never launched by then. Everyone was watching it on torrent or something because data and streaming is so cheap in India that HBO decided that, "Okay, this is a very large market. We need to simultaneously start releasing this in India because there’s this huge fan base." So I think because India got connected, a lot of the network goods as we call them, this is platforms, right. Especially...I mean, you work at Stripe, so you completely understand what I’m talking about, but even more basic, like Twitter, Facebook, any kind of platform good, Uber, all this has a massive market potentially in India, right. People should get used to how you and I speak because more and more stuff on Netflix is going to sound like you and me, right. Because that’s where the eyeballs are going to come from in the future. So I think this is an underappreciated insight and for some things, you just need more eyeballs, right. For things like subscription services, for things like Twitter. For some things, you also need purchasing power. So as India gets richer, then more people are also going to use Stripe Press, right. Not just Stripe, right. As India gets more educated. So I think this is an insight that’s really valuable. So these are three areas where massive amount of investment is going to help India in a meaningful way. Tamara Winter: I’m curious about the 1991 reforms in India and what effect they had on the Indian economy. Shruti Rajagopalan: Oh, this is great question and my current passion project. So, I should plug this because we run a project called the 1991 Project at the Mercatus Center right now. It started last year in July on the 30th anniversary of the reforms and the website is the1991project.com. So basically, India was a socialist economy and was increasingly growing more and more socialist, since let’s say about World War II until 1990. That meant that India was basically hugely impoverished, right. And there were years or decades when the rate of economic growth didn’t even keep up with population growth, right. So there were years of negative GDP per capita growth. And this was obviously not sustainable, but in the late ’80s and early ’90s, what actually brought the country to crisis was a balance of payments problem, right. India simply did not have enough currency to afford its huge imports, especially its oil imports and energy imports, and it didn’t export enough, right. It didn’t have enough foreign exchange. So it was this crazy economy where a lot of short term debt and ballooning interest payments, which could basically topple the currency and therefore, in a meaningful way, bring down macroeconomic stability. So something had to be done. And those years, the IMF and World Bank used to have something called the Washington Consensus and they would have this long list of prescriptions for countries who were going through this macroeconomic crisis. We’ve known about this in the East Asian countries or Latin American countries. India had had similar talks and exchanges before with the World Bank and IMF when this didn’t succeed, but in 1991, something very curious and interesting had happened. A lot of the people who were in the Indian government at that time had gone and seen the growth miracle in South Korea, in Taiwan, in Singapore, right. They had been to Western countries. They had worked at the World Bank and IMF as technocrats. They had studied in American universities and they brought back this idea that, "Hang on, markets and trade are not such a terrible thing." So there was a major shift away from these hard entrant socialist values towards, "We need to open up trade." So what India did in 1991, I’ll give you the Cliff Notes version and those who are deeply interested can go to the website, is it reduced import tariffs, it devalued its currency, right, in a meaningful way, and when I say reduced import tariffs, I mean, some of the average rate of tariffs was I think 155% and the highest tariff rate was over 350%, right. So it started bringing those down in a sensible way, so now people could actually import, and this is again, not so intuitive. If you can import better, you can export cheaper, because your imports just became more efficient and higher quality and so on. So India’s total, entire chunk of trade as a part of GDP started increasing. India started getting richer. But on the other hand, another major reform that happened was India had crazy industrial licensing. The kinds that you read in economic textbooks that are talking about the socialist calculation problem. The Indian Planning Commission would tell its industrialists or entrepreneurs, how many bicycles they can produce, how many Vespas they can produce, right. How much paper can be produced or printed in a given year? So this import controlled economy where they were told what they can produce basically became a shortages scarcity economy, right. Long lines for everything. Overnight, industrial licensing was completely eliminated in India by end of July 1991, except a few select industries where they controlled some things. This basically...I mean, now you say that, "Oh, you can produce as many bicycles as people are willing to buy?" And you can imagine the gains that just unleashes, right. So these were some of the reforms that happened that brought India out of a very strictly controlled economy, internally and externally, and integrated it to the global market. And I’m a huge beneficiary of it. At the time, I was seven, eight years old when the reforms happen and overnight, I went from choice between two chocolate brands, which weren’t even that good, now there were dozens of different kinds of chocolates I could eat, right. And Michael Jackson, who my sister adored and I adored, used to drink Pepsi, and now, we could get a Michael Jackson CD, right. We could buy a CD player and we could get Pepsi, which is what he used to drink. So my memory of liberalization is also very visceral, right. Even as a kid, I knew that something major’s happening and my life is so much better. Of course, I come from a very privileged, upper middle class background, but for poorer people, it meant shortages and lines went away. When they’re standing in line for their rations, now they’re no longer getting terrible quality. Now, they’re actually getting good quality rations or they’re getting better t-shirts to wear because they were imported from China or Taiwan, right. I mean their clothing bill just got cheaper, when people are very poor, that matters. So at every level, right. It brought this huge change in India and we’re working on a year long project. We are recording oral histories with technocrats. We’re trying to understand why these ideas changed. We’re trying to show the growth that it unleashed. India went from an economy that was growing at 3% or 4% to an economy that eventually started growing at 7, 8%. And for 25 years, India grew...sustained at about 6 to 7% on average per annum, and it has lifted 270 million people out of poverty, right. That’s the size of...it’s like creating a new prosperous country almost, right. That’s an extraordinary achievement. So, I think the 1991 reforms, after Indian independence from colonial powers, if there is one major thing that’s happened in India to make everyone’s life better, globally and for Indians, it would probably be that moment. Tamara Winter: I mean, that’s incredible and I encourage anybody listening to go to the 1991 Project and also, to keep following your work. Could you speak a little bit more to how the Indian government reacted to perceived overpopulation? Shruti Rajagopalan: Absolutely. So, it started in a benign way, right. It initially started with education programs. We need to tell people to have fewer kids and that sort of thing. And a lot of those educational programs were linked to women’s health, right. This is a huge stress on women, right. This kind of reproductive stress. Then, there were campaigns that encouraged more people to adopt birth control or use condoms and things like that, right. So at that stage, and this is all pre-AIDS, right. So this is not use condoms for safer sex, this is use condoms to birth fewer children, right. So this was what was going on in the heyday of socialism under Mrs. Indira Gandhi, who was then prime minister, at one point, India suddenly moved from a democratic to an authoritarian regime for about 22 months. This was the famous episode of the Indian emergency. So India called a national level emergency and civil liberties were completely disrupted or no longer guaranteed and the government became very oppressive, right. The entire opposition of India was jailed. One of the major policy programs at that time, which her son initiated in her name, was for sterilization. And they would just capture young men, young military age men, peak reproductive age rather, and they would take them away to these clinics and make them forcibly have this procedure. So it was just crazy for a little while, right. And it was obviously a hugely unpopular move. It went away immediately after the emergency. India has never done anything that terrible since the late 70s, but it did happen. Now, I want to talk for a minute about some of the unintended consequences. So in a poor country, which has a relatively high birth rate or fertility rate, and this is mixed with very high son preference, right. Culturally, countries like India and many countries in Africa too, including Nigeria, son preference. I mean, this is not uniform, but there are parts of Nigeria, there are parts of India where son preference is incredibly high. So not only should India have more people, it should have a lot more women. So this is one of the unintended consequences. I think this as a policy regime, has now been...it’s gone completely out of vogue. It comes up, some politicians will bring it up. In Uttar Pradesh recently, they said, "Oh, we need to limit to two children." Something like that, but this is no longer a major war cry of the socialist era. And I think there has been a lot of learning from China’s forced one child policy and how now it has this aging demographic that can’t quite carry...the next generation can’t quite carry the weight of this skewed demographic that’s going to age. So I think that is a learning globally, that you need to walk away from these very strict population control policies and I think India’s learned something from it. Tamara Winter: I just have two more questions because I know I’ve taken a lot of your time. To what extent does immigration matter for India, whether that’s in-migration or emigration? Shruti Rajagopalan: I think hugely. Indian diaspora does incredibly well abroad, right. And I mean, America’s a great example of this. There’s a fantastic book by Devesh Kapur and Sanjoy Chakravorty, it’s called The Other One Percent, right. And it’s basically talk about how the Indian diaspora in the United States is one of the most high performing groups anywhere, even within the States or anywhere in the world, right. So in terms of outmigration, Indians have done very, very well abroad and they have assimilated very well in a lot of different cultures. I think that really matters, right. That there is a group of people who are entrepreneurial, who are well educated and are syncretic and who can assimilate. In terms of in-migration, India’s neighboring countries, depending on which neighbor, may or may not have porous borders, right. So with Bangladesh, it’s a very porous border. In fact, there are millions of daily wage workers who cross the border, work in India and go back. Now, this is going to be lesser and lesser of a phenomenon, because I believe Bangladesh’s GDP per capita just overtook India’s, right. So as Bangladesh gets richer, we are not going to have an in-migration issue with daily wage labor, it might even be out. It might be Indians crossing the border to go to Bangladesh to look for work. In terms, but a lot of the borders are very, very strict, because it borders with China and there are conflict areas or it borders with Pakistan, which has been a very long running conflict area. So because of that, you don’t have this foot movement across borders, but India for all practical purposes has a pretty open immigration regime. It’s just a question of who would wish to come and work in India and naturally assimilate in that environment. So, it has to be someone who is...it’s very easy for someone who is English speaking, relatively elite, gets very easily plugged into the formal part of the economy. It’s quite easy to move to India and immediately find work and things like that. And India has so many examples of people coming in as BBC reporters and just staying back, right. Because they’ve assimilated almost too well. On the other hand, if you are looking to come from some of the poorer parts of Asia or Africa, it can be difficult to integrate into a country if you don’t know the lingua franca, and India is so specific in terms of its caste and religious and linguistic relationships that it’s not easy for outside groups to just immediately mingle on say, a factory floor or just come and buy agricultural land and become a farmer or something like that. So, the very typical migration that you see from an even poorer country in India to come to India and start picking cotton or something like that, you don’t see much of that happening in India. And as a percentage of population, it’s a blip. India has just got so many people that migration is not the route that changes numbers, meaningfully. Tamara Winter: One, I appreciate so much that you took the time and we’re both optimists, I think, and I wonder, to close this conversation out, what are, to your mind, the most potent reasons for optimism about India’s future? Shruti Rajagopalan: Lots and lots of people, right. And lots and lots of people who are getting better and better and get integrated into the global economy. And this is because of India’s own regime of relatively free speech, democratic systems and access to the internet. So, I should give you this example. Recently, I like collecting a lot of Indian art, especially tribal art. I bought a particular piece of art, it’s made on textile. It’s called Mata ni Pachedi. I can send you the picture and it’s by a wonderful artist called Sanjay Chitara. I hope I’m saying his name right, and he’s from Gujarat and it was...I mean, he’s basically vegetable dye on textile and it was sold on an online auction platform. I bought it sitting in a Washington, DC suburb and the payments were processed by Stripe, right. And so, this kind of integration has now made an artist who works on folk art in India so much richer because we have been able to connect with him and there’s massive gains from trade. Those are the sorts of things that make me incredibly optimistic about India. I think what is preventing India from reaching its full potential is basically, very poor regulation, bad government regulation. Government just needs to get out of the way and let Indians be entrepreneurial. And the second is just very poor health and education systems, which always...I think that really hampers people from reaching their full potential, right. How many wonderful artists and Einsteins and Mozarts and geniuses are hiding in India because they are not plugged into the global network, either because they couldn’t access education or they’re not healthy enough, or they’re not rich enough to afford a phone and an internet connection and so on, right. So I think those are the things, if India can manage to fix, I’m just very, very optimistic about its future, but most importantly, because of its numbers. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. We had additional editing support from Emma Jackson. Original music for the series was composed by Auribus. Visit press.stripe.com to learn more about Stripe Press. That’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. B-Sides. Tamara Winter: Hello, and welcome to the final episode of season one of Beneath the Surface. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. Over the course of six episodes, we’ve traveled the world from London to Lusaka, from the Salton Sea to Singapore and talked to infrastructure experts and visionaries who are all working to find creative solutions to some of the biggest problems facing their communities and the world. So it’s not surprising that, well, we have a lot more information than can fit into the episodes we made. So today I’m sitting down with my friend and colleague Everett Katigbak. He’s the series producer for Beneath the Surface. You might remember him from episode two, when we visited his family’s plot of land near California’s Salton Sea. Together, we revisited each episode discussing some of the clips, characters, and stories that got left on the cutting room floor. We also got to talking about some of the big themes and episode ideas that we’ve been sitting on, ones that might make for an interesting season two, possibly a video spinoff? But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. For now, I hope you enjoy this look beneath the surface of Beneath the Surface. Everett Katigbak: Well, today we’re back in the studio talking about some of our highlights and lowlights and all the interesting things in between, our experiences in producing Beneath the Surface. Tammy just tracked the final episode, and now we’re just kind of reflecting on some of our learnings from it. Tamara Winter: I also wonder how many times we can say "beneath the surface" in this conversation, take a shot of oat milk every time. Everett Katigbak: So, Tammy, obviously we’ve kind of learned a lot through digging into these various topics, but maybe we can start at the top. The first episode was very kind of close to you, near and dear. And you have a lot of firsthand experience. What has happened in Zambia or what have we kind of just learned in Lusaka and in Nkwashi since we launched that first episode? Tamara Winter: I think what was particularly exciting about that episode, and I think for a lot of this series is that the stuff that we talked about is happening in real time. And that is very much the case with Nkwashi. So actually this week, as we speak and sit here in San Francisco, Mwiya and several other entrepreneurs are hosting the African Union and they are talking about just interesting ideas around trade and development and economic growth. And so I’m sad we couldn’t be there. But Nkwashi itself too, it’s amazing to see people move in. The residents of Nkwashi starting to kind of identify with the city and post about it. I think one of the things that was particularly interesting about that episode is that there’s a growth story within a growth story within a growth story. So we’re talking about a city in Zambia and then beyond that, we’re also talking about what it hopes to enable, which is like a really robust and flourishing technological ecosystem. So since that episode Nkwashi’s grown. There are, it seems like new interesting companies popping up, not just in Zambia, but across the continent, like every five minutes. So I’m optimistic. Everett Katigbak: It was really great kind of going from a place like Zambia and Nkwashi and then kind of bringing that somewhat closer to home. Obviously Salton Sea, was really kind of personal for me, but the most kind of exciting moment that I had there was actually spending time in Slab City and East Jesus and getting to meet a lot of the people that live off the grid there. And actually kind of realizing ultimately infrastructure is about supporting people. It’s the thing that kind of supports a lot of these different communities and lifestyles. Tamara Winter: More broadly, one thing I enjoyed about the Salton Sea episode, I think we could probably do a whole series on places that were, and then are now starting to come back. I mean, I don’t know that Salton Sea was ever on top necessarily, but it’s pretty striking that it went from being sort of the next Palm Springs to like an asthma machine. And so yeah, that could probably be its own series. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, it was interesting when, when we were there, I actually do recall quite a few like luxury cars, like Audis and BMWs driving around and exploring the area. And I can’t tell if they were just kind of extending their Palm Desert vacay or if they were genuinely looking at it from a developer’s perspective, because land can be had for pennies on the dollar there. But maybe there is kind of this thought that lithium is kind of permeating through the community and the people are starting to look at it as more of an investment. So it was really fascinating to see some of that going on. Tamara Winter: Yeah. And it just seemed like the conversation around Salton Sea is very much live. So I’m optimistic. I’m interested to see how GM kind of makes good on its commitment to have all electric vehicles by 2035. I’m interested to see what Tesla does there, what Ford does there. It’s going to be a place to watch, particularly if the Controlled Thermal Resources team can manage to make a breakthrough with the way that lithium is extracted. You’ll hear me say this a lot in this episode, I’m just very optimistic. Supply chains. Everett Katigbak: We talked a lot about, I think supply chains was probably the first episode that we really knew that we wanted to try and tackle this thing, not only because of how it’s been exacerbated by COVID, but also because I think the shipping container as a unit of measurement and as a metaphor and as an example for efficiency, actually gets kind of thrown around quite a bit in the industries and circles that we talk about. But just seeing you and Ryan Petersen interact was really fascinating. And seeing him kind of naturally dig into some of the storylines and the narratives that we talk about things like trade routes, historic trade routes, the Silk Road and how that was not only responsible for trading of goods, but also this kind of cultural transmission and how that shaped a lot of the people. You could almost see it as a cultural gradient throughout broader Asia and the Eastern Europe continent. So, that was really great. Tamara Winter: I think what was particularly interesting about this episode is that Ryan, it’s funny, he’s running one of the biggest companies in the world that’s focused on global trade. Despite the size of the company that Ryan is running, he had such a ground floor view of the acute challenges that the US, and kind of more specifically California, and even more specifically the port of Long Beach were facing. The thought to just like literally go out to the port and talk to some of the union workers and bring tacos. Everett Katigbak: Right. Tamara Winter: And literally just get people talking about what exactly was keeping people’s stuff so backed up was interesting. And it turns out that even though that was such a triumphant moment, when Ryan was able to help the city and really the state get that port up and running, there are still kind of persistent supply chain challenges. Everett Katigbak: Yeah. I remember, I think we had to rewrite some of the intros and some of the narrative bits to hear mainly because it was changing so rapidly. And I think when we first conceived the episode, things weren’t as congested in the ports. And then ultimately by the time we recorded, I remember going out to Malibu and seeing this long stretch of backed up cargo ships. And that was something I’d never seen. I’ve seen it in port towns, like maybe Singapore or Asia, but never on the California coast. So that was kind of mind blowing to actually visualize it. Housing, because a lot of it was Ben Southwood. I actually thought it was great seeing Ben Southwood in his natural element. When we were out there recently, I got to walk around with Ben and he’s just like a natural encyclopedic kind of tour guide, just hearing him point out very obscure, but also fascinating things about, "Look at this building. This brick pattern is because of this. And this is how it affects the building structurally." And going into ancient Rome and Londinium, and this was all within like a three block radius. So I really enjoyed kind of hearing him talk with the Haredi Jews, because they were able to kind of speak the same language, but also from very different perspectives, which was really fascinating. Tamara Winter: We knew we wanted to do something on housing, but the conversation around housing, why we don’t have enough of it, why it’s so expensive for me has gotten just extremely stale. And so it was really nice to see a very interesting community and maybe not necessarily the first one that you would think of being on the front lines of upzoning and really doing something about the astronomical rises in the cost of housing. So I really enjoyed personally, just learning about how Motty and Shmuel and the rest of the community were able to kind of solve their own problem. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, I guess that is one of the kind of things that changed even in the short time, since we launched this episode. I think we’re originally looking at it from a buyer’s perspective, looking at the markets, but then when you start looking abroad and realizing that even things like zoning, these are the things that are really impacting housing costs. And ultimately, what ties to the whole series together, I think it goes back to what a lot of things that Ryan Petersen was talking about, building materials and supply chains are also exacerbating housing inventory and things like that. One thing that I also started to see as a series unfolded was how all of these seemingly disparate topics were kind of connected through supply chain and infrastructure, ultimately. Tamara Winter: One thing I particularly appreciated about that episode was that I think sometimes with infrastructure, it can be such a big topic. It’s something that everybody needs, but it also has a ton of different stakeholders and the costs of infrastructure don’t necessarily always present themselves immediately. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, and it was really great to see. I mean, a topic like housing, there’s so many different vectors that can influence the ways that things like laws and zoning and ultimately building go. And this was a good example of them working with the municipalities local kind of government to retain the kind of historical sense of the area, but also kind of to address their cultural needs. Oh, transit was a great one. It was actually great to see kind of Tammy exploring her new surroundings out in New York City. In the episode she started off being a Dallas born and bred person, but moving to both places like San Francisco and New York that actually heavily rely on public transit. It was also really fascinating again, since we recorded and shipped this episode, there’s actually been some progress with bullet trains out in the Dallas and in the broader Texas area. So I’m wondering how that impacts you and your relationship with your kind of home base. Tamara Winter: Yeah. My sister texted me about that news. She loved the transit episode. So I’m from Dallas. My sister is in school in San Antonio right now. And so she was extremely excited about the bullet train. And I think people in Texas, I mean, that project has just made a ton of sense for a long time. So Texas I’m rooting for you. We started the housing episode talking about the fact that I had lived in San Francisco, DC and New York and kind of my experiences with renting in each of those cities. But the transit one is almost as striking, right? So each of those cities is very walkable, but the experience of taking transit and getting from point A to point B there is just very different. But I knew that I wanted to do an episode kind of as a thank you or a love letter or a like, thanks for welcoming me to New York. So it was really exciting to kind of explore the Upper East Side, to see the actual Second Avenue subway line in action. But it was just incredible listening to people talk about Japan and London and just other cities. I think what’s particularly striking about transit, even though it’s extremely difficult. It’s multifaceted. They’re all different agencies. There are like labor issues. There’s like what the public wants and will allow in their backyards. All of these things end up being impediments to transit. And yet some countries and cities still manage to get it done. Everett Katigbak: You know what, one thing that I observed, even in the kind of very few times that I’ve ridden Japanese trains, it is like quite a user-centric experience. I think it integrates very well into the landscape. It kind of connects this kind of futurist vision that people have of Tokyo and this kind of ancient historic version of Kyoto and the broader area. And it’s not a destructive process. Oftentimes we think of building trains, especially in the United States, it means that we have to tear down or retrofit something that’s historic, and it does change the landscape and make it look and feel different. But in Tokyo, these layers are able to exist in a way that I think is actually, I don’t know, it preserves their cultural history, but it also kind of projects Japan as this very futuristic and forward thinking place. Tamara Winter: Population. I mean, this is the episode that I was most excited about. This is the one I knew I wanted to make no matter if we made any other episode, because I don’t have any special love for buildings and trains and roads. It’s all useful insofar as it serves people. And so I think questions and population are just fascinating. I mean, years ago I got really interested in birthright trends in the first place and what governments were doing about it. And so you could probably sit for hours and just go down a non-stop list of downright comical things that governments are trying to do to address what they perceive to be the sort of big challenges of having an aging population. And so it’s everything from, we talk about Singapore in the episode. What we don’t talk about is like the time that some of their train stations had literal cartoon eggs on the floor, reminding women that they only had like a finite number of eggs, to Italy’s fertility day to the classic Australian campaign, 40 is the new 20, except if you want to have children. And so I was interested in moving beyond the kind of friendly cringe shaming of women and their sort of expanded choices about rearing families and to really kind of observe how people make decisions about fertility. Everett Katigbak: Yeah. It’s really interesting to see how Singapore kind of uses that lever or kind of turns that dial almost the way that we do here in the States with interest rates and things to kind of really stimulate or catalyze the economy because they’re kind of trying to envision 10, 20 years down the road, what the populace is going to do and how they’re going to impact all these things there. But ultimately, it does come down to like people and human capital as the main driver of economy because that’s why we do and make and build the things that we do is ultimately to kind of support and service people and human’s needs Tamara Winter: This episode, I was both very excited about, and that made me kind of uncomfortable because it turns human beings into kind of these fungible widgets that you can just kind of like turn on if you need more and turn off if you need fewer. It’s the one episode again, that I was kind of the most excited about going into it. And it’s also the one that I have the most questions, regrets. I don’t know what you would call that about. There are lots of things within population that are interesting. Decades ago, South Korea had a gender ratio that was like India’s. A lot more men than women due to a lot of like sex selective abortions and kind of social pressures to have more sons. And today their gender ratio is more like Canada’s. How does that happen? That’s a whole story in and of itself. And that right there may be the story of the series. That within every episode there was a thread that we barely got to pull. That could be an entire story in and of itself. It has been such a joy to work on this series, to sit down with climate scientists, population researchers, train nerds, housing analysts, and city builders, and to reflect on how all our lives are shaped by the infrastructure we build. If there were any questions that came up for you while you were listening to the series or just to this episode, let us know. The world of infrastructure is vast. And even though we’ve gone beneath the surface of six facets of it, I feel like in a lot of ways, we’ve only begun to scratch the surface. So get in touch with us. You can send an email to stripepress@stripe.com or you can tweet us at @StripePress or @_TamaraWinter. Well, you’ve heard me say it at the end of every episode, but Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. And since this is the last episode of season one, let me tell you a little bit more about Stripe Press. Our mission is to spread ideas for progress. So we publish books, produce movies, and yes, make podcasts all about people working for progress. One book that we recently released is Pieces of the Action by Vannevar Bush, which was originally published in 1970. For anyone who doesn’t know, he’s the guy who basically founded the National Science Foundation. This book is his account of working as the architect and administrator of an R&D pipeline that efficiently coordinated the work of civilian scientists and the military during World War II. He was central to catalyzing the development of radar and the proximity fuse, the mass production of penicillin and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. You can find out more about Stripe Press, the books we publish, the movies we produce, and yes, even the other episodes of this podcast at press.stripe.com. The senior producers for season one up Beneath the Surface are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Original music for Beneath the Surface was composed by Auribus. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface.

Title: Stewart Brand – Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One
URL: https://press.stripe.com/maintenance-part-one
Time Published: 2026-01-20T19:01:30Z
Full Content:
The first in a multi-volume work, Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One offers a comprehensive overview of the civilizational importance of maintenance. The book explores the insights that can be gleaned from the maintenance of sailboats, vehicles, and weapons, with absorbing detours into the evolution of precision in manufacturing, the enduring importance of manuals, sustainment in the military, and the never-ending battle against corrosion. Maintenance: Of Everything is a wide-ranging and provocative call to expand what we mean by “maintenance.” It invites us to understand not only the profound impact maintenance has on our daily lives but also why taking responsibility for maintaining something—whether a motorcycle, a monument, or our planet—can be a radical act. Stewart Brand is the cofounder and president of The Long Now Foundation. He created and edited the National Book Award-winning Whole Earth Catalog from 1968 to 1998. His books include The Media Lab (1987), How Buildings Learn (1994), The Clock of the Long Now (1999), and Whole Earth Discipline (2009). He was the subject of the documentary We Are As Gods (2020). Stewart Brand makes a persuasive case that keeping the human show on the road through well-planned maintenance is as vital and as fascinating a task as innovation and discovery themselves. A deliciously good book. Matt Ridley author of The Rational Optimist Once again, Stewart Brand reframes our worldview with a new perspective. You may not imagine you would be interested in rust, Soviet tanks, or tricked-out Model Ts—that is, until Brand reexamines them through the lens of maintenance. Maintenance: Of Everything is destined to be a classic. Danny Hillis cofounder of Applied Invention Stewart Brand is back with a manifesto on maintenance, the tool that empowers all tools. Preventative maintenance, deferred maintenance, and emergency maintenance: this much-needed, no-nonsense treatise illuminates the difference, and why it counts. George Dyson author of Darwin Among the Machines and Turing’s Cathedral Civilization is maintenance. No one else but Stewart Brand is talking about the art and science of maintenance and how to do it well. This will be an instant classic. Kevin Kelly founding executive editor of Wired Brand masterfully takes us on a journey through the world of the fixers keeping the gears of civilization rolling. If you’re the kind of person who wants to know why things break and how to stop it, you should read this book. Kyle Wiens CEO of iFixit What a splendid book to read while fixing an old house. I stopped moaning and whining and became a quiet hero of relentless “sustainment.” Bruce Sterling author and editor of Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology Maintenance is interesting in more ways than I can count. I felt smarter for having read this book and lucky for being alive at a time when Stewart Brand is writing it. Charles C. Mann author of 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus In his fresh and inimitable prose, Stewart Brand makes a striking case for what he calls maintenance–the upkeep of the things that make modern life possible. Back to the basics of caring and repairing–sailing boats, automobiles, sewing machines, Colt revolvers, bicycles and even tanks in the Yom Kippur war–Brand shows us why know-how and understanding how machines work really matter. New things get our attention but mastering how to take care of things we already have is life work that counts like no other. This book is Stewart Brand at his best. Jerry Brown former Governor of California A new classic — original and fresh, smart, wise, a universal topic, Stewart makes me so happy once again. Edward Tufte statistician and professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale University Efficiency is the engine of civilization. But where do improvements in production efficiency come from? In The Origins of Efficiency, Brian Potter argues that improving production efficiency—finding ways to produce goods and services in less time, with less labor, using fewer resources—is the force behind some of the most consequential changes in human history. He examines the fundamental characteristics of a production process and how each can be made faster, cheaper, and more reliable, with detailed examples from a range of industries: steel and semiconductors, wind turbines and container shipping, Tesla and the Ford Model T, and more. The Origins of Efficiency is a comprehensive companion for anyone seeking to understand how we arrived at this age of material abundance—and how we can push efficiency improvements into domains like housing, medicine, and education, where much work is left to be done. Brian Potter is the author of the Construction Physics newsletter and a senior infrastructure fellow at the Institute for Progress. He previously managed an engineering team at Katerra, a SoftBank-backed construction startup, and has 15 years of experience as a structural engineer. Brilliant and comprehensive. Brian Potter is the single best writer in America on how important things get built, and his new book is the single best example of his work. Derek Thompson author of Hit Makers and coauthor of Abundance A whole-systems overview of all known manufacturing processes (past and present), crammed with dense details, stories, anecdotes, and lessons from the front lines… If you have any interest in, or responsibility for, how to make stuff at scale, you need to read this book. Kevin Kelly founding executive editor of Wired Brian Potter does impeccable, detailed research that he turns into clairvoyant insight about civilization’s most arcane processes. Here, he examines the mechanisms that enable spectacular efficiency in the production of goods and services. Stewart Brand cofounder and president of The Long Now Foundation America has forgotten how to make things. Brian Potter is here to help us remember. By the time you finish this book, you’ll feel like you’re well on your way to becoming an expert in manufacturing. Noah Smith author of Noahpinion How did we build large language models? How do they think, if they think? What will the world look like if we have billions of AIs that are as smart as humans, or even smarter? In a series of in-depth interviews with leading AI researchers and company founders—including Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, DeepMind cofounder Demis Hassabis, OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever, MIRI cofounder Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—Dwarkesh Patel provides the first comprehensive and contemporary portrait of the technology that is transforming our world. Drawn from his interviews on the Dwarkesh Podcast, these curated excerpts range from the technical details of how LLMs work to the possibility of an AI takeover or explosive economic growth. It also includes 170+ definitions and visualizations, classic essays on the theme, and previously unpublished interviews. The Scaling Era offers readers unprecedented insight into a transformative moment in AI’s development—and a vision of what comes next. Dwarkesh Patel is the host of Dwarkesh Podcast, where he produces deeply researched interviews with both obscure intellectuals and the most influential figures of our time. Gavin Leech is the cofounder of Arb Research, a consultancy that does empirical and conceptual work in various sciences. He has a PhD in AI. Dwarkesh has done a whole series of excellent video interviews with top AI researchers and engineers, and this book is a great distillation of those conversations to help people understand modern AI models, how they are built, where they are headed, and why they are important. Jeff Dean chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research There’s only one test relevant for an artifact about AI: Would you learn more from reading it than you would from using a newly released LLM for the equivalent amount of time? The Scaling Era handily passes. Patrick McKenzie author of Bits About Money and host of Complex Systems Dwarkesh’s interviews are full of quotes that will be in history books. Byrne Hobart investor, consultant, and author of The Diff and Boom From the Moon landing to the dawning of the atomic age, the decades prior to the 1970s were characterized by the routine invention of transformative technologies at breakneck speed. By comparison, ours is an age of stagnation; of slowing median wage growth, rising inequality, and decelerated scientific discovery. In Boom, Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber take an inductive approach to this problem. They track some of the most significant breakthroughs of the past 100 years—from the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program to Moore’s law and Bitcoin—and reverse-engineer how transformative progress arises from the same dynamics that govern financial bubbles, bringing together small groups with a unified vision, vast funding, and surprisingly poor accountability. Bubbles, they conclude, aren’t all bad—in fact, they create the ideal conditions for transformative innovation. Integrating insights from economics, philosophy, and history, Boom provides a blueprint for accelerating innovation and a path to unleash a new era of global prosperity. Byrne Hobart is an investor, consultant, and writer. He is the author of The Diff, a daily newsletter covering inflection points in finance and technology. He is also a partner at Anomaly, a frontier tech investment firm. Tobias Huber is a writer and investor. He is a partner at Anomaly, a frontier tech investment firm. He has a background in philosophy and holds a doctor of science degree from ETH Zurich. The dot-com bubble looked like the peak of delusion, but the truly deluded were those who wanted to indefinitely defer the future. Everyone knows bubbles can disguise madness as wisdom; read this book for the alternative history of our age. Peter Thiel investor and author of Zero to One Boom makes the case that humanity’s greatest risk is not climate change or misaligned superintelligent Al but not making enough progress. A must-read for those who seek to build the future. Marc Andreessen cofounder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz When is it that temporary bubbles can help drive forward progress? This happened with the railroads, with the internet, and it is likely to happen with AI. Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber have produced some essential reading on a very important and also understudied topic. Tyler Cowen author of The Great Stagnation and professor of economics at George Mason University “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up,” Charlie Munger advises in Poor Charlie’s Almanack. Originally published in 2005, this compilation of 11 talks by the legendary Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman has become a touchstone for a generation of investors and entrepreneurs. Delivered with Munger’s characteristic rhetorical flair, Poor Charlie’s Almanack draws on his encyclopedic knowledge of business, finance, history, philosophy, physics, and ethics to introduce the latticework of mental models that underpin his rational and rigorous approach to life, learning, and decision-making. It is an essential volume for any reader seeking to go to bed a little wiser than when they woke up. This abridged edition features a new foreword by Stripe cofounder and president John Collison. Charles T. Munger (1924–2023) was an investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He was the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett. He was chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation from 1984 to 2011. He was also chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation and a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation.Peter D. Kaufman is the chairman and CEO of Glenair, Inc. He was a longtime director of Wesco Financial Corporation and is a former director of Daily Journal Corporation. In 2005, he edited and published Poor Charlie’s Almanack, a compilation of talks given by his longtime friend Charlie Munger. This book is something of a publishing miracle—never advertised, yet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its internet site. Warren Buffett CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Charlie Munger was born before corporate speak, before business leaders minced words to obscure truths. But Charlie Munger’s words have always cut like a knife—and that sharp spirit of truth-seeking built Berkshire into what it is today. We should all aspire to such clarity. Katherine Boyle general partner at a16z Poor Charlie’s Almanack is a timeless classic that will change how you approach life. There is a billion-dollar education inside this book. Shane Parrish founder of Syrus Partners and Farnam Street This book is the best way to learn from Munger and his ideas. It’s a must-read for anyone interested in thinking clearly, rationally, and effectively. Ana Lorena Fabrega author, educator, and chief evangelist at Synthesis Charlie Munger’s insights are timeless. Some of these speeches were delivered over 20 years ago, but they feel like they could have been given yesterday. Tyler Hogge venture partner at Pelion If I could only read one book to help me succeed in life and business, this is the book I’d read. Charlie’s timeless wisdom has inspired millions and will continue to resonate for generations to come. David Senra creator of the Founders podcast Scaling People is a practical and empathetic guide to company building and scaling the most important resource a company has: its people. Drawing on nearly two decades of experience as a Google and Stripe executive, Claire Hughes Johnson offers actionable insights and tactical guidance on everything from crafting foundational documents to hiring and team development to feedback and performance mechanisms. The book includes over 100 pages of worksheets, templates, exercises, and example documents to help founders, leaders, and company builders create scalable operating systems and lightweight processes that really work. With Scaling People, Hughes Johnson shares a detailed roadmap for building a sustainable, scalable company—one that’s set up for generational success. Claire Hughes Johnson is a corporate officer and adviser at Stripe. Previously, she was chief operating officer at Stripe from 2014 to 2021, helping the company grow from fewer than 200 employees to more than 7,000. Prior to Stripe, she spent 10 years at Google leading business teams, including overseeing aspects of Gmail, Google Apps, and consumer operations, as well as serving as a vice president for AdWords, Google Offers, and Google’s self-driving car project. She serves on the boards of Ameresco, The Atlantic, Aurora Innovation, and HubSpot. She lives outside of Boston with her husband, two children, and two neurotic dachshunds. Whether you are a new manager or a CEO, there are going to be moments when you feel alone and need help. Odds are, the advice you need is in Scaling People. You are going to pull this book off your shelf over and over! Kim Scott author of Radical Candor and Just Work There’s a lot of reinventing the wheel in a startup environment. Scaling People offers strong frameworks, sound advice, and tried-and-true processes that any company can use to build stronger foundations and sustainable success. Reid Hoffman cofounder of LinkedIn, partner at Greylock, host of Masters of Scale Scaling People is approachable, entertaining, and exceptionally useful, with lots of heart and humor. Claire leverages her years of experience to provide a deeply helpful resource to read and revisit again and again. Aileen Lee founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures Everything you need to know about building and scaling a company, being an exceptional leader and manager, and getting the best out of your people in one empathetic and enjoyable package—with easy-to-use worksheets and templates to boot. Frances Frei author of Uncommon Service and Unleashed, professor at Harvard Business School Claire Hughes Johnson is the ultimate operator. Scaling People proves that it’s possible to operate in a high-growth environment while simultaneously focusing on and caring about developing people—and that doing so also leads to a fundamentally stronger business. Mallun Yen founder of Operator Collective I was excited to learn that Claire Hughes Johnson has taken her many years of operating excellence from Stripe and Google and distilled it into a new book. Scaling People is a key book to be added to the shelf of any people leader and manager. Elad Gil entrepreneur, investor, and author of High Growth Handbook The world expects founders to succeed and thrive as their company grows. Yet no one takes the time to give them the skills and processes necessary to achieve great leadership. Now someone has—hats off to Claire Johnson for writing Scaling People. Bill Gurley general partner at Benchmark If you want to scale your business from 10 people to 10,000 without losing the things that make it special, Scaling People is the handbook you need. Ravi Gupta former CFO and COO of Instacart, general partner at Sequoia Capital Claire has demystified how you run a large, high-performance organization, with clear concepts and practical templates that you can start implementing today. Jason Citron founder and CEO of Discord In Pieces of the Action, Vannevar Bush—engineer, inventor, educator, and public face of government-funded science—offers an inside account of one of the most innovative research and development ecosystems of the 20th century. As the architect and administrator of an R&D pipeline that efficiently coordinated the work of civilian scientists and the military during World War II, he was central to catalyzing the development of radar and the proximity fuze, the mass production of penicillin, and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. Pieces of the Action offers his hard-won lessons on how to operate and manage effectively within complex organizations, build bridges between people and disciplines, and drive ambitious, unprecedented programs to fruition. Originally published in 1970, this updated edition includes a foreword from Ben Reinhardt that contextualizes the lessons Pieces of the Action can offer to contemporary readers: that change depends both on heroic individuals and effective organizations; that a leader’s job is one of coordination; and that the path from idea to innovation is a long and winding one, inextricably bound to those involved—those enduring figures who have a piece of the action. Vannevar Bush (1890–1974) was an engineer, inventor, educator, and architect of public-sector funding for scientific research in the United States. During World War II, he oversaw a wide-ranging R&D program that paired government funding with scientific research, resulting in the development of radar and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. Outside of government, he conducted foundational research in computer science, including the invention of the differential analyzer. His 1945 essay “As We May Think” is credited with anticipating aspects of personal computing and the internet, while his government report Science, The Endless Frontier laid the groundwork for the founding of the National Science Foundation. Both are considered seminal texts that have inspired successive generations of scientists and engineers. Pieces of the Action is not just about science and innovation, it’s about state capacity. Anyone who longs for renewed, effective institutions will find the wisdom of a kindred spirit reflecting on how to build them. Eli Dourado economist and senior research fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University Pieces of the Action provides a window into the way Bush saw himself: as part of a larger cultural tradition, equipping new generations with knowledge from past ones. I came away encouraged and inspired by the knowledge that great things can be built in spite of stagnation, rigid norms, and conventions, through the determination and foresight of people who work to change institutions—and build new ones, too. Saloni Dattani cofounder and editor of Works in Progress and researcher at Our World in Data Scientific and technological progress depend crucially on leadership. Bush understood this better than anyone, and he had a front-row seat to the most important R&D work of the 20th century. This candid memoir gave me a better understanding of how research leadership works and why it’s desperately needed. Jason Crawford writer at The Roots of Progress It’s hard to deny that Vannevar Bush was at the nexus of an astounding number of people and events that shaped the modern world. In Pieces of the Action, he works hard to give us a window into his thought processes, and from them distill timeless lessons about leadership, research, institution building, and human nature. Ben Reinhardt CEO of PARPA, researcher at the Astera Institute, and host of the Idea Machines podcast Pieces of the Action catalogs the scientists and engineers who were pivotal to an Allied victory in World War II—and how the ad-hoc organizations born out of that crisis ultimately provided the blueprints for our modern scientific institutions. If you want to understand the ‘man in the arena’ at the center of it all, this discursive, blunt, and often funny memoir is the best place to start. Alec Stapp cofounder and co-CEO of the Institute for Progress Pieces of the Action is an often-whimsical ride through time and the mind of the man whose insight, strategic instincts, and institutional empire-building formed the basis of the modern scientific state. One comes away with a view of scientific development that is anything but linear: the gravitational weight of historical contingencies, idiosyncratic personnel, and key management decisions described in Pieces of the Action continue to profoundly impact us today. Caleb Watney cofounder and co-CEO of the Institute for Progress In Where Is My Flying Car?, engineer and futurist J. Storrs Hall sets out to answer the deceptively simple question posed in the book’s title. What starts as an exploration of the technical limitations of building flying cars evolves into an examination of the global economic stagnation that started in the 1970s. From the failure to adopt nuclear energy and the suppression of cold fusion and nanotechnology to the rise of a counterculture hostile to progress, Hall recounts how our collective ambitions for the future were derailed, with devastating consequences for global wealth creation and distribution. Hall then outlines a framework for a future powered by exponential progress—one in which we build as much in the world of atoms as we do in the world of bits, one rich in abundance and wonder. J. Storrs Hall, Ph.D., is an independent scientist and author. He was the founding chief scientist of Nanorex, Inc. and a president of the Foresight Institute and is currently a research fellow at the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing and an associate editor of the International Journal of Nanotechnology and Molecular Computation. He was also accredited as an expert reviewer for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the field of computational climate models. His previous books include Beyond AI: Creating the Conscience of the Machine and Nanofuture: What’s Next for Nanotechnology. Now residing on Chesapeake Bay, he dabbles in aerodynamics design under the auspices of Eastern Shore Flying Cars, LLC. There are many writers with optimistic visions of the future. However, the goals I most often hear are all the negation of negatives: cure cancer, eliminate poverty, stop climate change. . . . This is good, but it is not enough. [These techno-optimists] are content with bringing the whole world up to the current best standard of living, but not increasing it. In this context, I found Where Is My Flying Car? refreshing. Hall unabashedly calls for unlimited progress in every dimension. Jason Crawford founder and CEO of Roots of Progress One of the best and most interesting books on technology. Tyler Cowen professor of economics at George Mason University and cowriter of Marginal Revolution Whether there is ‘tech stagnation’ or a revolution about to swarm the skies, Where Is My Flying Car? offers piercing questions and answers about what it might take to make the dream come true. David Brin author of Existence and The Postman While Silicon Valley is synonymous with software, its beginnings were driven by a need for a better class of hardware. Michael S. Malone’s The Big Score is a panoramic history of Silicon Valley’s founding days—written as they were still playing out in 1985. One of the first reporters on the tech industry beat, Malone recounts the feverish efforts of technologists and entrepreneurs to build something that would change the world. Starting with the birth of the semiconductor in the 1930s, he illustrates how decades of technological innovation laid the foundation for the meteoric rise of the Valley in the 1970s. Malone punctuates this history with profiles of tech’s early builders, capturing the high-agency spirit that shaped the electronics revolution. A decades-long story with individual sacrifice and ingenuity at its core, The Big Score recounts the history of today’s most dynamic sector through its upstart beginnings. Michael S. Malone has covered Silicon Valley and tech for over 30 years. His articles and editorials have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Economist, Fortune, New York Times, and San Jose Mercury-News. He has written or co-authored more than 25 award-winning books, including Bill and Dave and The Intel Trinity, and coproduced The New Heroes, an Emmy-nominated miniseries on social entrepreneurs. He lives in Palo Alto, California. Mike Malone’s epic depiction of Silicon Valley was a calling card for me and countless other young entrepreneurs with a background in tech. Malone’s stories captured the essence of Valley culture and the many outsize personalities who helped create this mecca of tech. Years later, this book is still relevant, and offers insights into the Valley and its ongoing place in the world. Jeff Skoll first president of eBay Mike Malone is the gold standard for telling Silicon Valley’s history. He has witnessed the evolution of the Valley from fruit groves to office parks, and has catalogued the world’s dependency on the Valley’s innovative technology. Experience the growth of Silicon Valley through the eyes of a pioneer, friend, reporter, and mentor to so many of us early Valley entrepreneurs. Sandy Kurtzig founder, CEO, and chairman of ASK Group From the Valley’s deep roots in the semiconductor industry to the rise of startups and venture capital, and the emergence of new models of management, The Big Score documents the beginnings of a technological transformation. When the book was first published, the microprocessor was kick-starting the computer industry. Today, our greatest innovators continue to build on the work of these early pioneers. John Hennessy president emeritus of Stanford University and chairman, Alphabet Inc. So rich was the scientific harvest of the early 20th century that it transformed entire industries and economies. Max Planck laid the foundation for quantum physics, Barbara McClintock for modern genetics, Linus Pauling for chemistry—the list goes on. But in the 1970s, the nature and pace of scientific discovery began to stagnate due to a combination of peer review, mandated justification of spending, and the push for short-term miracles. In Scientific Freedom, first published in 2008, Donald W. Braben presents a framework to find and support transformative scientific innovation. Even in the earliest stages, groundbreaking research can look unrecognizable to those who are accustomed to the patterns established by the past. As Braben argues, support for this research requires rethinking the processes used to discover and sponsor scientists with revolutionary ideas—and then giving them the freedom to explore. Donald W. Braben is a scientist and author. From 1980 to 1990, he led British Petroleum’s Venture Research program, for which he developed a radical, low-cost approach to finding and funding researchers whose work might redefine their fields. He currently holds an honorary position at University College London. A superb book, both inspiring and provocative. Braben strives to ensure that the most creative scientists, if completely free to pursue unorthodox research, will aim to attain the ‘elixir of civilization.’ Dudley Herschbach Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1986 All scientists, granting agencies, and policymakers should read this refreshing book and respond to the need to change current funding paradigms. Sir Richard J. Roberts Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1993 Braben has long held visionary views of how to fund the most innovative and creative science. It cannot be denied that, with the right financial support, his approach can be made to work spectacularly. Sir Martyn Poliakoff University of Nottingham, Michael Faraday Prize 2019 A sobering (but hopeful!) exploration of the stagnation in what I would call ‘paradigm shifting research’ and what to do about it. Ben Reinhardt Braben does an excellent job of highlighting the need to reassess the selection criteria used to decide what scientific projects receive funding. Quarterly Review of Biology Over the last 20 years, open source software has undergone a significant shift—from providing an optimistic model for public collaboration to undergoing constant maintenance by the often unseen solo operators who write and publish the code that millions of users rely on every day. In Working in Public, Nadia Eghbal takes an inside look at modern open source software development, its evolution over the last two decades, and its ramifications for an internet reorienting itself around individual creators. By delineating the structure of open source projects, she explores, for the first time, the maintenance costs of production that software incurs for its developers. Drawing on hundreds of developer interviews and analyses of platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, and YouTube, Eghbal argues that examining who produces things on the internet, and not just what they produce, helps us understand the value of online content today. Nadia Eghbal is a writer and researcher who explores how the internet enables individual creators. From 2015 to 2019, she worked independently and at GitHub to improve the open source developer experience. She is the author of “Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure,” published by the Ford Foundation. Nadia writes from a unique perspective at the intersection of open source, economics, and poetry. This is the definitive book on the dynamics of online creative communities. Nat Friedman CEO of GitHub Nadia is one of today’s most nuanced thinkers about the depth and potential of online communities. This book could not have come at a better time, as the ways we relate to each other have become more sharply mediated by the internet. Devon Zuegel former director of product for communities at GitHub In the age of information abundance, we’re all maintainers now. Working in Public is an anthropological dive into the stories of real developers, providing us a way to ask new questions through the lens of open source. Nadia presents us with a book that isn’t focused on just money, licenses, or code, but which is for all of us who make, as creators of all kinds. Henry Zhu maintainer of Babel Working in Public [is] a fascinating book . . . . We need to rethink the very idea of what crowdsourcing is capable of—and understand that it is perhaps more limited than promised. The open source revolution has been carried on the backs of some very weary people. Wired Eghbal clearly sees and articulates something important about the way we make things, and how that’s changing. . . .Working in Public opens by challenging a common perception about open source today: the idea that it’s collaborative. Alex Danco What inspires a great idea? Can we train our thinking to develop world-changing understandings and insights? Richard Hamming would say yes. In The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, he elaborates on his seminal essay “You and Your Research,” a provocative challenge to anyone who wants to build something great, and offers a manual of style for how to get there. Playfully framed as a textbook, and rich in its recounting of influential individuals like Albert Einstein and Grace Hopper, this unorthodox memoir by the seminal mathematician and engineer encourages the reader to aspire to, learn from, and surpass the achievements of yesterday’s greatest minds. This edition includes the original 1996 compilation of Hamming’s lectures for the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, along with a new foreword by designer and engineer Bret Victor and more than 70 redrawn graphs and charts. Richard W. Hamming (1915–1998) was a scientist and mathematician who discovered formulas that allow computers to correct their own errors. He provided crucial programming support to the Manhattan Project, and later joined Bell Labs. In 1968, he received the Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science. Hamming is here to tell you about excellence. His lessons unfold through personal stories of discovery and failure—life as an extraordinary scientist. But Hamming demands that you do extraordinary work, too, and for that he offers the best advice I know. Andy Matuschak software engineer, designer, and researcher Hamming was always as much a teacher as a scientist, and, having spent a lifetime forming and confirming a theory of great people, he felt he could prepare the next generation for even greater greatness. That’s the premise and promise of this book. Bret Victor founder of Dynamicland Your last chance to read the thinking of one of the major intellects that the U.S.A. has produced. Eugene N. Miya NASA researcher [Hamming] was one of the last geniuses who believed in innovation as a shared public project. New Yorker, which named The Art of Doing Science and Engineering a best book of 2020 Before Prince of Persia was a bestselling video game franchise and a Disney movie, it was an Apple II computer game created and programmed by a lone developer, Jordan Mechner. Mechner’s candid and revealing journals from the time capture the journey from his parents’ basement to the forefront of the fast-growing 1980s video game industry, as a 20-year-old fresh out of college with a liberal arts degree—and the creative, technical, personal, and professional struggles that brought the Prince into the homes of millions of people worldwide. In The Making of Prince of Persia, on the 30th anniversary of the game’s release, Mechner looks back at the journals he kept from 1985 to 1993 and annotates them with insights into the game that established him as a pioneer of cinematic storytelling in the industry. Jordan Mechner is a game designer, screenwriter, and author. His other books include the sketchbook journal Year 2 in France and the Eisner Award-nominated graphic novel Templar, a New York Times bestseller illustrated by LeUyen Pham and Alex Puvilland. Prince of Persia was the first computer game I ever fell in love with. Mechner’s journey is a universal one for anyone creating something brand-new, and it brought me back to the early, crazy days of building Instagram. Mike Krieger cofounder of Instagram Mechner’s journals are a unique record from the birth of an industry. The Making of Prince of Persia is also an unvarnished window into the creative process, with all its excitement, toil, setbacks, doubts, and triumphs. A fantastic read. D.B. Weiss cocreator of HBO’s Game of Thrones Probably my favorite book on game development. Neil Druckmann writer and director of The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 It’s a genuinely delightful book, even if you don’t care about the history of video games. . . .To read Mechner’s contemporaneous logs of his wrestling with his tools and machines is to take a journey back to a heroic age of games authorship. Cory Doctorow The best biography I’ve ever read. Applied Divinity Studies Although communities feel magical, they don’t come together by magic.

Robert Wang founder of Instant Pot While management is foundational to any organization, engineering management in particular presents its own set of challenges—especially in high-growth environments. How and when should your engineers pay down technical debt? How do you tackle a seemingly endless stream of migrations? How do you ensure that each engineer on your team is growing at the right pace? Will Larson’s An Elegant Puzzle explores the specific challenges of engineering management—from sizing teams to handling technical debt to developing succession planning—and provides a guide to solving complex managerial problems. Drawing on his experience at Digg, Uber, and Stripe, Larson presents a thoughtful approach to engineering management that balances structured principles with human-centric thinking. A useful primer for engineering leaders of all levels at companies of all sizes, An Elegant Puzzle lays out a road map for building organizations where engineers can thrive. Will Larson has been an engineering leader at technology companies including Yahoo, Digg, Uber, Stripe, and Calm. An Elegant Puzzle draws from writing on his blog, Irrational Exuberance.

The insights and step-by-step approach covered in An Elegant Puzzle will become your favorite go-to resource. Oren Ellenbogen VP of engineering at Forter An Elegant Puzzle is to date the most hands-on perspective on engineering management within a high-growth, tech-first organization, that I have read. . . .[It] is not just for engineering managers: product managers and engineers working at high-growth companies will find it a good read. Gergely Orosz Larson captures the timeless spirit of creative problem-solving that draws us to software engineering while also providing concrete strategies for modern organizations. Software Engineering Daily When it comes to the flow of information, technology has categorically reversed the balance of power between the public and the elites who manage the great hierarchical institutions of the industrial age—government, political parties, and the media. In The Revolt of the Public, Martin Gurri tells the story of how insurgencies, enabled by digital devices and a vast information sphere, have mobilized millions of ordinary people around the world. Originally published in 2014, The Revolt of the Public now appears in an updated edition, which includes an extensive analysis of Donald Trump’s improbable rise to the presidency and the electoral triumphs of Brexit. Gurri concludes with a look forward, considering whether the current elite class can bring about a reformation of the democratic process, and whether new organizing principles, adapted to a digital world, can arise out of the present political turbulence. Martin Gurri is a geopolitical analyst who specializes in the relationship between politics and global media. He spent 28 years analyzing open media at the CIA. The Revolt of the Public draws from writing on his blog, The Fifth Wave. All over the world, elite institutions, from governments to media to academia, are losing their authority and monopoly control of information to the broader public. This book has been my No. 1 handout to anyone seeking to understand this unfolding shift in power from hierarchies to networks in the age of the internet. Marc Andreessen cofounder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz Martin Gurri saw it coming. When, without fanfare, he self-published the first edition in June of 2014, he did not specifically name Donald Trump or Brexit. But he saw how the internet in general and social media in particular were transforming the political landscape. Arnold Kling economist and writer We are in an open war between publics with passionate and untutored interests and elites who believe they have the right to guide those publics. Gurri asks the essential question: Can liberal representative democracy survive the rise of the publics? Roger Berkowitz founder of the Hannah Arendt Center and professor of politics and human rights at Bard College “The internet has been a marvelous invention in lots of ways, but it has also unleashed a tsunami of misinformation and destabilized political systems across the globe. Martin Gurri . . . was way ahead of the curve on this problem. Vox Mr. Gurri writes that the internet has empowered ordinary citizens by giving them new information and tools, which they then use to discover the flaws in the systems and institutions that govern their lives. New York Times Throughout history, economic growth has alleviated human misery, improved human happiness and opportunity, expanded political rights, and lengthened human lives. If we want to prolong growth trends and the overwhelmingly positive outcomes for societies that come with them, every individual must become more concerned with the welfare of those around us. So how do we enable such altruism? In Stubborn Attachments—a culmination of 20 years of philosophical and economic thinking and research—Tyler Cowen argues that reason and common sense can help free us of the faulty ideas that hold us back as people and as a society, allowing us to set our sights on the long-term struggles that maximize sustainable economic growth while respecting human rights. At its heart, Stubborn Attachments makes the contemporary moral case for economic growth and delivers a dose of inspiration and optimism about the future. Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and director of the Mercatus Center. He was named in an Economist poll as one of the most influential economists of the past decade. He is the author of several books, including the New York Times bestseller The Great Stagnation, and is an opinion columnist at Bloomberg. He also cowrites the blog Marginal Revolution and hosts the podcast Conversations with Tyler. Most of Tyler’s books will change how you see the world in a myriad of small ways. Stubborn Attachments might well change the way you see the world in one very big way. Whether you agree or disagree with Tyler’s argument, I think you’ll find that following the logic in Stubborn Attachments is as fun as it is intellectually provocative. Cardiff Garcia cohost of the NPR podcast The Indicator from Planet Money Tyler Cowen is a national treasure, and Stubborn Attachments is brimming with deep insights–about the immense importance of economic growth, moral obligations, rights, and how to think about the future. It’s a book for right now, and a book for all times. A magnificent achievement. Cass R. Sunstein Robert Walmsley University Professor at Harvard and bestselling author of Nudge Tyler Cowen is one of the most intriguing and eclectic thinkers on the planet—like many people, I read something by him every day. In Stubborn Attachments, he combines economics and philosophy in a truly important achievement. His best, most ambitious, and most personal work. Tim Harford author of The Undercover Economist The thing about economic growth, Cowen tells us, is that it has the potential to advance just about everything that people value. . . .There is considerable evidence supporting the commonsense view that citizens of rich countries are happier than citizens of poor countries, and that, within rich countries, wealthier individuals are happier than poorer ones. New Yorker Stubborn Attachments is a philosophy book. . . .[Tyler] doesn’t try to set out an absolute, formalistic, fully internally consistent system of ethical principles—instead, he embraces an eclectic, often conflicting set of principles. This is refreshing, since rigid systems always prove fragile to intuitive counterexamples. Noah Smith Stubborn Attachments presents a compelling case for redefining our long-term priorities in favor of more sustained economic growth and a greater respect for human rights. Los Angeles Review of Books Behind every great revolution is a vision, and behind one of the greatest revolutions of our time—personal computing—is the vision of J. C. R. Licklider. He wasn’t an engineer and he didn’t start a company or write code; instead, he was a relentless visionary who saw great potential in the way individuals could interact with computers and software. At a time when computers were a short step removed from mechanical data processors, Licklider was an enthusiastic catalyst for the seminal research that ultimately led to the internet. In a simultaneously compelling personal narrative and comprehensive historical exposition, The Dream Machine by M. Mitchell Waldrop tells the story of the birth of the computing revolution through the life of a man who shifted our understanding of what computers were and could be. Originally published in 2001, the book now appears in a new edition, which includes the original texts of Licklider’s three most influential writings. M. Mitchell Waldrop earned a PhD in elementary particle physics and a master’s in journalism at the University of Wisconsin. He has been a writer and editor at Science and Nature. He is the author of Man-Made Minds (1987), a book about artificial intelligence, and Complexity (1992), about the new sciences of complexity. When people ask me about Xerox PARC, I always tell them about J. C. R. Licklider—‘Lick’—and how he started the great research funding for interactive computing and pervasive worldwide networks, which have resulted in most of the technology we use today. The top book I recommend to read about this large process, which stretched over 20 years, is The Dream Machine by Mitchell Waldrop. Alan Kay computer scientist A masterpiece! A mesmerizing but balanced and comprehensive look at the making of the information revolution—the people, the ideas, the tensions, and the hurdles. John Seely Brown former director of Xerox PARC A sprawling history of the ideas, individuals, and groups of people that got us from punch cards to personal computers . . . impressive . . . compelling. New York Times The Dream Machine works admirably as an exploration of the intellectual and political roots of the rise of modern computing. It’s an ambitious and worthwhile addition to the history of science. San Francisco Chronicle Global technology executive, serial entrepreneur, and angel investor Elad Gil has worked with high-growth tech companies like Airbnb, Twitter, Google, Stripe, and Square as they’ve scaled from small companies to global enterprises.

Max Levchin cofounder and CEO of Affirm, cofounder and former CTO of PayPal Many founders eventually face a moment in their company’s journey when they’ll need to scale the company and think much longer-term about success. Mr. Gil’s book walks founders through some of the steps and challenges they’ll face, such as the role of a board, mergers and acquisitions and more. Wall Street Journal “We are as gods and might as well get good at it,” wrote Stewart Brand in 1968, as the opening sentence to the now iconic Whole Earth Catalog. For decades, Brand has had an uncanny ability to push “ideas that seem at the edge of believability,” accelerating progress in culture, technology, environmentalism, and more. His approach to work and life influenced many technologists who have gone on to shape our modern world, including Steve Jobs. We Are As Gods, produced by Stripe Press, is the first feature film about Brand’s remarkable life. Marrying never-before-seen footage with contemporary interviews, the film chronicles his journey, from his early days with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters through the birth of the personal computing revolution, to his latest quest to reorient environmentalism. The original score was composed by experimental musician and artist Brian Eno, who’s collaborated with artists such as David Bowie, the Talking Heads, and U2. Along with Brand, Eno is a founding board member of the Long Now Foundation, whose mission is to foster long-term thinking and responsibility. He contributed 24 original tracks, in addition to some classics. Infrastructure is—finally—having its moment. From transit systems to supply chains, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and others are evaluating whether our civic infrastructure is up to the task of supporting a growing—and warming—globe. In each episode of Beneath the Surface, we explore some of the most complicated challenges facing our world, and talk to the people who are rolling up their sleeves to build solutions. The New Atlantis: Charter cities Each year, tens of millions of people migrate from rural areas to cities—mostly in emerging economies, where populations are growing faster than governments can create basic infrastructure. To address the challenges of urbanization without industrialization, development experts, economists, and policymakers have proposed solutions spanning from increased immigration to better family planning. In this episode, we ask: could charter cities—a model inspired by the successes of places like Singapore and Shenzhen—be a path to accelerating growth in emerging economies? Founder and managing partner, Pronomos Capital Founder and former executive director of the Charter Cities Institute Founder and co-managing partner of Thebe Investment Management PhD candidate at McGill University Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto, and author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Juan Du, Dean of the University of Toronto School of Architecture, discuss Du’s book, The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City—and the many myths that surround the city’s origin and development. Salton Sea: White Gold in the California Desert In 1905, an engineering accident created one of the largest lakes in the United States: the Salton Sea. Now, more than 100 years later, the lake is shrinking, and has become one of the most polluted bodies of water in the US. But the area is also poised to become the largest lithium mine in the country—to be used by GM, Tesla, and Ford to manufacture their electric vehicles. Still, there’s an inherent tension between mining heavy metals—often a dirty, high-pollution process, for environmentally beneficial purposes. In this episode, we explore the future of energy production, how boom and bust cycles affect cities and communities, and the often overlooked environmental considerations that roil the development of green infrastructure. Author of Queen of the Salton Sea: Helen Burns and Me Journalist at VICE Research Professor at University of California, Riverside Founder of Saving the Salton Sea and director of the Salton Sea Film Festival Audrey Carleton, environmental journalist for VICE, discusses the potential for lithium extraction at the Salton Sea to catalyze the burgeoning electric vehicle industry, the parallels to the oil and gas industries, and what it all means for the area's residents. The Industrial Ballet: An Investigation into Global Supply Chains Thanks to the global supply chain crisis, millions of consumer goods, from computer chips to couches to cell phones are in high demand but short supply. It would be tempting to think that the pandemic is the main culprit for the backup of global trade flows—but COVID merely exposed existing fault lines in our infrastructure. The advent of just-in-time manufacturing and a relentless focus on short-term earnings have left companies with little inventory in case of emergencies, making our supply chains less resilient. Ryan Petersen—CEO of Flexport, which manages global trade and logistics for some of the largest companies in the world—has some thoughts about how we can fix that. You Say You Want to Build More Housing The price of housing in major cities has, over the past few decades, far outpaced the cost of construction. Average New York City metropolitan area house prices are up 706% since 1980 (or 376% more than US consumer prices, and 326% more than US wages). For San Francisco the rise is 932%. In Ireland, prices have risen by about 800% in that period, driven by increases in Dublin in particular. The immediate effects of the housing crunch are generally well-understood: productivity suffers when people aren’t able to live near the jobs they want. But there are other, less-explored effects of the crunch: an increase in obesity (as folks become more sedentary due to longer commutes and a lack of walkable suburbs), a decrease in birth rates (as housing is often the biggest expense for families, making it difficult to realize their ideal family size), climate change, and inequity. Still, there are reasons to be optimistic. Advocates of building more housing are gaining important victories all around the world—but it remains to be seen whether or not these victories will prove to be lasting. Head of the Urbanity Project at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University Founder of YIMBY Action Associate Professor of Economics at Trinity College Dublin Community leaders in the North London Haredi community In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Ronan Lyons, Associate Professor in Economics at Trinity College Dublin, discuss Ireland’s economic development, the current challenges facing would-be homeowners and renters in Dublin, and the time the biggest concern in the Irish housing market was too much supply. Growing Pains and Bullet Trains: The Art and Science of Moving People In 2016, the much-anticipated Second Avenue Subway line opened in Manhattan, New York. It took nearly a century to finish, and it was the most expensive per-mile subway project… ever—a rare new addition to one of the largest and the oldest subway systems in the world. By contrast, half a world away, Tokyo has a sprawling web of commuter trains—boasting the 50 busiest train stations in the world. Yet today, even the busiest lines in Tokyo only experience a yearly average delay of 20 seconds—and minimal incidents. How did Tokyo manage to avoid the friction common in the transit systems of other megacities? In this episode, we examine how officials in post WWII-Japan created one of the most efficient examples of scaled infrastructure in the modern world—and what cities around the world can learn from them. Author of Pedestrian Observations and the Transit Costs project Associate Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University Pioneer Valley Planning Commission, Springfield, Massachusetts Train journalist and writer of How to Enjoy Railroads From Train Schedules. In this conversation, host Tamara Winter and Alex Forrest, transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts, discuss the history of transit in the US, the relationship between transit and housing prices, and the formative years Forrest spent in Japan—and how they’ve shaped his current work in Springfield. People and Ideas: Populations as Infrastructure Up to now, we’ve explored physical infrastructure: supply chains, housing, transportation, and more. But the ultimate resource for any country is its people. For most of human history, populations were fairly stable. Then, in the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution precipitated an exponential increase in population, which reached a peak in the mid-20th century. Today, however, the demographic outlook in many developed countries is the opposite: birth rates around the world have fallen below the replacement rate. In this episode, we explore the effects of declining birth rates and what, if anything, could be done to reverse them. Along the way, we’ll dig into one of the thorniest questions about population growth: what happens when governments try to influence it through policy? Assistant Professor of Quantitative Analysis, Samford University Economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and Fellow at NYU Law Author of Slow Boring and One Billion Americans Retired Teacher, English Language Institute of Singapore Retired Quantity Surveyor In this conversation, Shruti Rajagopalan, Head of India Policy Research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and host Tamara Winter discuss Shruti's research on how population growth can accelerate economic development, the unintended consequences of fertility policy, and why 1991 was a pivotal year for India.

Wooo! Finally we got lights. Tamara Winter: Lagos, Nigeria is one of the largest cities in the world. It’s home to over 14 million people and one of Africa’s main economic hubs. It’s the most populous city in the country with Africa’s largest GDP. However in Lagos, even basic services are unreliable. Archived audio: Everything comes to life when there’s light. When there’s no light you can literally feel handicapped. Tamara Winter: This isn’t a new problem in Lagos. An unstable power grid and political corruption make providing everyday utilities—like electricity—a struggle. In 2016, The Guardian reported on a neighborhood that went without power for five years because its residents refused to pay bribes. These kinds of challenges are not unique to Lagos or even to Nigeria. Across the developing world—from Jakarta to Kinshasa—cities are growing rapidly. New residents are pouring into cities that have neither the infrastructure nor the institutions to adequately serve them. In his 2005 book Planet of Slums urban theorist Mike Davis chronicled the rise of million-person cities in the developing world. He described the lives of the more than one billion people who live in the world’s slums. Booming populations of these fast-growing cities find themselves in harsh living conditions. Flooded streets. Poor ventilation. Little to no waste clearance. And few basic services. The absence of infrastructure makes life dangerous. Lack of access to sanitation and healthcare are directly responsible for high infant and maternal mortality. Communicable diseases—that have become a thing of the past elsewhere—run rampant. Despite these challenges, people across the developing world are seeking out the economic opportunities that cities provide. So, is there another way? Another avenue for people in search of a better life to access not only economic opportunities, but also stable governance and reliable institutions. In this episode, we’ll be looking at one possible solution: charter cities. Built—sometimes almost from scratch—in developing countries. These developments are outside-the-box infrastructure. Rather than reforming or building on existing cities they are new constructions often with their own economic regulations and laws. Privately backed. And focused on bringing economic growth to emerging economies. Supporters see them as a way to theoretically seed the ground for more stable institutions and improved governance. Hello and welcome to the first episode of Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press exploring new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. It’s not an accident that the first episode begins in Nigeria. That’s where I was born. My family moved to the United States when I was just two months old. But growing up in Texas I often wondered: what if instead of being raised in Dallas, I grew up in Lagos, like the majority of my family? That question is part of why I’ve always been so fascinated by questions about development and specifically, about Africa’s trajectory. It’s part of my story. I’m also no stranger to the world of new cities. I used to work at the Charter Cities Institute. We’ll actually hear from the institute’s founder Mark Lutter a little later in this episode. The Institute, based in Washington D.C. is a non-profit that’s working to build the ecosystem for charter cities by developing institutional frameworks that can guide their creation. Now, before we get into the nitty gritty, I want to be really clear about some of the words we’re using in this episode. You’ve already heard me say ‘new cities’ and ‘charter cities.’ There’s a pretty broad ecosystem of new city projects. So when we’re talking about the whole landscape, I’ll use the term ‘new cities’—charter cities are just one part of that world, the part most focused on leveraging the creation of new cities for global development. So, what are charter cities and where did the idea for them come from in the first place? If you spend any amount of time talking to folks about new cities there’s one name that will keep popping up. Person 1: Paul Romer Person 2: Paul Romer Person 3: Professor Paul Romer Tamara Winter: Paul. Romer. He’s not a household name, but he’s been one of the most influential economists in the world for the last 20 years. He’s a former Chief Economist at the World Bank and in 2018 he even won the Nobel Prize. Archived audio: Dear Professor Romer...the tools you have developed broaden the scope of economic analysis...I now ask you to receive your prizes from his Majesty the King. Tamara Winter: He’s a big deal—if you’re an economist. But that’s not why all these people mention his name. In 2009, he gave a TED Talk. Now this might not seem that exciting—an economist giving a 20 minute lecture about his new idea. In fact, if you watch the talk—it’s on YouTube—you might not walk away inspired to start a city of your own. Romer walks on stage his hair more salt than pepper and close-cropped, wearing blue jeans and a dark suit jacket over a button down shirt. He paces back and forth while he talks, a clicker in his right hand occasionally changing slides behind him. His voice is steady, not monotonous, but not an orator’s. The talk has been posted on YouTube for just over 12 years and has only a little more than 150,000 views. However, for many who saw this talk back in 2009, who were captivated by Romer’s ideas, it was an a-ha moment. Like when the Beatles first went on the Ed Sullivan show. Back in 1964 a generation of young music lovers saw four guys from Liverpool playing music on their TV and thought to themselves: maybe my friends and I can do that. Inspired by Romer’s talk, many entrepreneurs began wondering the same kind of thing—what if they could build charter cities too. So—Romer’s idea. Charter cities. New cosmopolitan growth centers that would promote economic development and connect developing countries to the rest of the global economy. Romer’s proposed cities would be more than special economic zones—areas with different economic regulations—they would also be special governance zones. Places where different laws would allow for faster economic growth thanks to better institutions. Romer imagined cities located in developing countries administered by the governments of developed countries. Now, more than 12 years after Romer’s talk, if you ask some of the people most involved with the movement what charter cities are, and what purposes they serve, you’ll get pretty different answers. Patri Friedman: I think of a charter city as a special jurisdiction that is a geographic area that has different laws and institutions from the rest of the country. And the amount of difference has to be more than a special economic zone which typically just has some tax breaks, tariff breaks, a small number of legal changes. Tamara Winter: That was Patri Friedman. He runs Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm which invests in new city projects. Their slogan: Better laws. Better lives. Oh, and if you caught that his last name is Friedman. Yeah, he’s the grandson of legendary economist Milton Friedman. He got his start in the world of new cities when he founded the Seasteading Institute. A non-profit that worked to establish autonomous communities on free-floating platforms stationed in international waters. Friedman’s interest in new cities came from his analysis of governance as a kind of product that should be subject to updates. Patri Friedman: Why do our cellphones get better every year and our governments maybe occasionally get better, maybe sometimes degrade and what I realized is that if you throw away all the morality and philosophy and say, “Okay this is an industry”, what characteristics does it have? Tamara Winter: Mark Lutter, the founder and executive director of the Charter Cities Institute has a slightly more technical definition of what constitutes a charter city. Mark Lutter: So a charter city is a new city development: a new city with better laws. Paul Romer, for example, was advocating that high-income countries such as Canada act as a guarantor in a low-income country such as Honduras. And the Charter Cities Institute moved away from this, I guess, this idea, this definition, arguing for a public-private partnership. Tamara Winter: Lutter founded the Charter Cities Institute just one year after finishing his PhD in economics. In his view, charter city developments, if and when successful, will have long term positive impacts beyond the cities themselves. Mark Lutter: Charter cities have primarily been focused on emerging markets, creating a space with new institutions. So this would be going to places like Nigeria, Zambia, Honduras and creating new city developments that allowed for people to be able to hire more easily to, resolve disputes more easily to pay taxes, to register a business, having a government that’s effective at providing public goods, and this would allow for sustained economic development over time. Tamara Winter: The Institute’s website lists some of the existing cities that they see as examples of this model—jurisdictions that improved their governance and, as a result, their economic output. Dubai. Singapore. Shenzhen. Hong Kong. These cities have all experienced astronomical growth in relatively short periods of time. The Charter Cities Institute’s website has a slideshow with before and after images of each city and information about their growth. The images that accompany these numbers are just as striking. Shenzhen in 1980 is a pastoral scene of green fields, rolling hills, and distant mountains—home to about 300,000 people. But by 2017, it is all sleek skyscrapers and glowing lights—a metropolis with a population to rival New York City. Oh, and the average yearly income increased over 10,000 percent, too. Browsing these figures. Listening to Friedman and Lutter. And hearing Romer’s optimism echoing from 2009, it’s easy to understand why so many people are so dedicated to promoting the idea of new cities. But what do these numbers really mean? Who are these cities being built by? And maybe more importantly, who are they being built for? I first met Mwiya Musokotwane on a trip to a remote island in Zambia. I was there as part of my work for the Charter Cities Institute. Mwiya’s a stoic, physically imposing guy, well over six feet tall. I’ve known him for a while now and he’s basically got two speeds: full suit and sweatsuit. He’s either in board rooms, meeting with elected officials, and giving presentations, or he’s at home being a doting dad, the kind who keeps a lot of pictures of his daughter in his pocket—and on his Instagram. He’s the co-managing partner, along with his father, of Thebe Investment Management and the founder of Nkwashi, a new charter city project in Zambia. Mwiya Musokotwane: Zambia, it’s kind of like the junction point between Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa, and like South Western Africa also. Lake Tanganyika which is the world’s second longest and second largest lake by volume is partly in Zambia. The source of the largest river in southern Africa is in Zambia so it’s at the confluence of these interesting things. Tamara Winter: Zambia’s natural resources, especially copper, made it a target for colonization. But Zambia had a distinctly different experience than its neighbors. Mwiya Musokotwane: You didn’t have very militarized colonial experience as was the case elsewhere in Kenya or in South Africa. So the British were very white glove here. I think part of that is Zambia was never really seen as a place where they were going to settle…it was seen as a resource country. Tamara Winter: The British occupied what they called “Northern Rhodesia” from the late 19th century all the way until 1964. After gaining freedom Zambia began to function as a democracy. However, within a decade of independence the country was under one-party rule. Mwiya Musokotwane: Seven years later became a single party socialist state, as was the fashion in Africa those days, and you know that was basically the beginning of a long and steady decline for the country. Tamara Winter: The economy was soon in crisis and actually contracted for decades. Mwiya Musokotwane: We ended up losing three to four times our GDP per capita over the 20 years of socialism that we experienced. And then people basically got to a point where they had enough and demanded liberal democracy again. Tamara Winter: After a series of coup attempts… Archived audio: Where the rebel officers had attempted to announce they had attempted to overthrow the government because it was corrupt. Tamara Winter: …and internal struggles in the 90s, that saw former leaders imprisoned… Archived audio Kenneth Kaunda: Today, God is great indeed. I am out, but I’ve not been told why I was in the prison for five months and seven days. Tamara Winter: Zambia has once again begun the move towards a multi-party democracy. Just last fall, Hakainde Hichilema, who ran for president six times in the last 15 years, was finally elected. As recently as 2017, he too spent time in prison, accused of treason for his role in anti-corruption protests against the former president. Now, Hichilema is committed to an ambitious agenda and has already begun traveling, connecting with other world leaders… Archived audio Kamala Harris: Well it is my honor and pleasure to welcome you, Mr. President, to the White House. Tamara Winter: …working to ensure that democracy in Zambia will be bolstered by strong national institutions and a renewed commitment to economic development. Archived audio Hakainde Hichilema: For us to be able to run our countries in a manner that would deliver what we may call democratic dividends. Kamala Harris: That’s right. Hakainde Hichilema: Delivering accelerated economic growth development to offer opportunities to our people. I think, Vice President, that’s what will sustain democracy. That’s what will make democracy attractive. Tamara Winter: Hichilema grew up in a farming family and spent years in international business. His presidency promises a new era for Zambia, one focused on economic growth and greater stability in the government. Mwiya, who was born in the late 80s, grew up watching Zambia’s economic and governance struggles first hand. Now in his early 30s he wants his investment firm to be an engine of development not just for Zambia, but for all of Africa. This vision drives Mwiya’s interest in Nkwashi. You can hear the same far-reaching desire when he explains why he wanted to build a city in the first place. Mwiya Musokotwane: I was asking myself, “how can I apply this to fix these problems as opposed to being a bystander?” I started thinking about the resources I had available to me. It just so happened that my family owned a ranch about a half-hour drive out of Lusaka and it was large enough that something meaningful could be done there. Tamara Winter: Mwiya mentioned Lusaka. That’s the capital city of Zambia and the largest city in the country with between two and three million residents. It’s a bit larger than Chicago and slightly smaller than Berlin. And the problems he’s talking about? Well, the city is growing fast—faster than many of its institutions can cope with. As recently as October of last year there were major blackouts across Zambia. Power isn’t the only element of infrastructure under strain in Lusaka. It’s estimated that by 2030, the city will have a shortage of three million homes. Part of Mwiya’s drive to build a new city nearby was to add another living and working hub: one that could be a home to professionals and those who want to connect more directly with the rest of the world. Mwiya Musokotwane: Nkwashi is a satellite town to Lusaka. We like to call it a knowledge city. We’re anchoring the city on institutions of learning and it’s been designed to be able to be a home to up to 100,000 people. Tamara Winter: Those learning institutions include a 130 acre university campus and the Explorer School which provides entirely online education for primary and secondary school. Archived audio: Imagine a school without borders. A school where students and teachers come from places all around the world from Bahrain to France, from Australia to Zambia. Tamara Winter: In Zambia it is common for the children of wealthier families to be educated outside of the country, in Johannesburg or even London, where Mwiya went to school. The Explorer School also reaches across borders with students in Nigeria, India and beyond but is anchored in Nkwashi. By creating learning institutions in Zambia that are internationally connected, Mwiya hopes there will be even more reason for those seeking economic and educational advancement to stay. Mwiya Musokotwane: We’re creating these institutions that hopefully can be the engines of initial economic growth. If Explorer School and Explorer Academy are fantastically successful that then creates the natural impetus to create city number two and three and four and five. Tamara Winter: Large scale new city projects like Nkwashi sit squarely at the intersection of public and private institutions. They are often so significant in scope that they require cooperation from local and national governments, in addition to willing investors. Luckily, Mwiya was prepared to navigate both of those worlds from an early age, whether or not he was fully aware of it. Mwiya Musokotwane: I didn’t really grow up with a very boxed-in view of the world. Tamara Winter: His parents made sure of that. His father is actually one of the architects of Zambia’s financial system. Mwiya Musokotwane: He’s like a super disciplined academic type person and he’s also been a central banker and economist and policy maker. A lot of the conversations he would have would be around things to do with how to develop Zambia. How to develop Africa at large. Tamara Winter: His mother was an entrepreneur. Mwiya Musokotwane: She had her own ways of conveying similar values to us. But most of hers were more practical so I think everything I learned about business as an example, I learned from her. Tamara Winter: Growing up in a household with international business interests meant an early window into the wider world. Mwiya Musokotwane: I would go with my parents on their trips to figure out different commercial undertakings they might want to get involved in like acquiring land and stuff like that at a super young age. It created this very like, explorer type mindset in me. I think that’s stuck with me into adulthood. Tamara Winter: But Mwiya was also an introverted kid who preferred his own company. Luckily at home he was in an environment that filled him with a fierce curiosity. His parents nurtured his development—each in their own way. For example, when he was 13 his father gave him a biography of Albert Einstein. His mother? Well, she gave him The Power of Positive Thinking. Mwiya Musokotwane: You know, where my dad is taciturn, she’s more expressive. Where his interests lie in more technical facts hers are much more to do with human wellbeing. He’s taught me how to build systems and she’s taught me how to lead those systems. Tamara Winter: And now, with a project like Nkwashi, Mwiya is combining lessons from both parents. Mwiya Musokotwane: Building cities and building institutions of learning...it sits right smack on the intersection between public sector and private sector work. Tamara Winter: These projects also take a hefty dose of confidence and that ‘explorer mindset’ that Mwiya described. Like Patri Friedman and Mark Lutter, Mwiya’s interest in new cities came from his dissatisfaction with the status-quo solutions he saw being offered to the structural problems in Zambia. Without Mwiya’s imagination, the land that is now becoming Nkwashi could have been put to more mundane use. Mwiya Musokotwane: There was the possibility of just subdividing allotments and then selling those, but that also felt very boring and like, low-impact. And the possibility of building something more meaningful seemed more interesting. So we’re like, “Okay we’re going to build a city.” Tamara Winter: In the red dirt and scrub brush, Mwiya saw something possibly transformational that could reach far beyond 3,000 acres outside of Lusaka. Mwiya Musokotwane: Right now what we have is a situation where Africans regardless of where they live in the world are treated as nominal equals. It’s one thing to be equal in the law, it’s another to be equal in the way someone regards you in their hearts. And I think that’s what places like Nkwashi represent for me. Tamara Winter: Mwyia’s clear sense of purpose in building Nkwashi is not always as easy to detect in the world of new cities. Nor is the seamless mix of public and private. That intersection can sometimes be an uncomfortable one. Remember, when Paul Romer proposed the notion of charter cities, he was clear: they would be special opportunity zones run by other governments. That idea met with almost instant backlash. Isabelle Simpson: The argument is that Paul Romer’s model was too neocolonial because he would have these foreign countries come and intervene, but that when it’s private entrepreneurs because they are not bound to a particular country that it’s not neocolonial. Tamara Winter: Isabelle Simpson is a PhD candidate at McGill University studying new cities and startup societies. Isabelle Simpson: But obviously from the perspective of the local people it is very much neocolonialism. Tamara Winter: Discomfort over foreign governments running cities in other countries is part of what spurred changes in how new cities are discussed and planned. Patri Friedman of Pronomos Capital—who we heard from earlier—is especially interested in thinking of new models for charter city development. Patri Friedman: That idea that a charter city is operated by a foreign power that just didn’t fly at all. So today’s charter cities are overseen by the host country and often are public private partnerships with companies that will build and operate the city. Tamara Winter: But this model presents challenges of its own. Patri Friedman: The gold standard right now is the Honduran ZEDE system. Tamara Winter: In Honduras, laws were passed to seed the ground for new city developments. Archived audio: Honduras has began to create two of the twelve regions of development and employment also known as charter cities. Tamara Winter: Called the ZEDE laws, they were so controversial they created a constitutional crisis, and inspired multiple protest movements. Local suspicion towards new city projects has been common in Honduras. One project, Prospera, has had ongoing tensions with the population that lives near its borders. Prospera has also been criticized for its legal system. A board of seven arbiters, many of them not native to Honduras, oversee private disputes in the city. They are asked to make rulings over residents who may or may not speak English and who are governed by a code that has borrowed liberally from different existing sets of laws. That’s a pretty extreme example. Mark Lutter, the director of the Charter Cities Institute, who you heard from at the beginning of the podcast, has been critical of this particular aspect of Prospera. Champions of new cities do, however, speak glowingly about the possibilities of these kinds of mix-and-match legal systems, ones that allow laws to be switched out and updated like software. From Patri Friedman. Patri Friedman: What’s interesting to me from an infrastructure perspective is that modifying other kinds of infrastructure—power systems or sewer systems of a city—is very, very difficult but law is a virtual layer so it can be modified the same way you deploy new software builds. Tamara Winter: And the sources for these new software builds? They can come from almost anywhere. Patri Friedman: It’s a really, really interesting point of leverage to say can we essentially write better operating systems or copy the existing operating systems, that is, copy functional sets of laws and administrative procedures from countries that work well and bring them to other countries. Tamara Winter: To critics of the new city movement this description of governance sounds too straightforward. It is emblematic of the tendency of charter city advocates to oversimplify complex issues. Isabelle Simpson goes all the way back to the first moments of Paul Romer’s original TED talk as an example. Isabelle Simpson: He begins this talk by showing an Associated Press photo of African students who are sitting under streetlights at an airport and they’re sort of bent over their textbooks. Archived audio Paul Romer: Take a look at this picture. It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us. Isabelle Simpson: So already I find this sort of annoying because people have this really bad habit when they want to illustrate dysfunction or chaos they use Africa. Archived audio Paul Romer: These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don’t have any electricity at home. Isabelle Simpson: And Romer does not mention that the students are from the Republic of Guinea and the airport is the international airport there. And the year is 2007. Archived audio Paul Romer: Let’s just pick one, for example the one in the green shirt. Isabelle Simpson: Romer then gives one of the students a fictive name, “We’re going to name him Nelson.” Archived audio Paul Romer: Nelson. Isabelle Simpson: I bet Nelson has a cellphone. Archived audio Paul Romer: I’ll bet Nelson has a cellphone. So here’s the puzzle. Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting edge technology like the cell phone, but doesn’t have access to a 100 year old technology for generating electric light in the home? Now in a word the answer is rules. Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that’s available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson. Isabelle Simpson: Actually the causes of electricity blackouts here are complex and a comprehensive explanation would have required Romer to address in addition to the poor tariff structures—what he says are the ‘bad rules’—he would have had to talk about the country’s weak infrastructure, issues of transmission and distribution losses, supply shortages and lack of diversity in the electricity generation mix, corruption distorting contract negotiation, and the neocolonial economic situation that thrives on extraction by foreign companies which are the ones grabbing the most electricity at the lowest price. All these complex elements, they don’t fit into Romer’s narrative about bad rules. Tamara Winter: The reason scholars like Simpson fear this simplification is because simple-sounding problems invite simple solutions that overlook necessary complexities. Isabelle Simpson: If you say that you want to build a new city what is it exactly that you mean by city? Isn’t a city a political space where people with different opinions and different ambitions will come and debate and sort of try to create this better society all the time? Or are you trying to create this community of like-minded people which ultimately is just sort of a gated community? Tamara Winter: In addition to political questions about new cities, there are also cultural and historical ones. Juan Du is the author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City. She’s also… Juan Du: …the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto. Tamara Winter: In her book, she pushes back on the popular narrative about Shenzhen: that until 1979 it was a sparsely populated backwater. And after government investment and its designation as a special economic zone only then did its population and economic output explode. Juan Du: I think it’s important to keep in mind what accounted for Shenzhen’s rapid population growth wasn’t necessarily just top-down policy, it was a bottom-up willingness that people wanted to go there. Tamara Winter: In her book, Du unpacks how Shenzhen’s history allowed it to rapidly transform into the megacity it is today. Juan Du: The centuries of history prior to 1979 is as important as the history of the last four decades. The incredible urbanization and economic growth in Shenzhen was built up on foundations that was already preexisting and those foundations took decades if not millennium to be built. Tamara Winter: Du also takes issue with many of the popular statistics about Shenzhen pre-1979 that feed the city-built-from-scratch narrative. Juan Du: People think that in 1979 it was just a small sleeping fishing village of 30,000. First of all, there are no villages that have 30,000, especially a sleepy one and a small one at that. Shenzhen was a conglomerate of 2,000 villages and several historic townships that existed for centuries. Tamara Winter: The population of that 2,000 village conglomerate? Closer to 300,000. And it was this preexisting network that ushered contemporary Shenzhen into being. Juan Du: There are so much local and indigenous knowledge and organizations and economies and local networks and international networks of those local indigenous villages that formed and actually allowed Shenzhen to survive its most difficult start up period at the first five years, the first ten years. Tamara Winter: The willingness in the new city world to downplay this part of Shenzhen’s story in favor of a more a-historical, top-down narrative worries Du. Juan Du: City making is a very, very complex and difficult process. The misconception that Shenzhen grew from scratch that it was a blank slate or a tabula rasa is, I think, the most dangerous misconception. That one can take zero, one can take a blank sheet of paper and that all you need to do is add money and policy that you can have a city. Tamara Winter: But looking at some proposed new city projects it seems like that’s exactly what certain investors hope to do. In 2020, Hong Kong real estate developer Ivan Ko proposed a creatively named new city “Nextpolis” to be located in Ireland and populated by residents of Hong Kong who wanted to escape that city’s increasingly challenging political environment. There was also a proposal in Singapore for a floating city that could house migrant workers and move, when needed, to be near construction projects. These simple-sounding solutions point to other important questions that need to be addressed in the new city ecosystem. Like who has a say in governance. Simpson points out that many of the cities cited as examples of new city developments—Shenzhen, Dubai, Singapore—are also those with restrictive, even authoritarian, national governments. Isabelle Simpson: It’s very bizarre that charter cities entrepreneurs would use this very authoritarian model as their blueprint for this sort of pro-free market, pro-freedom, individual freedom developments that they’re trying to do. Tamara Winter: One of the most high profile new city projects currently under construction— Saudi Arabia’s NEOM—fits this mold. Archived audio: The contemporary city needs a full redesign. What if we removed cars? What if we got rid of streets? What if we innovated in the public space? Tamara Winter: Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars of government money, this ambitious plan includes everything from automated ports, to city modules spread out over hundreds of miles of desert and connected by high-speed rail. Promotional materials make it sound almost irresistible. As one Wall Street Journal article put it: it’s Disneyland meets Dubai. Archived audio: Through advanced manufacturing methods we will create green industries of the future with sustainability and reusability built into their DNA. Because any business destined to change the world, must also protect it. Tamara Winter: NEOM is part of Saudi Vision 2030, the flagship project of the authoritarian Saudi government of Muhammed bin Salman. It has ruthlessly targeted journalists, activists, and critics at home and abroad. Isabelle Simpson: Entrepreneurs who are very insistent on freedom of association, freedom of movement, freedom of speech. Their model for charter cities are authoritarian countries. Tamara Winter: Nkwashi, however, is not this kind of project. It’s being built in Zambia by someone with deep roots in the country. And it is being supported by a new administration that is committed to using economic development to build more democratic institutions. Some form of government support is crucial in creating a new city. The projects that succeed will have both government support and a significant connection to the place where they are being built. Nkwashi has that connection. Even the name of the city speaks to its Zambian roots. Mwiya Musokotwane: It means eagle and so the Zambian national bird is the fish eagle and so we decided to name the city after the national bird and we chose to name it in a language that was indigenous to the area. Tamara Winter: However, these close ties don’t mean the city and the ideas that come along with it will be instantly adopted. Mwiya Musokotwane: I think people think of us as being fairly forward-thinking and maybe a little bit crazy sometimes, but I think in a good way. Tamara Winter: Some might view Nkwashi as ‘crazy’ but that hasn’t really harmed its popularity. Mwiya Musokotwane: And you know we sold out in like three months; that initial batch of I think 80 five-acre plots, it was. Tamara Winter: And Mwiya firmly believes in the mission behind Nkwashi—not just the city, but what it could represent. Mwiya Musokotwane: I see Nkwashi as a beta, as a proof of concept. Speaking as an African, I think one of the challenges Africa has had is we haven’t yet done really big interesting things as a continent—the kind of things where people look at them and say, “Oh wow that’s like super cool that has a lot of positive impact not just for Africa but for the world at large.” Tamara Winter: That drive to change perception is a personal one for Mwiya, shaped by experiences he had during his university years in London. At 17, he left Zambia, hopeful and a bit apprehensive. Tamara Winter: He made friends quickly and found community in the classroom. However, while in London he also experienced everyday racism. This might not sound that revelatory—a young African man encountering racism in early 2000s London. What makes these experiences so important is the way Mwiya talks about them. Mwiya Musokotwane: Running in the train station to catch the train and then policemen in the train station stop you like, “Where are you running to?” I’m in a train station, it’s obvious I’m going to catch a train. You know, it’s interactions like that where I felt like I was nominally equal. Tamara Winter: Did you catch that? Nominally equal. Mwiya uses the same words talking about these incidents as he does when describing the necessity of Nkwashi. If Nkwashi is proof of concept and other similar new cities can be built around Africa, Mwiya hopes that—in time—through the educational and institutional development they bring, the international perception of Africa and Africans can change. In the end, there are as many questions about the future of new cities now as there were twelve years ago when Romer gave his talk. Maybe even more since there are real projects being launched. I was once a die-hard evangelist for new cities, a true believer. I still see the promise in the model, but now I approach the subject with more humility. Basically I’m trying to remember how little I know about what the next decades of new city development will entail. The world of new cities is shifting all the time. There have been some major changes just in the last few weeks. Remember the ZEDE laws in Honduras? They don’t even exist any more! They were unanimously repealed by Honduras’ national congress. I’m still optimistic that some version of new cities will fit into the fabric of solutions to economic challenges. But I also recognize that, in 30 years, the actual model or models that succeed may look very different from many of the projects that have been proposed so far. In the meantime, knowing there are people like Mwiya out there, thoughtful enough to meaningfully consider the big questions facing their societies and daring enough to work on audacious solutions, gives me a lot of hope.

Visit press.stripe.com to learn more about Stripe Press. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the first episode of this podcast you heard excerpts from my interview with Juan Du. She is the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto and the author of The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City. In our conversation she offers insights into Shenzhen’s history, explains the personal connection to the city that inspired her to spend 15 years writing a book about it, and reveals why she thinks the ‘Shenzhen Experiment,’ as she calls it, is far from over. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Dean Juan Du. Tamara Winter: So we’ll start with the hardest question first. Tell me your name, your academic affiliations, and why I’m talking to you right now. Juan Du: The why I’m not sure if I can tell you! So, hello, my name is Juan Du, I am the Dean of the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto in Canada. And I recently relocated in the last six months from Hong Kong to Toronto. So it’s nice to be speaking with you. Tamara Winter: And tell me, so you’re an architect by trade. I would love if you could tell me a little bit about your background. How did you end up writing this book? Because, well you know certainly Shenzhen’s architecture is mentioned, that isn’t really the defining feature of the book. And maybe you could tell folks what the name of your book is as well. Juan Du: Sure. So the book is called The Shenzhen Experiment: The Story of China’s Instant City and the book as it was published is probably the fifth evolution of it or reincarnation of it. I didn’t start out by writing such a book because I am trained in architecture. And I started out to write a more architectural book about the city and specifically about the urban villages of the city. However, as I started to uncover more and more about the urban villages, I discovered a larger story really at the story of the city and the story of China. It is a story that I think is very misunderstood. It essentially is the story of China in the last 40 years and how that is contextualized within a broader understanding of the history of China, perhaps over a few centuries. So it just became a much bigger book, perhaps not in length, but in scope, the more I researched and worked on that. One of the first reasons why I wanted to write the book is actually based in my first hand experience of planning and design projects in Shenzhen. And I came across this deep history and vibrant, overlooked, urban neighborhoods that is not present in the way that Shenzhen is typically portrayed in either national media in China and especially international media in the world. It’s usually portrayed as the city without history, the city without any important pre-urbanization culture or people of significance. And that was just very much contrary to what my own experiences and later my own research uncovered. So this is why I decided to take on this challenge of writing this book. And it was very difficult for me, precisely because I wasn’t trained particularly to write such an expansive book, but it was very much a learning journey. And with these knowledge and lessons that I’ve uncovered over a decade of research and writing, I think it does contribute back to my own discipline of architecture and urban planning and design, but also I hope it contributes to others who are interested in economics, politics, geography, environmental transformation, whether it is in the Chinese context or anywhere else in the world. Tamara Winter: For anyone who isn’t familiar, what is Shenzhen? Where is it? And maybe you can answer this now, or I can ask it again in just a little bit, why is Shenzhen such a significant city? Juan Du: Sure. I’ll start with the ‘where’ first, maybe. So Shenzhen is located in southern China. It’s at the southern east most tip of China, just north of a river from Hong Kong. And the river is called the Shenzhen River. And this river is the border between the city of Shenzhen and the city of Hong Kong. And it used to also be an international border that you know defined between China and colonial era Hong Kong, which was ruled by the British. So it is a very interesting location. I would also say that what’s a unique geographical feature, in addition to where it’s located, is the people via one fact: it is the only city in China’s southern region where the primary dialogue is not Cantonese, which is the southern dialogue of China. The primary dialogue in Shenzhen is Mandarin, which is a typically northern dialogue that people have used to speak everywhere in China. So this is not to say that Shenzhen is a northern city, but it really testifies to the cosmopolitan nature of the city, that it is located in the southern tip. And it has a very rich southern history of China, but it is a city of migrants from all across China. And it’s really, I would say the most diverse city in China in terms of the backgrounds of people and where they’re from geographically and perhaps also socioeconomically. And I think that for me, is what makes it a significant city. And I would say that it also makes Shenzhen the most dynamic city in China today because of that mixture, because of that diversity. And it has this extreme mixture of low tech and high tech industries, it has this extreme mixture of urban and rural cultures. It has this extreme mixture of kind of the very local regional quality of a southern city with international enterprises and international headquarters via where it is and its unique history. It’s also significant if we want to speak about numbers, it’s also significant in terms of its population number. It is a city of 20 million people, which makes it a rare mega city in the world, 20 million. But what makes it more unique is that in the 1970s, the population in Shenzhen was 300,000. So it went from 300,000 to 10 million in two decades. And then when it was 10 million in the early 2000s, everyone said, “Well, this is it. This must be it. I mean, Shenzhen has reached this potential. It’s no longer unique. It’s no longer special.” Yet, over the following decade and two decades, it continued to grow into where it is today, a city, 20 million people. And that makes it an internationally significant city because that type of population growth, not only is it unprecedented in China, it’s unprecedented in the world, anywhere, at any moment of history, in the world. Tamara Winter: I really appreciate that because you just flagged Shenzhen’s population in the '70s. I’m going to come back and ask you a question about that because when I was working at the Charter Cities Institute, I was under the impression that the population was actually 30,000, but there’s a very particular reason why you used the 300,000 number. Juan Du: Yeah. Tamara Winter: But there were a lot of people who speak as though Shenzhen’s history began in 1979. Why was 1979 such a significant year for China more broadly? Juan Du: Right. So 1979 is a very significant year for both Shenzhen and China. In 1979 was the year, the city of Shenzhen was established, meaning it was formally designated as an urban unit. So prior to 1979, the region was called Bao’an county, which was a rural county in the province of Guangdong. So in 1979, it was designated on this special entity as a city of Shenzhen, but the further significance of 1979 to both Shenzhen and China is because 1979 was the year China, via the central government in Beijing, launched China’s reform and opening. It was basically the beginning of a series of economic and sociopolitical reforms that entirely pivoted China’s economy and culture onto the world stage and into the identity of what China is today, internationally. I think for anyone who perhaps do not have that particular memory or anyone who’s younger than 50, I would imagine that they would be very shocked if they’re shown images or facts about what China was like in the 1960s and '70s, including anyone who’s younger than 50 in China today. The year 1979 to launch, it was a very pivotal moment and pivotal year. It’s not to say everything was instant.1979 launched the reform and opening. 1979 established the city of Shenzhen, but the first decade of that was very rocky. It was very difficult. It was very challenging. Shenzhen was very close to being shut down multiple times, reform opening policies was close to shut down multiple times. It wasn’t until the mid 1990s, right, almost two decades after 1979, did it stabilize and the country and the city had enough confidence that this is definitely the right direction for the city and for the country. Tamara Winter: And for anybody who doesn’t already know, how did allowing Shenzhen, designating it as a special economic zone, change the city? I mean, you’ve alluded now to population growth. I’m also curious about GDP growth and more broadly how Shenzhen’s success really impacted the whole country. Juan Du: In 1979, what was initiated was not only the city of Shenzhen, there also was initiated a policy to create special economic zones. And in 1979, Shenzhen was one of four special economic zones that was created. So what makes Shenzhen’s beginning as a city unique is that within that year, it was both a city and a special economic zone in China. There are many conversations about special economic zones. It continued to be used almost like a miracle growth formula in the world today, especially in developing economies and cities, what it meant for China at that time for Shenzhen, at that time by special economic zone, it simply meant within the designated special economic zone of Shenzhen, which was only actually the southern half of the city of Shenzhen. But within that special economic zone that the zone and the city government had the power to create an experiment with various policies and various mechanisms that was not legal, that was not allowed and not existent outside of the zone. And I also think sociopolitical reforms and policies that were experimented with, that at the time was not possible anywhere else in China. For example, at that time, if you were not born in a particular city and had its local residency status, which is called Hukou in China, you cannot legally work in anywhere but that city. You cannot get a job, you cannot get housing, you cannot get married anywhere else, but that city. It was very much mechanism of economic and population management system in China, let’s say, that it was a planned economy. But because Shenzhen was designated as a special economic zone, in Shenzhen if you were a migrant from somewhere else, from another city, from a rural region, from a village, you could get a job. You could go to school, you could rent a home, you could get married, you could make so many decisions about your own life that at the time in China, you couldn’t. And that’s why it was significant. And I would say, that’s what attracted people to go there. So what makes it unique, it’s not only the number and the population growth. I think the question is that why did all these people go there? That’s one of the biggest, I think overlooked lessons. Shenzhen as is being discussed either as a charter city precedent or model, or as a special economic zone model. I think it’s important to keep in mind, is that what accounted for Shenzhen’s rapid population growth wasn’t necessarily just top down policy. It was a bottom up willingness that people wanted to go there. People were not forced to go there. People were not sent to go there. People left the comfort of their home. People left the comfort of their jobs and their families to go to, at the time, I said the first decade was very difficult for Shenzhen, but people left the comfort of their home. And under a planned economy, if you had a job, you had that job for life. It may not be a job you love, but you had it. You had housing, you had a job, you had your basic social networks. Within those first decade, the type of people that the city attracted were a very unique type of people. It was people who was more adventurous, it was people who is entrepreneurial. It was people who are not satisfied with what life offered them in wherever they were. So what makes Shenzhen a really interesting case study for me is a much more closer understanding of what propels people, what would attract someone to whichever place or whichever socioeconomic costs are coming from. What would attract someone to leave everything they know, and go to this place and believe that it is a land and opportunity. And to the testament of Shenzhen, even though there has been, of course, many people who arrived in Shenzhen and couldn’t make it and left, but many more did stay, right? The fact that it started with the population 300,000, now it’s 20 million. We’re basically talking about 20 million migrants, 20 million people, because it’s only within four decades, right? New population growth. Those were born in Shenzhen is still not the majority of the 20 million. The majority of the 20 million are migrants from everywhere else. They went to Shenzhen and they were able to, despite whatever challenges of a new environment, changing policy, they were able to take root and take advantage of the various unique opportunities that the city have offered and was able to make their homes there. Tamara Winter: You went to Shenzhen, I believe in 2005, I love that the book kind of starts and ends in the same place. Forgive me if I say this wrong, in Baishizhou, what did you see when you first got to Shenzhen and why is that specific village so significant to you? Juan Du: I did use Baishizhou, a particular urban village, as a historical site and device to open the book and end the book. And there are personal reasons. And I think for me also intellectual reasons to want to do that. Personal reasons is that in 2005, I was working in Beijing at the time and I was flying to Shenzhen to work. And I would fly to Shenzhen once every week or every two weeks. I’d fly in in the morning and I’d leave in the last flight out, because why would I want to stay in Shenzhen, it’s a city with no history, no culture. I’m only going there on business. And then one day my meeting ran over, the city official, the urban planner that I became very good friends with decades later was driving a bit too slow, going to the airport. And I missed my flight. So the city put me up in a hotel. It was a place called Overseas Chinese Town, O-C-T, which is the nicest neighborhood in Shenzhen. It has these kind of Italian villas. It has a very famous theme park. It has these tree-lined streets and some business hotels. So I was put there to stay for the night and take my first flight out the next morning. And in the hotel room, I couldn’t sleep. So I thought maybe a walk would do it. So I started walking and got lost and walked into this incredible scene, this was probably past midnight already, of a city square with everyone full of people at midnight, full of people, cooking and eating and this outdoor market, lots of kids running around. And I described it as seeing, I think in my book rather cinematically, but it was a very cinematic experience. It was as if I discovered this new world that no one had told me about, none of the architects and planners and government officials I had met at that time in Shenzhen, because I was just starting to understand the city has ever mentioned such a place of urban villages. None of what I’ve read about the city have talked about it. So it was just this incredible thing. And then later I was to understand that Baishizhou is the city’s largest and most populous urban village. It has this incredible history that I speak about in the book, I think in one of the chapters. And I did decide to end, I believe it was the last chapter on Baishizhou as well to, in some ways to talk about what started out as a very touristic understanding of what the urban village is and what the city is. But after a decade and a half of researching and interacting and learning from the local residents and the local scholars, I start to really have a much deeper understanding. However, by, at the end of the 15 years, Baishizhou was in the process of being cleared out for demolition. So I really wanted to be able to include that part in the book to really put in some ways a sense of urgency to what I wanted to call out to attention of both the people in Shenzhen, people in China, people everywhere else is that very often what’s happening through an urbanization process of so-called urban renewal, what we are demolishing, which on the surface might cosmetically look as if it shouldn’t be there, that in fact is the very heart and engine of what made that city vibrant and important in the first place. And that, for me, I think has a certain degree of urgency and has a degree of importance to be able to share with an international audience. Tamara Winter: Your book does, I think a masterful job of pointing out many misconceptions that people have about Shenzhen, whether it’s that Shenzhen’s success should primarily be attributed to top down government, to the idea that Shenzhen before the city kind of grew to become what we know it to be today, had no one there and it was just kind of this like back woods village and the land was pretty insignificant. So I’m wondering if you could tell me what are maybe some of the sort of most jarring misconceptions that people have about Shenzhen and why was it so important to you to kind of take pains to correct them? Juan Du: The reason why it’s important for me to put that front and center is because I had those very same misperceptions and misconceptions of the city when I started first going there. But what’s different between myself and perhaps the greater media perhaps is that my misconceptions are very quickly dispelled by me understanding the city more, but then is to watch that those misconceptions, not only did it stay throughout the decade and half I was researching and writing the book, they actually grew, it grew in their status. And it grew in the number of people who held them, it was primarily at first just kind of a national discussion. And then it became an international, Shenzhen became an international model city. And with Shenzhen’s reputation rising in the last decade, the misconceptions also arose in their importance and impact. So I thought it was really important to outline that and to say that this is why I’m writing the book, is I wanted people to have an understanding that not only is Shenzhen not the way that is commonly being perceived. In fact, it is the exact opposite. That’s what I think is really intriguing and unfortunate to me about these misconceptions of Shenzhen, and there’s many. But I think for the purpose for the book and for the purpose of me trying to create it more succinctly and communicate them, I had outlined that there was misconceptions of time, misconceptions of people, misconceptions of purpose. So misconceptions of time, we spoke about the fact that Shenzhen was established as a city in 1979. And for the most part, we’ve been speaking about the city’s growth in the past four decades and how that paralleled or instigates, actually, the growth of China in terms of economics in the past four decades. However, if you have read my book, you understand that in the book, I take pains to research and create evidence to show that the centuries of history prior to 1979 is as important as the history of the last four decades. And that if we did not understand what had happened in Shenzhen in the region in China prior to 1979, there could be no understanding of why Shenzhen was created. Why there was this special economic zone. Why China launched the reform opening. And most importantly, I think I wanted to evidence and I hope it was compelling to anyone who has read the book that the incredible urbanization and economic growth in Shenzhen in the past four decades absolutely was built up on foundations that was already preexistent in the region. And those foundations took decades, if not millennium, to be built. And that if Shenzhen was what people think it was in 1979, and this is where the misconception at place is also one of the misconception is that people think that in 1979, it was just a small sleeping fishing village of 30,000. First of all, there are no villages that has 30,000, especially a sleepy one and small one at that. But Shenzhen was not a small sleeping fishing village. Even if we don’t look at the population statistics, Shenzhen was a conglomerate of 2,000 villages and several historic townships that existed for centuries. And this is really important to understand the region and this particular place, the people, the geography, the fact that it was a port, the fact that it had these rivers, the fact that it had all of this land, that was cultivated. So that geographic understanding is really important because the misconception that Shenzhen grew from scratch, that it was a blank slate or tabula rasa is I think the most dangerous misconception that one can take zero, one can take a blank sheet of paper and that all you need to do is add money and policy that you can have a city. So I think that really is the biggest and most dangerous misconception of Shenzhen because that’s not how it happened. And the reason why I say it’s the most dangerous misconception is that Shenzhen now has been used as a model city in the context of charter cities, in the context of new cities, in the context of special economic zones, to demonstrate that not only is it possible to grow a city from blank, to plan a city from nothing. And all you had to do is add foreign direct investment. Not only is it not that, it’s the opposite of that. There was so much local indigenous knowledge and organizations and economies and local networks and international networks of those local indigenous villages that formed and actually allowed Shenzhen to survive its most difficult start up period at the first five years, the first 10 years. And this is really something that I’m very passionate about to advocate because I believe in the importance of cities, I even believe in charter cities as something that’s important to talk about, I believe that we can make new cities and make it livable and attractive, but we also need to understand that it’s not just add money or just add policy, there is no miracle growth in this way that it is city making. It’s a very, very complex and difficult process. And if my study of Shenzhen hopefully can evidence is that it’s really important to understand that preexisting geography of people, history, culture of that place and that we should see those existing geographies, not as something to get rid of, not as a inconvenience, not as a nuisance, but really see them as the key ingredient, the seeds, if you will, that can contribute to the success of the future new city or the future new charter city. Tamara Winter: I think a lesser understood part of Shenzhen’s kind of contribution to the world, its cultural contributions. There’s a music video that you reference. This is around the time that you’re starting to get the first music videos coming out of China and these music videos are being shot literally as the city is being constructed. And one thing you’ve taken quite a lot of care to sort of show, not tell people about, and whether it’s in your book or in your appearances since then, is the real spirit of the people in Shenzhen. Juan Du: Yeah. So, I think in the book, I say one evidence, the first master plan of Shenzhen was based on a anticipation of a population 1 million by 2010. And by all accounts, that was a very ambitious master plan. There are not many cities that was able to go from scratch to 1 million. It was already a very ambitious plan, top down planning, many cities who’s been planned to have city of 1 million do not have any, right. There are many ghost towns, whether in China or elsewhere, more top down planned cities fail than succeed. So the top down planning from policy, from resources, infrastructure, housing, central funding, what have you, anticipated population of 1 million by 2010. The actual population in 2010 in Shenzhen was 10 million, 10 times more than what was planned via policy and the various instruments of that, whether economic or spatial. So 90% was unanticipated bottom up, right? 90% was just, people wanted to go there. And this is where the importance of the urban village I was speaking about earlier because the city was planned with its infrastructure, whether it’s housing, schools, hospitals, restaurants, to serve a particular proportion of the population. Who made up for the 90%? The local communities, the local villages, they turned their own houses into rental housing. And then once they had rental housing, the new migrants opened up restaurants. So what’s interesting of Baishizhou is that you can walk into any street in Baishizhou, and you can, within one hour, sample food from all over China, because they’re all opened by migrants from all over China. So this is what I mean by that I think we have underestimated the powers of bottom up action and bottom up growth. And because the book is intended for a general intellectual audience, I do not put too much academic or theoretical terms in there, but that aligns with my own work, in understanding informal urbanization, informal settlements, and to understand how communities build their own housing, build their own economy, build their own social network and social systems. And I’ve come to really understand that for a city to be a healthy, vibrant, expanding city, you need both formal or top down policy and planning and governance. It’s not just, that’s not important. It’s very important without that 10%, right? Without that top down, there would’ve been no Shenzhen. But this other part, the informal growth, the informal settlements, kind of these informal networks that very much is tied into and contributed to that formal economy, that formal policy, you need that without the informal on the bottom up, there would be no Shenzhen as we understand it today, and we would not be speaking about it and I would not have written a book and it would not be cited in India and Africa, Honduras, Ireland, wherever it is around the world as a model city, right? Because that top down aspect, that kind of planning aspect is actually quite standard, but it’s this kind of how these policies, when emerged with the local population of the preexisting villages and were emerged with all of these people from all around the country, coming into this one city and all collectively believing in the possibility of the new. That is an incredible, I think, a social, psychological experiment. So, I go back to why I called my book The Shenzhen Experiment is because I think that it is very much an experimental city. It was set up as an experiment for China to experiment with, can you have market economy in a communist country? But I think its significance goes way beyond that. It’s an experimental city in understanding human nature. It’s an experimental city in understanding both the incredible opportunities of urbanization and rapid growth, but also the native impacts on the environment on the geography of rapid urbanization. You know, the fact that it’s the state of where it is today, of being say a mega city of between 10 million to 20 million people, it’s only in the last two decades. That makes it one of the world’s youngest cities and newest experiments. I think in the conclusion of my book, I said, “I think the Shenzhen experiment’s far from over.” So I am always very uncomfortable, even myself to make any very declarative or conclusive comments about Shenzhen, because I think we don’t really understand it yet. Despite the fact that I’ve spent these time researching into it and reading everything I can about Shenzhen and southern China, I think there’s still so many more we don’t know about the city. There’s so much more lessons to uncover. So I think this experiment continues and where the city is today and where it’s going to go, it’s an open question. It’s an absolute open question. So for me, is that there’s so much for us to learn about this city and for the knowledge and experience of the city to benefit both cities and governance and also individuals in China, in Asia, but also I think there’s a lot of lessons to offer to people from all around the world, whether they’re decision makers or they’re citizens themselves. In the book, I do highlight a number of individuals I have met. Some of them are historical figures, and some of them are common everyday people and how their own lives were impacted by the urbanization of the city. But also I wanted to show how they, as individuals contributed to the city and ultimately shaped the city. And one thing I always like to remind myself and remind everyone else, that 20 million sounds like a monolith block. It’s very common for when, especially in the American context, when we look at Chinese cities or when we look at China, we see these huge gigantic numbers and that just automatically turns apart your brain into thinking that is monolith. But I do want to highlight that it’s 20 million of individuals and it’s 20 million individuals not unlike you and I. It’s 20 million individuals who have their strengths and weaknesses, who have their own neuroses, who have their emotional baggage. And these individuals, whether they’re mayors or they’re construction workers, they have had and continue to have influences in shaping the city and that’s whether it’s in Shenzhen or elsewhere. And that ultimately is something that I really would like for, especially the English reading audience and especially the North American audience, to have a more humanistic understanding of Shenzhen, to have a more humanistic understanding of China, to have a more humanistic understanding of cities that in one country or in one city, there are so many diverse views and so many different diverse entities and that individuals, nationalities, places of residence should not be grouped in within one overarching understanding about one particular country. Imagine if that be the case in the reverse, right. Do we, as individuals, want to be defined by the overall message that came out of the U.S in the past five years? I would think not. So in the same way, I would also ask everyone to have the curiosity, to try to understand whether it’s China or India or Africa or France, to understand the nuances of these political situations, and to understand the difference between national politics and individual rights and individual dreams.

I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Tamara Winter: Earlier this year I visited California’s Salton Sea for the first time. I went with my friend and colleague Everett Katigbak. He’s a producer on this podcast, and you’ll hear from him throughout this episode. It was his first trip back in over 20 years. Everett Katigbak: It just surprised me how little has changed. But also seeing the lake itself was kind of surprising. When I was standing there the other day, it’s a no man’s land. It’s literally scenes out of Mad Max. I know we say that kind of jokingly, but you can really envision it. Tamara Winter: Since the waters of the Colorado River rushed into the Salton Basin in 1905, the lake they created has been a source of promise and conflict. Now it’s shrinking, and has become one of the most polluted bodies of water in the country. It’s also poised to become one of the largest sources of lithium in the United States. As the world transitions from gas to electric vehicles, demand for lithium is increasing rapidly. And so is interest in the Salton Sea. The potential for investment and industry could be transformational for the area. But what will that transformation look like? What impact will lithium extraction have on local communities? And what can examining the history of the Salton Sea reveal about its present and future? Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host Tamara Winter. In the first episode of Beneath the Surface we looked at charter cities. New urban developments built almost from scratch through financial investment and political will. In this episode we’re visiting a very different kind of place. Everett Katigbak: So we’re here in Salton City. This is, I think the largest community out here around the Salton Sea. Tamara Winter: The communities that have grown near the Salton Sea are unincorporated. And include everything from off-the-grid artist communities to half-inhabited suburban developments. The fate of these communities is tied to the sea. When it was a tourist destination they felt the benefits. But that opportunity has long since dried up, along with the sea. Now, the promise of becoming a ‘lithium valley’ is bringing a wave of development that could breathe new life into the area. I mentioned my colleague Everett. Well, when we started talking about doing an episode on the history and future of Salton Sea, we found out that Everett and his family have a stake in the area. At the tail end of the Salton Sea’s resort era, his family bought some land there. Hoping, like many, that it was an up-and-coming oasis. Everett Katigbak: This is the place where when I was young my parents actually bought a plot of land. We’re literally standing on this plot of land. Around it there’s a handful of homes, but for the most part it’s a bunch of empty lots out here. It is a very picturesque view. It’s like a postcard. But I imagine the closer you get to it the less photogenic it gets. Tamara Winter: You have a daughter Drew. How do you hope she experiences the Salton Sea? Do you think in her lifetime it might get, I don’t know, poppin’? Everett Katigbak: I don’t know…I don’t imagine she’ll have any connection to it. I never talked about it growing up. It’s just something I totally forgot about. The more my parents are getting older and thinking they need to let go of this place the more I’m hearing about the lithium stuff. So for me it’s something that I kind of want to hold onto for a little longer and see if something happens. Tamara Winter: In the early 20th century, major construction projects were underway across southern California. Engineers planned irrigation canal networks to bring water to arid corners of the California desert. The dream at the time was to provide water for farming to the scorching hot Imperial Valley where temperatures regularly spike well above 100 degrees. Rain rarely falls. And snow has been recorded only once in the last century. But nature had other plans. For millennia, the Colorado River had occasionally made its way into the Salton Basin, creating lakes. But in the spring and summer of 1905 multiple floods wore down and eventually broke through the canal gates. And water poured into the basin. Initial attempts to close off the flow of water failed miserably. Another flood in November swept away the hastily constructed dams of gravel and brush. For two years the water flowed. And for two years crews worked around the clock. In sweltering temperatures. Under the threat of multi million-gallon flash floods. To redirect the river. When the water was finally stopped, the newly formed Salton Sea covered over 400 square miles. The early years of the Sea were mostly quiet. Naturalists categorized the many species of birds that began to congregate on its shores. The Salton Sea Wildlife Refuge was created. During the Second World War the sea became a source for fish when German u-boats made the ocean too dangerous. The military used the sea for bombing exercises. In fact, the crew that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima flew practice missions over the Salton Sea. The sea, however, was already shrinking and becoming saltier and saltier. But this didn’t stop interest in the sea from growing during the postwar economic boom. One of the people who moved to the Salton Sea after World War II was Helen Burns. She and her family made their home on a small plot of land owned by her father. Her daughter Donna Kennedy—who was barely more than a toddler at the time—remembers those early years well. Donna Kennedy: She moved us down to the Salton Sea into a trailer which had an adjacent outhouse. And we had a standpipe where we could stand and bathe. It didn’t make any difference that we were nude because no one else was there, it was completely deserted, just us. Tamara Winter: Living in the semi-wild meant Donna and her sister had a unique childhood. Donna Kennedy: We did a lot of swimming in the sea, it was very clean then. Sandy beach and very lovely. So my sister and I would just frolic in the water and the sagebrush and try to catch lizards and avoid snakes and scorpions too, we didn’t care for scorpions. Tamara Winter: Helen, however, had big dreams. She set up a makeshift stand built out of a piano box and some palm fronds. Truck drivers. Immigrants trekking up from Mexico. Occasional tourists. They all stopped by Helen’s for soda, coffee, postcards, or tubes of Salton Sea sand. Business grew. And so did the number of tourists. The Salton Sea became a destination, marketed as an inland resort—the next Palm Springs. By the 1950s the Salton Sea was the place to be. And Helen expanded to meet the demand. Donna Kennedy: Basically if you wanted to have some fun you went to Helen’s. At her high point she had a marina, a boat dock, gas tanks. A campground. Besides the bar and restaurant, the motel, but I’d say by 1958 things were really moving. On 4th of July she had hell divers and people water skied across the sea and back and got trophies and wore little horns. On New Years she had icebreakers and people skied across and back. There was the Miss Salton Sea Contest, the Mr. Salton Sea Contest. There were treasure trails where people went across the desert in their dune buggies and they’d try to find all the treasures she had hidden…it was just roaring with activity. Tamara Winter: Helen even earned a new title: Queen of the Salton Sea.Helen wasn’t the only one who saw the promise of the sea in the 50s and 60s. Other entrepreneurs, sensing opportunity, hitched their fortunes to the sea. The newly formed Salton City grew and grew. Promotional videos from the time show a desert oasis, a paradise of crystalline waters and inviting beaches. The future for Salton Sea couldn’t have looked brighter. Archived audio: In an article appearing in the The Los Angeles Times April 17th, 1966, Salton City was chosen by a group of planners, architects, administrative officers, politicians, professors, and associated thinkers as one of the 24 major cities in southern California in the year 2000. Tamara Winter: By the late 1960s and early 1970s however, tourism was drying up. And so was the sea. The water level dropped so significantly and the salt level rose so much, environmental observers worried that the fish and birds that lived in and around the sea would begin to die. The lack of rainfall in the Imperial Valley meant that the sea’s main source of new water was agricultural runoff. Which brought with it pesticides. Soon birds began dying and algae bloomed in the once clear waters. Resorts closed or scraped by with reduced clientele. When powerful tropical storms ripped through the Imperial Valley in the mid-70s many packed up for good. Archived audio: Whacko: It used to be a real nice dinner house owned by Bill and Maxine McClaren. Huell Howser: What happened to it? Whacko: Eh, the floods. Huell Howser: Uh huh. Whacko: They kinda split up, well, actually it’s the floods what did it. Tamara Winter: By 2000, Salton City was far from being one of southern California’s major cities as the LA Times had predicted. In fact, its population shrank to less than 1,000. Most people who have heard of the Salton Sea are probably familiar with this era of its life - from the 70s to the present. In the popular imagination, it has existed for almost 50 years as a polluted, decaying, steadily salinating space populated either by die-hards left over from its boom years, or those looking for off-the-grid living in the surrounding desert. Less than an hour south of the sea, the unincorporated community of Slab City grew on the remains of a defunct military base. Artists, dropouts, and others seeking a life outside of mainstream society congregated in the desert in what is now affectionately referred to as “The Last Free Place in America.” When we visited Salton Sea, Everett made a trip out to The Slab and talked to some of the colorful residents. Wizard: Greetings and welcome to East Jesus! I am your mediocre half-assed tour guide. I don’t give tours. Tamara Winter: That’s Wizard. Wizard: I spend six months here and six months in India or Vietnam. Tamara Winter: If you meet him, his name makes a lot of sense. He’s got this long dusty gray beard that he’s clearly been growing for several decades and he speaks with the confidence of someone who could conjure a rabbit out of a hat. Wizard: This is a sheltered workshop for the work ethic impaired. They’re not lazy. They’re work ethic impaired. Tamara Winter: East Jesus is a massive collaborative art piece. Wizard: It’s a work of over 2,000 artists. And they would come here and they’d be inspired by the art. They would create art. Tamara Winter: It’s about 50 miles from where Everett’s family has their plot of land in Salton City. On the other side of the sea. But the environmental disaster at the sea touches both communities. As the sea evaporates in the baking desert sun, dust rises from the exposed lakebed. Wizard: The wind blows all this toxicity towards San Diego and LA and Imperial County doesn’t have the money to do anything but San Diego and LA does. If it affects them, they’ll do something about it. Archived audio: Sort of fine white powdery dust sits on top of the playa…and a very small wind will blow that and…I’ve been out here at times when it looked like a snow blizzard, you couldn’t see anything. Tamara Winter: Faced with looming environmental and human crises, the state of California has created commissions. Convened taskforces. And made multimillion—even multibillion—dollar promises to restore the sea. But these plans, some of which have been debated for almost two decades, have not changed the day-to-day reality for many who live in the area. Now the Salton Sea is at a crossroads. It is a potentially vast source of lithium - an essential ingredient in the batteries that power the green economy. Audrey Carleton: Lithium, it’s been called “white gold” it’s kind of this like crucial element in the move towards electric vehicles and the move away from oil and gas. Tamara Winter: That’s Audrey Carleton. Audrey Carleton: I am an environmental journalist for Vice. I wrote this story on the Salton Sea becoming sort of this new quote-un-quote “lithium valley” through this deal that General Motors has with Controlled Thermal Resources. Tamara Winter: Leading car companies are increasing the number of electric vehicles they can produce. Tesla made headlines last fall for having a market valuation greater than Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, Ford, and GM combined. But GM’s stated transformative goals set them apart. Audrey Carleton: General Motors is kind of paving the way. So, they made a first in the nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. Archived audio: Person 1: General Motors plans to stop making gas powered cars by 2035… Person 2: On the assembly line at this GM plant outside Detroit there are two things autoworkers…will never see again internal combustion engines, and gas tanks. Audrey Carleton: Because they are like the American automaker and they’ve made this kind of first commitment to be all EV by that period of time they are really kind of setting a standard for other automakers. Tamara Winter: Right now it’s estimated that almost 30% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United states come from transportation. So it’s understandable why GM’s plans are so ambitious. And their dedication to lithium mining is so strong. Audrey Carleton: They’re really sort of trying to carve themselves out as a leader in the EV space in doing so and in order to make that happen they’re going to need a lot of lithium so General Motors struck up a deal with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to mine for lithium for lithium ion batteries to go in electric vehicles. Tamara Winter: Enter the Salton Sea. The US Department of Energy estimates that the sea could be the source of up to 600,000 tons of lithium. Per year. In fact, the Salton Sea is… Michael McKibben: …the largest brine source of lithium in the world. Tamara Winter: That’s Dr. Michael McKibben. He’s an Emeritus Professor of Geology at the University of California Riverside. He’s also one of the authors of a recent report on energy resources—including lithium—at the Salton Sea. To understand how lithium will be extracted at Salton Sea, we first need to talk about why it’s there in the first place. That’s a journey that starts millions of years ago, and thousands of miles away. The Colorado River snakes and curves across the southwestern United States passing through parts of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and finally California. The waters of the river have traveled that route for millions of years slowly eating away at sandstone and sediment. It was these waters that carved out the Grand Canyon. Over millennia the river carried all of the rock and mineral it eroded away. Occasionally, when hard rains fell, or there was heavy snowmelt in the Rockies, the river waters rose. And in southern California, the river would burst its banks and the parched Imperial Valley would be filled. Temporarily. The ancient lakes that formed became central to the lives and mythologies of the native peoples who lived in the area. Quechans, Chemehuevis, Cahuillas, and Kumeyaays gathered on the lake’s shores and fished their waters. The presence of these lakes can still be seen. The largest and most recent, called Lake Cahuilla, left what are called ‘bathtub rings’, or marks on the surrounding rockfaces indicating where its waters once stopped. Repeated flooding and evaporation over thousands of years left behind sediment full of minerals and trace metals, picked up as the river rushed from the Rockies to the sea. Among those metals: lithium. A lot of lithium. Dr. Michael McKibben explains just how much. Michael McKibben: Sort of back of the envelope calculation estimates I’ve done are somewhere on the order of two million to six million metric tons of lithium. Tamara Winter: A million, or six million, of anything is a lot, but Dr. McKibben puts those numbers into perspective. Michael McKibben: You know, even if we just produce a faction of it every year we could supply all US needs for lithium and actually have enough left over to export it to other countries. That would totally reverse the situation the U.S. is in where we’re now importing over 95% of the lithium we need. Tamara Winter: Right now, most lithium is mined outside the United States. Australia, Chile, Argentina, and China are all home to robust mining operations. But it’s not just the fact that the Salton Sea is in the United States that makes it such an attractive source of lithium. It’s the way lithium can be extracted. Right now, there are two common ways lithium is mined: open-pit, and evaporation. Open-pit mining is especially common in Australia. Archived audio: It’s vast and remote here in Pilbara and rich in minerals. Tamara Winter: Pilbara: sparsely populated and full of lithium. It’s home to growing mining operations. Archived audio: A new mine has recently opened here with the aim of becoming one of the biggest lithium mines in the world. Tamara Winter: That clip is from 2018. Since then, global demand for lithium has grown. And mining operations have become more and more lucrative. Archived audio: But we do things differently here. Mining hard rock lithium. Tamara Winter: In this type of mining, lithium-rich rocks are blasted apart. Pulverized. And soaked in sulphuric acid. Places like Pilbara are the ideal location for this kind of mining. It’s a region slightly larger than Iraq, but with barely more than 60,000 residents. But the pits still leave deep scars across the land. And acid runoff contaminates water supplies. The other type of mining used to collect lithium is evaporation mining. This practice is most common in South America and involves pumping groundwater from underneath dry lake beds and salt flats into enormous evaporation ponds. For example, the ponds at the Atacama salt flat form a checkerboard that stretches almost 30 square miles. In addition to taking up a lot of land, this type of mining uses large quantities of water in areas where it is already scarce. Indigenous communities near the Atacama salt flats have lost access to water and those opposed to mining fear for the fate of local wildlife if the mining operation continues. Archived audio: Sonya Ramos believes that lithium mining is killing this desert. A growing number of Chilean scientists agree and have come to the Atacama to join her campaign to stop it. Tamara Winter: So, the irony here is clear. Mining lithium—the metal that is crucial to a global transition to clean energy, can create environmental issues of its own. Added to this is another uncomfortable reality: currently the most developed nations in the world have the highest demand for lithium. But it’s sourced from some of the poorest. As Dr. Michael McKibben notes… Michael McKibben: We’re letting all the environmental problems occur in these other countries to satisfy our need for lithium. Tamara Winter: But this is where the Salton Sea comes in. The way that lithium will be gathered from the Imperial Valley is so different from open-pit and evaporation mining that Dr. McKibben hesitates to call it mining at all. Michael McKibben: The thing I worry about most is people understanding direct lithium extraction in the context of how lithium is mined elsewhere in the world. And that’s really our biggest challenge is we shouldn’t call it lithium mining at the Salton Sea—we should call it lithium extraction because it’s not mining in the traditional sense of the word. Tamara Winter: The process called direct lithium extraction involves using some of the green energy infrastructure already at the Salton Sea and repurposing it to collect lithium in addition to creating clean energy. There are already large scale geothermal energy projects at the Salton Sea. Everett and I saw some of them when we visited. Everett Katigbak: Maybe describe we’re seeing, Tammy. Tamara Winter: Okay, well this is a geothermal plant. It’s interesting…everything looks rusted by the way…it’s a lot larger than I thought when we were first driving in. You’ve got these giant, round cylinders with scaffolding at the top I guess. Tamara Winter: They draw hot saline brine, rich in metals and minerals, to the surface. As the brine is brought up, the change in pressure causes it to boil. The steam from the brine turns turbines creating electricity. Usually the brine and the recondensed steam are pumped back into the ground so the process can begin again. Direct lithium extraction basically places a filter on this process. Using other elements to draw the lithium out of the brine after it has already been brought to the surface. Then the brine, minus some lithium, is pumped back into the ground. Geothermal electricity is created. Lithium is extracted. And the only remnants are the brine and water. The potential for geothermal energy and lithium extraction at Salton Sea is especially promising because of California’s green energy goals. Michael McKibben: So California is now legislatively mandated to have its electrical grid be based on all renewables by 2045. And so that means we need more geothermal energy to satisfy that requirement and we need more lithium storage batteries to store electricity. Tamara Winter: This new commitment to renewables means that California is ready to invest in more geothermal energy. The state—famously situated on a fault line—has huge geothermal potential. But geothermal has long played third fiddle to wind and solar because of the high cost of building power plants. Now, as California works to decarbonize, the growth in demand for geothermal energy could provide an influx of well-paying jobs and political attention to the Imperial Valley. Michael McKibben: The state public utilities commission just asked for 1000 megawatts more of geothermal energy and the only place that can be supplied by really is the Salton Sea geothermal field. So they may have to double or triple the number of geothermal powerplants down there over the next decade to satisfy the demand for renewable energy. Tamara Winter: This could be an avenue to even more green industry. More geothermal plants means more potential for lithium extraction. But extraction is only the first step. Currently almost 80% of lithium ion batteries are made in China. If lithium extraction at the Salton Sea is successful, it is entirely possible that the area will become the ideal location for large scale domestic battery production. All of this potential is politically attractive. Presidents from both parties have championed the idea of “energy independence” for decades. Archived audio: Gerald Ford: Good evening. Last January 15th I went before your senators and representatives in congress with a comprehensive plan to make our country independent of foreign sources of energy by 1985… Archived audio: Ronald Reagan: ...technologies and more independence from foreign oil. Archived audio: George H. W. Bush: ...there is no security for the United States in further dependence on foreign oil. [Cheering] Archived audio Bill Clinton: I have repeatedly called in this campaign for more energy independence for America… Archived audio: George W. Bush: One of the greatest results of using hydrogen power of course will be energy independence for this nation. Archived audio: Barack Obama: We are closer to energy independence than we’ve ever been before… Archived audio: Donald Trump: We have energy independence right now… Archived audio: Joe Biden: …quote “energy independent” which is a phrase that’s thrown around… Tamara Winter: Energy independence. A political catch phrase that is so popular because it can mean, well, almost anything. Does it mean opening up protected lands for oil drilling? Expanding fracking operations? Investing in wind power and solar arrays? Well, depending on who is speaking it could be any of those. Or all of them. But the underlying desire for stable, domestic sources of energy makes a lot of sense. And as the globe transitions to green energy, the benefits of significant domestic production of lithium and lithium batteries will only grow. The question remains: will lithium extraction do what no other industry has accomplished and bring political attention and well-paying jobs to the Imperial Valley? Archived audio: Infrastructure turned this desert into productive farmland, but young people…worry that there’s no political will to help this delicate ecosystem and the families who live here. Tamara Winter: For decades the communities near the Salton Sea have heard government promises of investment. And while there is a lot of hope about what lithium extraction could mean, there is also some understandable suspicion. Archived audio: Person 1: Anecdotally after windy days we see a lot more asthma patients coming in. Person 2: Myself and my family developed asthma while living here. Tamara Winter: Childhood asthma rates are more than twice as high in the area around the Salton Sea than in the rest of California. As the sea continues to shrink… Archived audio: This area used to be water…but now obviously it’s dry here and the shoreline is hundreds of yards in this direction. Tamara Winter: …more and more fine dust particles are exposed. And risk rises. The hope is that, through lithium extraction, not only will the area receive an economic boost, but that efforts to restore the area will also gain attention and urgency. Roy Durantes: For a very long time the state was the number one entity working to restore the Salton Sea and to be honest with you things were going very slow. Tamara Winter: Roy Durantes is a former news producer and the founder of a group called “Saving the Salton Sea.” He’s also the director of the Salton Sea Film Festival, which gives local youth the opportunity to document their experiences of the area. Roy Durantes: I am not an expert. I am just a concerned resident. I know some people who suffer asthma. And one of my very close friends had some asthma seizures. The playa dries, all these contaminants that have been dormant there for practically 100 years could dry up and become airborne could become dust and go into the region and into people’s lungs. Tamara Winter: Durantes worries that the speed of the state’s response does not match the rate at which the environmental disaster is escalating. Roy Durantes: If you look at the playa exposure. This thing, man, is drying. It’s almost like in a race to dry up and we’re in a race to stop it from drying up because we don’t want to turn this into a ghost town. Tamara Winter: But there are still open questions around what lithium extraction will mean for the Imperial Valley. One thing is certain: lithium operations will grow in coming years. Global demand is expected to rise by over 800% in the next decade. So as this new layer of energy infrastructure is being created, it’s important to ask the right questions. At the Salton Sea, an area that has seen economic and political promise come and go, all these questions are playing out in real time. As Dr. McKibben explains… Michael McKibben: So part of the challenge to the geothermal companies and then those of us who are doing research down there is to educate the public about what’s going on and to help them understand that this is not traditional lithium mining that we’re talking about. Tamara Winter: A little bit like the L.A. Times in 1966 envisioning the area as the next Palm Springs, there is a potentially thrilling future in the making at the Salton Sea. One where lithium extraction is a success, battery factories are built, well-paying jobs flood the Imperial Valley like the Colorado River waters, and the environmental crisis at the Sea is contained. That’s a future Roy Durantes can see. Roy Durantes: What’s important is the thousands of families who are here. The thousands of kids, the thousands of people. My hope for the area is that the Salton Sea is restored so that it becomes a place of business. A place of industry. A place of recreation. A place of economy. A lot of us are very expectant and very hopeful. We want to see something happen. We want people to bring in solutions. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press.

To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, our films, and more, visit press.stripe.com That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the second episode of this podcast you heard excerpts from my interview with Audrey Carleton. She is an environmental journalist and multimedia producer who writes for Motherboard, the science and technology arm of VICE. She covers all aspects of the global transition to green energy. In our conversation she discusses the potential for lithium extraction at the Salton Sea. She also draws on her experience covering the oil and natural gas industries to help explain why local environmental and social justice groups have reservations about the lithium operations. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Audrey Carleton. Tamara Winter: So Audrey, why are we talking today? Audrey Carleton: So we’re talking today because a couple of months ago, General Motors, which is America’s car maker, basically, struck up a deal with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to mine for lithium for lithium ion batteries to go in electric vehicles. For context GM made this first-in-the-nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. And you know, they’re really sort of trying to carve themselves out as a leader in the, in the EV space in doing so. And in order to make that happen, they’re gonna need a lot of lithium. So they have staked out this area with Controlled Thermal Resources in Southern California called the Salton Sea which is a really interesting place because it’s this very toxic, very salty lake. It’s, it’s just a interesting place. And there’s a lot of kind of sociopolitical dynamics going on here, but essentially the goal is to mine for lithium using existing geothermal power plants and use that lithium to create EV batteries and achieve this goal of, you know, being all electric by 2035. Tamara Winter: So you recently wrote about Salton Sea. Tell me a little bit about that. Audrey Carleton: So back in July, I wrote this story for Motherboard on the Salton Sea becoming sort of this new quote unquote “lithium valley” through this deal that General Motors has with Controlled Thermal Resources. Tamara Winter: So Audrey, what is the Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: So the Salton Sea is not actually a sea. It is sort of a lake. And it’s kind of an accidental one. It was created in 1905 as kind of like an offshoot of the Colorado River. So essentially the Colorado River spilled out of its irrigation system into this one kind of reservoir in the very southern tip of California near Baja. It’s also kind of near Joshua Tree, if you’re familiar with that area. It sits around 200 feet below sea level. And it doesn’t have an outlet. So there’s, you know, water kind of flows into it from the Colorado River, but it doesn’t flow out of it. So it just kind of sits there and the way that the water level is managed is water kind of evaporates off of it. And that process leaves behind a lot of salt and a lot of minerals. So it’s become, over the years, incredibly salty, I think somewhere around 50% saltier than the Pacific Ocean. So it’s not the most habitable place for animals or people. It’s in the middle of the desert, but you know, it’s, it’s a really kind of interesting, interesting area from a social kind of demographic standpoint. I believe the last numbers I saw on unemployment in the region were around 20%. So pretty high. So, you know, I think we could call this in, in one future day, if, if this does become a real lithium hub I think it will be a place where environmental justice questions are like really at the forefront of who’s involved in the economic boon that this creates, who kind of benefits from it and who is potentially harmed. I think there are a ton, a ton of interesting questions, all kind of hovering around this area. And after I published this story for VICe, I will admit, this is probably the one story that has gotten me the most, the most response, because this is like an extremely hot button controversial issue. Tamara Winter: I want to get back to some of that after we set some context for folks who may not be familiar with things like what lithium even is and why Salton Sea is, is so toxic. So Audrey, what is lithium? Audrey Carleton: Sure. Great question. It is an element, you might remember it from the periodic table and it is a key ingredient in lithium ion batteries. So specifically, it’s extremely conductive. What that means is it has an extra electron on its outer shell and that electron because it just has the one it wants to be moving around and glamming onto other elements and creating bonds and in bouncing around so much, it creates an electrical current. So it’s highly conductive and when it’s shoved into batteries, it makes, you know, a really strong electrical current. It’s also unbelievably flammable. So these lithium battery fires are kind of a growing issue that we’ve also been working on at VICE. It’s, it’s because it’s so conductive, it’s really hard to put out and fires kind of spread in this crazy way because this one electron just wants to glam onto other things and they can be really hard to control. That’s a little bit tangential, but you know, lithium is, it’s been called white gold. It’s kind of this like crucial element in the move towards electric vehicles and the move away from oil and gas because we need batteries in order to create electric vehicles and to create battery storage. Batteries will be the key to holding onto the energy that’s generated from wind and solar. In, you know, in kind of building up that infrastructure. It’s super important. I mean, one of the main kind of counterpoints that people always say about wind and solar is, well not everywhere is windy and the sun is only out for half the day, less than that during wintertime. So how are we going to, you know, generate constant energy storage or have sort of a constant, reliable energy source if these things are not around for, if they’re only around for a short amount of time and the answer is, is batteries you generate electrical current and you store it into a battery and then that’s, you know, used for later, but we need to be creating batteries and mining for minerals or elements like lithium in order to do that. And, you know, lithium’s a crucial one and it’s got a, gotten a lot of attention, but there are other elements that have kind of been that are like essential to battery creation too. Like cobalt. But it’s sort of the big one. Tamara Winter: How is lithium mined typically? Audrey Carleton: Sure. Yeah. So Lithium’s kind of an interesting element. It doesn’t exist in a pure state in the earth. That’s usually glommed on with you know, another element. So it’s often mined in this process called open-pit mining, and thisrefers to the kind of technique for mining. And that’s used also in like coal mining and mining for lots of other things, but specifically with lithium, essentially what happens is a few feet of earth is dredged up. Usually open-pit is used and with open-pit mining, this is usually done with whatever the mineral or element that is being mined is pretty close to the surface of the earth. So you just kind of just dig up some earth. A few feet, few hundred feet. And create an open space, and that will make way for the minerals that you’re looking for. This process is done with coal mining for example, this is the same process that leads to mountaintop removal which is extremely controversial and really environmentally destructive. But with lithium mining, it’s, you don’t quite have to go that deep, it often creates these sort of flats. They kinda look like salt flats. You may have seen, you know, like these aerial images of lithium mines, they’re these kind of vast greenish whiteish kind of, honestly like really beautiful looking mines. And what happens is when that earth is dredged up, it gives way for this sort of salty, muddy briney stuff that then the water is evaporated off of it. And that leaves just the minerals behind. And then those are distilled and lithium is taken from it. And this is done typically, I mean, there’s, this is sort of a new thing for the U.S., but there’s this one region in South America called the lithium triangle in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. And there’s these massive lithium mines there. And that’s sort of the process there is open-pit mining and the one consequence to this, the few consequences to this is that it’s very water intensive, it creates a fair amount of mineral waste. And, you know, the health consequences of being around open-pit mines are sort of unknown. There’s this one lithium mine in Nevada, in this region called Thacker Pass that’s gotten a lot of attention and been very, very controversial because it would sort of require doing this same process and dredging into this one mountain. And you know, I think a lot of concern around this process is valid because we just, you know, it’s relatively new, we just don’t know a ton about it. So we, it’s sort of, it’s sort of like a new frontier, like a new unknown, what, what it’s gonna, you know, what kind of consequences it’s gonna hold for the people who work in this industry and the people who live nearby it. Tamara Winter: And I am gonna jump out of order here, but I’m curious how CTR’s process differs from open-pit mining. Audrey Carleton: Yeah, sure. So, Controlled Thermal Resources has proposed a slightly different process from the typical sort of open-pit mining process. The Salton Sea is already home to a number of geothermal plants so those are power plants that take heat and steam from deep beneath the earth. It’s kind of the same heat and steam that you might see in a geyser, and it’s a renewable resource. I mean, we will always have these stores of heat underneath the earth. And you know, these geothermal mines take this up and generate energy from it and then pump that back into the earth. So it’s renewable. What CTR has proposed is taking brine as a byproduct of these power plants and extracting lithium from it, and then sending that same water back into the earth. So it’s essentially taking a byproduct of an existing energy generation process and taking a mineral out of it and then returning what was already going to be going back underground into the earth. The company has been firm that this process is less water intensive and less wasteful. And generally just kind of better for the environment than open-pit mining and requires a lot less in terms of land use. Because that’s another thing with mining is that it uses a ton of land and you know, like maybe years down the line, we’re seeing this with coal mines, at least in the infrastructure package, there’s sort of a push to reforest old coal mines and that’s possible, but it takes a lot of work. And so that’s one, one other consequence of, of traditional mining is just how much it takes in terms of land. And you know, that is land that takes a lot of work to get it back to the way that it was or if you even can get it back to the way that it was. So, you know, this process kind of takes advantage of existing infrastructure. But that said, I mean, they’re still working out the kinks of what exactly this is gonna look like and, and what they need to build and what they need to create in order for, you know, this, this lithium valley or this, they calling it ‘hell’s kitchen’. This region of California to become a real lithium mining area. They’re still kind of working out what that’s gonna look like in terms of infrastructure. So the land use question is kind of still, it’s still there. Tamara Winter: And I know you touched on this a little bit earlier, but I’m going to ask it again. What companies right now are really interested in mining lithium in Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: So General Motors is kind of the big one that’s staking its claim in this region, but California has created a commission, the Lithium Valley Commission, to kind of oversee the process and turn this area into the home of an industry. I think of it as like a second Silicon Valley, because the names are so similar, but General Motors is kind of paving the way. So they made a first-in-the-nation commitment to phase out all of their gas-powered cars by 2035. And you know, because they’re like the American automaker and you know, they’ve made this, this kind of first commitment to be all EV by that period of time, they are really kind of setting a standard for other automakers. It’s going to say, if this works, it’s going to say to other automakers, look, we can do this, here’s how you can do it as well, we can live in an electric vehicle country, you know, within, within a reasonable amount of time. And it could turn this area into a real hotbed. It could really make this part of California, like an actual lithium valley, you know? So I think it’ll be interesting to see what happens. But we’re still a couple years away from that because the deal, you know, with this one mine is still kind of being figured out. Tamara Winter: Why is it so important to mine more and more lithium? Why is there particularly such interest right now? Audrey Carleton: Yeah. That’s a great question. So lithium is a crucial element in the creation of batteries. And batteries are going to be essential in the transition away from fossil fuels because they hold on to energy that can be, you know, kind of created at any time and they make broadly speaking, they make renewable resources more reliable and more sustainable. Wind and solar are often kind of critiqued as being unreliable resources because the sun only shines for a certain amount of time every day and the wind is not everywhere, not all parts of the world are windy, and the wind doesn’t blow all the time. It doesn’t blow at the same speed. So how can we rely on these resources? Well, the answer is with batteries. By taking that energy and storing it somewhere, we have it to use for later during periods when it’s nighttime or periods, when it’s, there’s not as much of wind as a resource, we have that energy that we can rely on. With electric vehicles specifically, what that means is that each car has a battery and that gets plugged into a charger, but the energy that that charger pulls from the grid can come from any number of resources. So it’s kind of a mix right now. It could come from oil and gas. It could come from renewables, but the goal is to transition the entire energy grid to renewables and be able to pull energy from that and store it in cars with batteries. Batteries are essential for everything for the broader kind of transition to renewables. They’re essential for cars because they eliminate the likelihood that you’re using fossil fuels to power your car, because the energy that you’re pulling and storing in that battery could come from any number of things. As long as it’s energy, it can be stored in a battery, essentially. It’s just electrical current. Tamara Winter: Are there environmental risks to lithium mining? Audrey Carleton: I mean the main things are the land questions, the land use questions and also the water that’s required. And the waste. So those are the three big ones is that it’s this process that just requires a lot of water to generate, you know, to pull minerals out of these briney kind of flats. And it, you know, requires a ton of land. A lot of land has to be staked out to create these mines. And in, you know, like Thacker Pass that’s land that’s on the top of a mountain. It’s also land that is on and near Indigenous communities. So that’s very, you know, valuable, culturally valuable and really, really important land. It’s the water, it’s the land and it’s the waste. There’s a lot of mineral waste that’s generated in this process as well. So, you know, CTR, Controlled Thermal Resources aims to kind of cut those out of the process by just using a byproduct of existing infrastructure. But it’s also kind of a new technology that they have created. Tamara Winter: And who lives in and around Salton Sea? Audrey Carleton: The community around the Salton Sea is fairly low income. Historically on average, there are a lot of Latino communities in that region. And this would be, if this goes well, and the jobs were given to people in this community, it would be a real boon. I think from what I gauged when I was reporting on this story there is a fair amount of distrust because there were some solar projects that went up in the region a few years ago that did not end up having the jobs go to the community. That’s sort of historically how these things go. I mean, solar’s a little bit different and renewables we’re still kind of learning, but with oil and gas projects, often what happens is, you know, a pipeline will go up or oil wells will go up, or drill rigs. And the people who work on those rigs are often not people from the community. They are people who work for the company and travel around and go from region to region. And so that’s how you sort of hear about these like abandoned or these sort of ghost oil towns in, you know, in the Permian Basin in Texas is, the industry will kind of move into a region. It will be a huge boon that helps all sectors of life. I mean, the value of everything goes up when there’s a resource like this that’s so valuable and, and becomes such a part of the economy. Everything from like haircuts to like how much your coffee costs, everybody’s just making more money for that short amount of time. But then once that resource dries up, those workers move away, they go onto a new place. That’s also how you hear about these, these sort of man camps of workers who kind of move into this region and work for a period of time and then move to the next one with their company. That’s sort of the trajectory that we’ve seen with fossil fuels. I think there’s still a lot that we’re seeing around the construction of all renewable infrastructure, including mines for elements like lithium. But I think the number one concern that anybody has when something like this pops up in their region is who’s going to be benefiting from it. And if this doesn’t become something that could lift up the community around the Salton Sea and flow cash into it and really become an economic boon for that region and the people that have lived there for decades then it’s kind of like, who’s it for? What are the consequences, what are the trade offs, what’s being sacrificed in order to make this happen? And, you know, if this mining typically is not great, I mean, mining is like kind of a dangerous, dangerous process. Coal mining we have seen comes with like countless health consequences and lithium mining is still kind of being studied, but you know, if there are harms and those harms are kind of inflicted on the people who live in that region, but at the same time, they’re not really given, you know, the local jobs then that’s like a really unfortunate trade off. That’s a really, really unfortunate situation. And it would be kind of an injustice for that to happen. Fortunately, it’s looking like that’s not going to be the process, but I think that is the fear. And so, you know, the folks that I talked to when I was reporting this story out said that people in the community hadn’t really been informed of the mines going up, but were open to being part of that. If it was something that was, that proved to be kind of a financial boon for the region. But you know, they just kind of want to have a stake in the process. And that’s why this Lithium Valley Commission is so important. It’s kind of a multi-stakeholder body. It’s got you know, folks from the company. It’s got folks from the local government in Imperial County in California. It’s got a couple of members from like local community development organizations and nonprofits on it. So it really does have a lot of different voices at the table. And you know, I think if this mine comes also with something like training programs for folks who live in the region and you know, kind of job development programs, then we could see this be something that really does benefit the whole community. But you know, that’s, I think the nuances of that are still are still being worked out. And the one government official who I spoke to in Imperial County when I was reporting this story out, said that so far, you know, I asked him like, does it seem like, you know, the voices of people who live in this region are really gonna be heard, like who has more say, you know, on this, on this panel. And he was like, well, everybody’s getting along for now, so… which is good looking out in the future, but we’ll see. I mean, there’s just any number of directions this could go. Tamara Winter: Wow. Audrey Carleton: I think a lot about the term like ‘sacrifice zone’ which is one that’s commonly used to talk about oil and gas projects. And even in Brooklyn, there was this pipeline that went up, has gone up over the last couple of years. And that term was kind of used a lot, was like you know, this region is a ‘sacrifice zone’ for this infrastructure. With pipelines it’s a little bit different because it’s kind of like, you know this infrastructure just runs through your area, but it doesn’t really create any jobs other than the jobs that are required to build it in the first place. But then once it’s built, it’s kind of built. With a mine it’s a little different because I think you know there’s a more steady kind of flow of work involved in that process. But yeah, I mean, nothing is really guaranteed and we see this all the time with fossil fuel projects where, you know, there’s been some semblance of input from a local community that for example, like really needs funding for education or really needs funding for a certain, you know, social good. And so when they get the chance to kind of tap into something like, you know, some sort of resource that’s really, really lucrative then they’ll often, you know, leaders will ultimately decide to say yes to it, but it’s a trade off. Because it does come with health consequences and then often that, that doesn’t end up panning out the jobs.There’s no commitments or no contracts that say the jobs have to go to people who live in that region. So these are kind of promises that are often made in the first kind of planning stages of a project, but aren’t ever really kept. That’s not to say that’s always what happens, but it is a very distinct possibility with any project that you know, it’s not that this trade off ends up being like the people who live here and have lived here forever, and for whom this is really their home and their community, they don’t get any of the benefits of this. In fact, they just get an influx of people from outside who come and that can lead to all kinds of things. It can lead to displacement/ I mean if we compare this to the Silicon Valley and look at the displacement that happened in Northern California as a result of that. You know, that’s a distinct possibility here. But mostly, I mean, when I think about these things, I think about the health impacts cause there’s pretty much no form of resource extraction that comes without any kind of health consequence for the people who live near it, whether that’s like air pollution in particulate matter and asthma or you know, ingesting like runoff and toxins that have leached into your waterways. Like all of these things come with consequences. And so if it were to be that the community and the Salton Sea only kind of gets those negative consequences and none of the benefits, none of the economic benefits that they’re saying, you know, they’re expressing interest in, that they’re saying that they want, then, that would be like a huge injustice. But I mean, if I’m being frank, I think it’s one that like a company like General Motors would be able to get away with because oil and gas companies have been doing this kind of thing for years. And there’s only recent attention to environmental justice as a concept. But you know, there’s nothing that would, I don’t know, I guess I’m just cynical. I think that the company would probably be able to get away with it. Tamara Winter: I don’t know if I totally disagree, you know, I hope that people will keep writing about it and talking about it. And I do wonder if the tide is turning a little bit. But yeah, I don’t, I don’t know if we have like full, like a hundred percent reason to be optimistic. I know, I’m going to wind get this down and basically just ask you one, is there anything that I, that you think is really important that I, or listeners of the podcast should know that we haven’t talked about? Audrey Carleton: I feel like we’ve covered a lot of stuff. We’ve covered a fair amount of ground. I would say, I just think this is going to be a new, massive frontier in kind of the energy transition. There are probably going to be mines popping up all over the place and other mines. I mean, this one is not as controversial, but the Thacker Pass Mine in Nevada has become like wildly controversial and sort of represents this new intense kind of question of like, what are we willing to sacrifice in order to get to a renewable economy and whether we can kind of maintain the scale of consumption that we’re at and still, you know, avert the climate crisis. Like I think that this question around lithium is so interesting from an environmental perspective, but also weirdly like a philosophical one because you know, we have certain needs that we, as a species have gotten used to having like heat and electricity and cars and the ability to travel and the ability to shop and go places and mail people things. And if we want to maintain that, we’re gonna need an energy source, but no energy source comes without consequences. So it’s kind of just about minimizing those things. And I think this is a really interesting time to be looking at this right now because it’s so new, but I think that we are only going to continue to see more mines and more protests and more lawsuits against companies that are aiming to mine. And I also really staunchly believe that if we want to see a just transition, that means that we cannot treat people and the earth in the way that the fossil fuel and the coal industry has treated people and the earth. And, you know, those processes of permitting plants and permitting drill rigs and stuff and oil wells historically have been rife with violations and like, you know, like bad things happen in oil fields every day. There is illegal dumping all the time, you know, like this is a really, really difficult space to regulate. And I think if we want, you know, our new renewable economy to not come with some of those negative things, we need to hold these companies that are leading it to account. And so I think this is gonna be just like a really interesting sign of where we’re at in terms of that to see, how the creation of these minds play, plays out. And I think it’s like a really interesting, the Lithium Valley Commission and this one community and, you know, the kind of dynamics, the political dynamics at play here are really kind of interesting litmus test of that. Tamara Winter: Absolutely. Audrey, thank you so much for this. I learned a ton. I read your article, which is fantastic, but I learned a ton in just talking with you. So I’m so grateful that you took time to chat with me. I really appreciate it. Audrey Carleton: Yeah. Thank you so much. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Our associate producer and editor was Astrid Landon. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. Original music for this episode was composed by Auribus. To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, our films, and a whole lot more, visit press.stripe.com. Alright, that’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Tamara Winter: The global supply chain is like an industrial ballet. An intricately choreographed dance of manufacturers, distributors, and transportation infrastructure that physically moves materials and products across the globe. However just like a ballet, when one dancer stumbles - the whole production can go sideways very quickly. Archived audio: This is what the traffic bottleneck looks like at the ports of LA and Long Beach. Tamara Winter: In the fall of 2021, with holidays fast approaching, a record number of ships sat waiting just off of the Port of Long Beach, California, unable to unload billions worth of cargo. Fifty miles north in Malibu, the pristine coastline looked more like the area’s notoriously congested freeways. Cargo ships also stretched south, some 100 miles or so towards San Diego, not too far from the border of Mexico. Archived audio: The backup is mostly due to a surge in imports because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tamara Winter: Online sales increased more than 30% since the beginning of the pandemic, and continued to rise throughout 2021. Local lockdowns, and physical constraints on workforces, compounded the problem until, in the lead up to the holidays, it reached a breaking point. Archived audio: The complex delays at the nation’s busiest ports, accounting for 40% of the country’s container traffic, affects consumers from coast to coast. Tamara Winter: One person monitoring the situation closely was Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a technology platform for global logistics. When he heard the news stories about the backlogs at California ports, he took action. He hired a boat, toured the ports, and then he took to Twitter. In 30 tweets he laid out his five-point plan to ease the bottleneck. Soon he was on the phone with California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia was implementing some of his recommendations. So how does someone end up writing what came to be known as “the tweetstorm that saved Christmas”? Welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press all about big ideas in infrastructure. I’m your host Tamara Winter and today we are sitting down with Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen to understand how he thinks about trade, the way he understands the intersection of government and technology, and why he founded Flexport in the first place. We cover a lot of ground talking about everything from ancient trade routes to what Flexport is doing to help during the present crisis in Ukraine. I hope you enjoy this conversation with Ryan Petersen. Tamara Winter: This is a really long time coming. I almost feel like the hipsters, like I knew you before, my dad was reading like cover stories about you. People now know you for donating lots of money to Ukraine or saving Christmas, but some of us, some of us have been here before that. Maybe we’ll start with what is Flexport? Ryan Petersen: Well, Flexport is a technology platform for global logistics. We make it possible for companies of any size to ship anything anywhere. And simply that process try to bring kind of utility grade infrastructure to an industry that’s kind of taped together by duct tape and emailed Excel files and PDF attachments and stuff. And we can make this seamless, our mission is to make global trade easy for everyone, but we want to make trade so easy there will be more trade as a result of when we’re finished. 20 years ago, I ran a small business buying products and China and selling them on the internet and was very frustrated by my experience, dealing with logistics and felt just like…George Bernard Shaw says every profession is a conspiracy against the laity. And it felt like that, like anytime I dealt with these companies, it just seemed like there was, nobody could tell me where my stuff was, how much it was gonna cost, whatever they told me, ended up costing more, a lot of really confusing paperwork, regulations, documents that were needed, data that needed to be collected and shared with the governments and stuff. And it just, nobody was there to hold my hand and make this easy for me. And it’s an industry full of code words, acronyms and Viking English, weird language is used all the time. And kind of like an all boys club, literally an all boys club, there’s lot of men working in this industry. And like, it’s very hard to parse as an outsider. When you’d ask someone to explain it to you—my working model now that I’ve kind of been on the other side is that I think that the industry treats these words, these acronyms, this lingo, as kind of a rookie detector. And it’s kind of icky. Like I want to work with companies that just want help people. And it should be a really fun industry. You get to help entrepreneurs, you get to help businesses achieve their goals, right? But it’s so important. Like we probably lifted a billion people outta poverty in the last 50 years through free market economics and adoption of global, free trading type policies around the world. And yeah, it’s like, here’s something that’s really important, interesting in my view, fun and really broken. It’s like, it’s a good heat map for where you should go work and what you could, what, where you could like build a career and do something interesting. Tamara Winter: In a word, the thing that you’re fixing is transaction costs, it’s funny. I was born in Nigeria and every time I go back, my mom’s like, “Look, if we’re at the market, don’t say anything”, because as soon as I do, it’s like, you sound like an NPR host, I’m immediately gonna charge you, you know, 40% more or whatever. Ryan Petersen: This is when you go back now? Tamara Winter: Yeah, exactly. Right. Ryan Petersen: How old were you when you left Nigeria? Tamara Winter: Two months. I just want to get into, you know, you live and breathe logistics so much so that, tell me about your daughter’s Halloween costume last year. Ryan Petersen: Well, my wife gets all my credit for this. We dressed my daughter, she made a wagon into a container ship, like a little radio flyer wagon, and made it into the Evergiven container ship. And we dressed my daughter like a sailor and had her drive, you know, ride around and pulled her around in that thing. And we even at some point blocked traffic with it. Tamara Winter: [laughs] But I’m sure nobody minded because it’s like this beautiful little girl just being driven around. Ryan Petersen: It was super fun. Tamara Winter: Tell me about, so we talked about, why you started, how you got to starting Flexport, but I wanna go back even earlier. What was your upbringing like? How does somebody raise a child that goes on to, you know, I don’t know, save Christmas? Ryan Petersen: [laughs] Saving Christmas. So my mom is an entrepreneur actually. And she’s an expert on food safety and like regulations, the intersection of food safety and government regulations. So helping companies to comply with food safety regs and, and build healthier food supply chains. I do kind of think she raised my brother and I to be entrepreneurs. We used to get our allowance by delivering sodas to her office. And like we had to sell them, we would buy the sodas at Safeway or something, sell them to her office and make, you know, make a spread. Tamara Winter: [laughs] And then that was your allowance? Ryan Petersen: Yeah, that was how we got allowance. It was good money. She allowed us to overcharge her for the sodas. We’d go to Costco and buy, blow pops in bulk. And I’d sell them to all the other kids in my middle school. I don’t think at the time I was thinking about entrepreneurship, obviously, she never talked to me about that, but both my brother and I became entrepreneurs. Tamara Winter: It’s interesting how many parallels there are to different parts of the series, but the very first episode with Mwiya who is building a city in Zambia, his father was like one of the chief architects of Zambia’s finance ecosystem, but his mother was an entrepreneur. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, my mom’s a huge influence on me. My brother’s probably even more so. My brother’s a born entrepreneur too. And, when I graduated from college, I didn’t have a lot of prospects for gainful employment. Tamara Winter: Why? Ryan Petersen: I don’t know, I went to UC Berkeley. I was really interested in international development. The question of like, why are some countries poor and some countries rich? Tamara Winter: You didn’t want to become an economist? Ryan Petersen: I didn’t have the skillset for that. And then no, I didn’t wanna do like a PhD in economics. Honestly, I’m very skeptical of it all. So my brother hired me working for this trading company. Tamara Winter: Is he older or younger? Ryan Petersen: My older brother, yeah. And he was a computer programmer at Intel and he was taking his salary and using it to buy stuff in China and sell it on the internet. Just like very entrepreneurial. This is, late nineties, early 2000. So there was a tech startup scene, but we weren’t part of that. It was like just a couple kids trying to make some money. Tamara Winter: And are you from Berkeley? Ryan Petersen: Bethesda, Maryland. Washington DC. Tamara Winter: So this is interesting because you are sort of like right in the heart of government. And you’re in Bethesda. And for anyone who’s listening, who doesn’t know about Bethesda, Bethesda is where sort of the children of bureaucrats grow up. Ryan Petersen: Well, my dad worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. My dad’s a computer programmer actually, wrote his first code that was like in production, in use in the seventies when he was working, it was actually evaluating Soviet defense. Eventually my mom started this business that does food safety and she needed software to evaluate risk of pesticides and applying like, okay, if we use this pesticide, what will happen based on the dietary data of the whole United States population? What’s the safety implications of various pesticides? And so he wrote that software. And that’s still the software that the U.S. government uses to evaluate pesticide risk assessment in the United States, is written by my father. Tamara Winter: So in some ways the marriage of government and technology or commerce is just like a very natural one for you. I’m curious about your philosophical influences. I mean, I’m hearing some like Hayek in what you’re saying. I was looking at some of the books that you recommended and I mean, they’re everywhere from The Goal to just like interesting philosophical read. So tell me, who are the sort of intellectual influences on how you think? Ryan Petersen: The thing I love about reading is like, if, if you’re reading good books, every good book you read should point you to like two or three more. I don’t think I ever really read a book by the way, cover to cover on my own until I was about 25 years old. I’m serious. I like hacked my way through college and like, you know, found the Cliff Notes or whatever. When I was 25, I was living in China and running this sort of business that would export products from China, studying Chinese in the morning and exporting products to sell in the United States. I was living there and all of a sudden books became incredibly scarce and I was kind of bored. I didn’t have that many friends. And so when, you know, there’s not a lot of English bookstores at that time. In the part of China I was living. So I would go to Hong Kong and buy like a backpack full of books and bring ’em back. And so that’s when I really became a reader. I think I read over, over like 75 books in one year that year. And it’s become a real passion of mine. The biggest influences, I think that the aha moments where I was like, whoa, this changed my worldview, probably like Richard Dawkins and reading The Selfish Gene and understanding something about evolution and genetics. And then building from that is a book that really changed my worldview is called Complexity, Waldrop is the guy’s name. And it’s about complex adaptive systems. And this idea of feedback thresholds of complexity, when a system has enough interacting parts that at some point there’s this threshold of complexity it reaches, and it has emergent properties and it changes. So take hydrogen and oxygen. It’s pretty simple, but if you put them together, at some point you get enough of these molecules together and you got the emergent property of wetness of water, but there’s nothing about hydrogen or oxygen that if you looked at them, you would say, oh, this will—there’s wetness here. Like, no, it happens at some level of complexity when you put enough of these together. And so that was the first book that set me on that. And the one that I found that I really recommend to people, it’s not a book, it’s an Audible course called Big History. And it’s the application of complexity theory to the history of the world starting at the Big Bang all the way to the present. And then when you start to see that you can apply that in business is when it gets really fun. And that many, you know, it’s many of these things are just fascinating to watch, be able to apply an idea from one discipline to another. I think that’s where you get the most innovation is taking an idea from biology and applying it to business. Society tends to create specialists. And I really like being a generalist, understanding a little bit about everything and then you get creativity because you’re putting ideas from different disciplines that no one ever thought to combine. And my most recent inspiration has been a guy named John Boyd who’s a military strategist and talks about, how do you manage volatility and chaos, which is something that the military has to be really good at. And what is, what are the attributes of an organization that in the middle of complete chaos fog of war, what’s going on here can still take decisive action and not be caught like in survival mode and fail. And I think that’s something I’ve been trying to apply a lot at Flexport because we’re in a lot of chaos all the time. And if we can make sure we’re still playing offense, like understanding what’s happening around us and taking decisive action and then learning based on our actions. Tamara Winter: Okay. Tell me about trade routes. Maybe you can paint a picture for me sort of about the evolution of modern logistics. Ryan Petersen: Oh wow. Oh, well trade is something there’s, there’s evidence of long distance trade between human beings that far predates even things like art. Tamara Winter: Yeah. Ryan Petersen: Possibly predates language like 10, 50,000 or more years ago, you can, you can find evidence that humans were transporting things over a long distance. It goes for a really long time, even like the invention of the boat. The invention of the boat happened in like Mesopotamia, where what they were actually doing is transporting goods down river. And what they would do is build these wooden boats, cover them with animal skins so they could float down river and then scrap the boat, but keep the animal skins and hike back and do that over and over again. That was tens of thousands of years ago, like before agriculture, even. So this is an ancient, really ancient industry. I think you could probably date the more modern form with the age of exploration and sort of like Prince Henry, the navigator in Portugal. And actually you really wanna tie that to the Mongol invasions. So the Islamic empire kind of separated Europe from the east and they traded a lot, but the Islamic empires were in between and they were the middle man and they marked everything up like 10x and made a lot of money became rich doing that. And during the Mongol invasion, the Mongols came and defeated the caliphate in Baghdad and opened it up. And that’s where you get like Marco Polo, right, traveling to the east and kind of saw the riches of Asia and Europe for the first time was trading. And that was about a hundred year window when it was open. And then it came kind of crashing back down. The iron curtain of the Islamic empire came back and Europe was like, wait a minute. We, like, we just saw, all those riches we wanna get in on these like cheap spices and all the other stuff, the silks and everything. And so it started with the Portuguese trying to find a way around Africa and they started, this is like the original kind of like technology industry. They had to build all kinds of astronomic instruments to be able to tell where you are. It was about, I want to say 1350 is when they really started that program. And 1498 is when they rounded the horn of Africa and made it into India. Now, it’s not all beautiful. Like obviously there’s terrible things that happen. Like the first thing they did was kill a whole bunch of people who were on their way to the Hajj Islamic pilgrimage. It’s easy to kind of see yourself in these people. Especially as like a European descent person like myself, I’m like, oh yeah, I came from these people, but they were like really superstitious, very different types of people. They saw themselves in a holy war against Islam it was really, like reverse jihad crusade from the beginning. But very quickly they set up trading centers and the spices were like 1/1000th of price or something like that. Maybe, maybe that’s a bit, but it was so much cheaper if you could go to the source and not just in India, but all the way to the Spice Islands, which is, I think, modern day, the Malukus or Indonesia. And so it suddenly became very, very rich. It was kind of the original venture capital that if you sent a ship to the Malukus and it made it back, you made like eight extra money and yeah, only half the people made it back, but you still got four extra money. You know, only half the ships made it back. So that’s kind of the origin. And I think where it really comes to the next level is in the, I want to say like one of the Dutch East India Companies, the first joint stock companies, or the first public company you could buy shares in was a shipping company, the Crown of the Netherlands and later England and France to the certain extent gave monopolies on trade and in exchange for, the crown would take 20%, but then if you wanted a trade with the east, only this one company could trade. And so that was like 1700s, 1800s the East India Company, but there’s terrible things, of course: trading slaves, trading opium was big, we don’t want to pretend like all of the trade was always great and you do need regulations and there’s good reasons to have like all the rules that we have around trade today, but yeah, it’s a fascinating industry and it’s like really cool to be part of that today. Probably the most important thing, I would argue that the most important technology of the last 50 years is the shipping container. At least in terms of like lifting people out of poverty and unifying the world, creating globalization and yet, it hasn’t really changed. We still unload these ships one container at a time. It’s just like, there’s not a lot of innovation and it makes sense because it’s hard to change an organization, an institution, a way of doing things. Tamara Winter: That actually sort of beautifully dovetails into what I wanted to ask you next. You know, most people tend to think of supply chains from a consumer point of view, right? So you know, earlier this week I ordered my favorite version of Clif Bars, this is a peanut butter banana one, and you know, I press some buttons on Amazon and it comes to me. So that’s the typical way people think about supply chains, but can you talk about how the supply chain affects the economy more broadly? Ryan Petersen: Well, it’s the circulatory system for the economy. The supply chain can be a lot of things. It’s also the manufacturing and things, the raw materials, there’s a great paper called I, Pencil. You know what I’m talking about? I, Pencil? Tamara Winter: I love I, Pencil. For anyone who’s not listening, the founder of FEE, the Foundation for Economic Education. It’s a great essay about trade, about how a pencil gets made called I, Pencil. Yeah. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, yeah. And it’s basically the idea that like, there’s no human being that understands how you make a pencil and you couldn’t possibly make something simple as a pencil because you have to understand, okay, what is it made of? It’s got wood. It’s got like maybe rubber, some graphite in the middle and some kind of aluminum rapper. It’s like, okay, to make that, you need to understand how to cut down trees. Okay. How do you cut down a tree? You need a saw, okay, now I need to know metallurgy. It’s like right away, you give up. There’s no one, you know, of course there’s some people who know metallurgy, but now to make rubber, okay. I need to know how to grow rubber trees, do the little thing where they cut the slit in it, you know, capture the rubber, process it. The same for aluminum, same for graphite. And then create, I have no idea how they put the graphite inside the wood, but they have to do that too. It’s like, there’s no one who could do all of that. And then imagine that on an insane complexity of the modern economy, where everything is connected to everything else, and we all take it for granted. And that fundamentally it’s the supply chain. How does this connect to one another? How do we connect companies, people and the ideas that go into those products, right? Adam Smith has a great quote, he’s like, “I never saw a dog exchange a bone with another dog.” It’s something that only humans do. And we depend on it to an insane degree. It’s what advances civilization and progress because every time two people trade with one another, there’s a mutually beneficial exchange. And so value is created from that process. I give you something that you value more than what you gave me, I think it’s a foundational aspect of like, how we rise up as a human civilization, as a, human you know, species. I think it’s actually one of the dangerous things in globalization, is you lose kind of some of the uniqueness of different cultures and different civilizations and being uniquely good at something. Probably the most important economist, if not the most famous, is David Ricardo explained how this value creation takes place when two people trade. But if everybody has the same ideas, then all you get is like, oh, we have slightly different geographic attributes, geologic attributes, you have coal and we have timber or something. It’s not, not that interesting when all the ideas are the same. And you lose some of that if there’s cultural monotone, like all the civilizations have the same ideas. It’s not very interesting. I love to travel and I think I used to like to travel even more because the internet has kind of created a lot of monoculture. You can get avocado toast anywhere you want on planet Earth now, it’s like a sign elites are traveling in the neighborhood. I hate seeing avocado toast when I’m in some foreign country. And you know, you want to live in a world where there’s like more cultural diversity and I think it can lead to more interesting exchange of ideas and exchange of products and things. Tamara Winter: There’s a great Verge article that I think about constantly called Welcome to Airspace. And it’s all about the Airbnbification of everything. The last time I was in Zambia, I just tweeted pictures. Like, where do you think I am right now? And I got like, oh, Miami, San Francisco. And I was like, nope, I am in Lusaka, Zambia. And it looks like I’m in Miami. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. I bet you can get avocado toast there. Tamara Winter: You actually can. And you know what? The avocado toast was some of the best avocado toast I’ve ever had, I’m still thinking about that avocado toast. Alright, I’m ready to talk about Flexport. What is the problem that Flexport was created to solve? Ryan Petersen: It’s fundamentally that it’s too hard to buy products in another country and import them into a different country, ship them around the world, clear them through customs, get them delivered, where they need to go. And this is for businesses, like helping a company solve this problem that they shouldn’t honestly have to have this big bureaucratic department pushing paper to do the things, it should be automatic like, companies need to be really good at two things: make an awesome product that’s high quality at scale that people want—very, very hard, almost a nightmare to do that in this world—and then even harder in my view is be differentiated, like build a brand, a customer connection, sell the product. So supply and demand, right? It’s like the core attributes of a business. And if they’re doing all this other stuff like compliance and spending time on paperwork and shipping and routing containers and tracking things like, it’s not really value added work. It should be an automatic kind of utility scale, just reliable thing that’s out there. And that’s what we, that’s what we’re building. Very, very hard problem, because if you wanna ship a single, let’s call it a pallet of goods. Tamara Winter: Yeah, I actually would love you to walk me through, you know, if I’m, if I’m the, you know, the Clif company, what actually does it take to ship this from wherever it was made now I’m kind of scared, to me in, in New York. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and so if you’re, if you’re making well, let’s say—I don’t know enough about Clif Bars, so I don’t wanna speak to, that specific company, but let’s say you’re making a pallet of some new, like cool hardware company, maybe these headphones right here. And you’re trying, they’re probably made in Shenzhen or thereabouts, in Southern China. And if you were to try to get those products made and shipped in a smaller batch, let’s take, because I want to show you it’s very normal to ship like a pallet of stuff. It should be even more normal than it is, except it’s really hard. But let’s say we’re shipping a pallet. So we’re talking about like one meter cubed of stuff that needs to ship around the world and it’s going to be—okay, how many companies are gonna be involved in this transaction? I’m shipping this from, let’s say Shenzhen to St. Louis. Alright, I’ve got a pallet of stuff and it’s going to go by ocean freight to save money—air freight’s pretty expensive. I’ve got the factory that’s gonna pick these up. So I’ve got to send a truck to pick it up, bring it to a warehouse where it’s gonna be consolidated with other customers’ cargo, put into a container. I’ve got to find a container somewhere. I’ve got to then get another truck that takes that container to the port. A customs brokerage needs to clear it out of the port, out of the country. I’m now at seven companies involved in this transaction and I haven’t left the home country yet. Seven different companies. Put it on a ship is eight, clear it through customs on the other side of the world, bring it to the port, 10 companies, another truck picks it up, brings it to a warehouse. That’s 12 companies. Another truck brings it to your final warehouse for wherever it’s destined. I’m not even like in the store yet. Oh. And by the way, there’s a bank that’s providing a payment on this transaction, maybe it’s Stripe. There’s a insurance company that’s going to underwrite in case something gets lost or damaged in the way. So I’ve got like 13, 15 companies, very normal thing to have that. Tamara Winter: And I don’t even have my headphones yet. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Your headphones haven’t got to the consumer, right. And so warehouse pick, pack and delivery. Fundamentally the problems come about because everybody in this chain is operating off of like a very local set of data of what can they see about the transaction. And yet they’re dependent on each other in a chain. Humans have to be involved in some of it. Compliance is at stake. You can’t just ship anything across international borders for good reasons. Counterfeit, drugs, arms, people, who knows what can be shipped, right? So you need these regulations. And so that’s the fundamental problem is how do we get data to the company that needs to do something, connect with that asset, with that truck, with that ship, if there’s an asset involved, show them what to do. They need data to do their job. And then they have to tell us what they’ve done and share data back. And that’s, that’s fundamentally, what’s different. We call this business a freight forwarder. That’s what we call this industry that solves this problem. Because if you’re a startup making headphones, you definitely don’t wanna be dealing with 15 companies every time you ship your pallet of headphones. So you call a freight forwarder and then a freight forwarder deals with the complexity. I often joke it should called freight email forwarding because they basically just like email everybody and make it happen. And you don’t have to deal with that. What Flexport does differently is build interfaces, web interface, mobile interface, increasingly it’s about APIs and connectivity to software talking to software so that, that data can flow to and from these parties and get visibility at what’s happening, control over what’s happening, to help smooth that transaction, make it cheaper, make it faster. Hopefully we can route around disruptions in supply chain. We can find you better routings and cheaper, faster, more options and make that process better. Tamara Winter: You have had an inside look, more so than most, into what part of the supply chain has broken down in the past couple of years, you know, there’s the like sort of evergreen headline in this, in these unprecedented times. What in the supply chain broke down? Can you just help me understand that? Ryan Petersen: A lot of things, I mean, I think fundamentally what’s happened is that consumers really shifted their buying patterns rapidly overnight. When we all locked down and stop going to restaurants, hotels, bars, travel, all these things that are in the, what we call services, massages, like stuff that you just stop doing, tended to be services and we all shifted our spend onto goods. Income didn’t fall that much. A lot of people were out of work, especially if you worked in the services businesses, but the government really printed a lot of money and did a lot of stimulus. So people had money, money burns a hole in your pocket, you’ve got to spend it you know, you’ve got to get your dopamine somewhere. So people just kept buying stuff on Amazon and elsewhere, e-commerce went crazy. So you had this big shift from services onto goods and with all those goods purchases that just put incredible stress on our supply chain, manufacturing companies and couldn’t keep up. And so a lot of things kept breaking down. On logistics, it’s a simpler story. We just didn’t have enough infrastructure, not enough containers, not enough chassis—these are the trailers that haul containers—not enough drivers for the trucks, not enough container ships, the ports that we have didn’t have enough throughput to keep up with all the excess volume. So like volume of containers is up 20% over pre-pandemic levels. Things started to break down just by just not being able to keep up with the demand. Tamara Winter: I’m thinking back to when my poor dad had to sit through me and Swan Lake. I mean, if one thing goes wrong, if the Nutcracker, you know, falls, everybody falls. And, and it sounds like that is kind of a, there’s a similar level of fragility in our supply chain, which I don’t know that most people appreciated, because again, there’s a pencil right here. All you can see is, you know, the pencil that gets to you. And a lot of that complexity is just kind of hidden. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. And markets work like for the most part and the price mechanisms respond. And you gotta be careful what if the price goes way up for ocean freight, which it has, it’s like up five x or so over pre pandemic levels, and there’s a lot of push right now, Congress is trying to bring it back down through regulations. We’ve got more talk about price controls than we’ve had, like in my lifetime right now. And it’s pretty dangerous because that high price is a signal to market participants. Hey, there’s money to be made. If you can bring a ship to market, if you can build a ship and that’s how markets are supposed to function. So you take out the price mechanism and you will not get more goods in response to the demand. And like, what we need is more supply, and that’s what prices are for. So when prices go up, I know a lot of government politicians, or it’s popular to say, oh, corporations are greedy, but like, maybe so, but the mechanism is price is high. Oh, wait, there’s opportunity here. And people surge onto that. And that’s, it’s amazing. It is a ballet like that. It all works. And it works because of the price mechanism basically. But it’s also amazing that it works given how screwed up humans are, like human nature is pretty screwed up. And like the fact that it all works is kind of a miracle. Like people have all, we’re kind of like beasts inside and have all these crazy emotions and terrible things, yet the economy mostly works and it’s, we can call it fragile, but it’s been relatively resilient. Tamara Winter: Tell me about some of the misconceptions that people have about global trade. You’ve become kind of a go-to expert, like what are the sort of things people just get wrong over and over again? Ryan Petersen: The idea that trade is exploitative, I think is a really interesting one. Like you have this whole fair trade movement, which I don’t quite get because trade is like mutually beneficial exchange or the idea that someone’s being exploited here, doesn’t really add up to me. I think you do need really good regulations on like externalities, like environmental damage and there’s great reason to have rules, like to protect environment, and labor safety standards and things like this, child labor and all that. But like, that’s not a trade. That’s just like good governance. The trade aspect of like one company exchanging something for money on the other side of the world, that’s like, that is the heartbeat of wealth creation, value creation, the engine of prosperity. And so to take it away, I’ve found to be really dangerous. That’s like one criticism. I think the valid criticisms that I’m very much like really interested in or the stuff I was getting to earlier on like global monoculture. Like if it’s the same product sold everywhere on planet Earth, the Earth becomes less interesting. And it’s maybe that’s like a privileged white guy thing to say, because like, I want to go to Zambia and experience like Zambian culture and like, show me what Zambia is like and make it different. Whereas Zambian people are like, look, we’re trying to be less poor. Tamara Winter: Yeah. Ryan Petersen: We want to have a life like you have. And who am I to say like, oh, you can’t, I don’t want you to benefit from like Western nice things. I want you to live with the way Zambains always lived in my mind. Tamara Winter: Look, I didn’t wanna say it, but I, you know, I was thinking it, but I’ll tell you what, next time I go back to Nkwashi, I’ll take you with me. You’ve touched on this a lot, but I wanna ask you explicitly, you know, there’s an inverse relationship between trade and poverty. And I’m hoping you can offer some sort of like more examples of this and expand on that point a little bit, because it’s one that I believe really strongly. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and well, we’ve seen it over the last 50 years. I think China’s probably the best place we can point to where we lifted 600 million people or so from below the poverty line, it’s really an economic miracle. But it’s not unique to China. Korea’s a great example. Export led growth in Korea. Dubai is a more modern example where liberalization and opening things up and allowing trade to take place. I think it’s well rounded in economic theory, which I’m skeptical of, but in empirical data, you can just look and see that the countries that trade more, become more prosperous. And it’s a little dangerous in my view, there is nothing that says that all progress is up and to the right, Like we kind of think so, because we feel like we’re in a golden age and the world’s never been richer. And the graph of GDP is just like this amazing exponential curve. Four percent annual growth, but if you do it for 500 years, you get like an insane exponential curve. But that does not have to be the case. And if you look across 10,000 years of human civilization, there are these waves of progress and then collapse. And we’re right now at a crossroads where trade has not been so unpopular in a long time, you’ve got trade wars between China and the United States. You’ve got pretty much both parties in the United States, no longer supporting a free trading agenda. You’ve got war as we speak unfolding in Ukraine, which has made trade and economic sanctions into a weapon. I’m not necessarily arguing you shouldn’t do this, but we should talk about the consequences. Russia and Ukraine combined are number one and number five in grain exports. And Belarus is I think number one in fertilizer exports in potash. Take Africa over the last 40 years, Africa’s made huge amounts of progress at five x the output of food in the continent per capita over the last 40-50 years. But a lot of that’s dependent on fertilizer imports. And so if you suddenly remove all these fertilizer imports and that’s going to be even for the food sufficient nations, all of a sudden they might not be. And a lot of countries take Egypt or many Middle Eastern countries are net food importers and they buy a lot of grain from Russia and Ukraine. And if that’s removed from the market, food insecurity is what leads to civil war, famine, anarchy, right. And we’re on some level, we’re going to find out just how important globalization and trade is because we’ve taken it for granted. We’ve become incredibly dependent on it. And if you suddenly rip that carpet out, it’s almost, it’s a pretty unfair to these countries who were sold a bag like, hey, you’ll be able to get goods from anywhere. It’s very scary. I’m very worried about it. Tamara Winter: It’s really interesting because there are, you know, the first order effects that I think even those, I don’t know that they’re very well understood. But the second order effects I think are really poorly understood. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, and the second order effects, third order effects. I mean, it’s really anyone who thinks they could predict all of this. I have no idea, but very few people predicted, like realized that actually the governments really aren’t nearly as important as the people in the west and in the social media world, just reacting. And then every company feeling like, oh, we can’t do business in Russia anymore. Tamara Winter: Right? Like Coca-Cola. Ryan Petersen: Even if we’re allowed to legally, we just can’t, and backing off. And that probably was not part of the calculus of like, you know, we’re not, McDonald’s is not required to shut down all their stories, but they just did. Tamara Winter: It’s like interesting, you know, 30 years ago or whatever you see, like those incredible images of the first McDonald’s opening post-Iron Curtain falling. And now, you know, McDonald’s is like pulling out. It’s just, it’s really interesting and visceral. You talk often about cargo as capital. What does that mean when you talk about cargo as capital? Ryan Petersen: Well, just inventories is another form of dollars, the money has taken a different form for a period of time. I mean, that’s trade fundamentally is you’ve exchanged dollars for this other thing, which is a form of capital, working capital, inventory. I think many logistics companies and logistics companies that are buying logistics services, brands, the logistics department is not really thinking in these terms. This is classic, like finance teams think about this. Like they see it on the inventory and on the balance sheet, as you know, working capital, inventory is another line item there. But the logistics teams of the world have been trained, just like buy cheap freight as cheap as they can get the service to buy freight. They’re not really doing the math, which is not that sophisticated, but it takes one degree of sophistication more to realize that, hey, you know what, if you can ship that container 30% faster, then that’s 30% less inventory at any given moment sitting on the water, being unproductive, doing nothing useful. And so you should be willing. Now you can do the math. Are you willing to pay a premium for faster freight in order to get that cash back and reinvest it in your business in more interesting ways and put it to work? This is why, that’s one of the reasons why very high value products will ship by air. You don’t want something really, really valuable sitting on the ocean for a month. One, it might get damaged, but no, it’s more, it’s not valuable have a container load of iPhones. I’ve not done the math. Well, we could probably do the math pretty quickly. There would be probably 50,000 iPhones in a container, times a thousand bucks, each 50 million in an iPhone. I made this up. I have no idea, but I’m just doing it in my head, 50 million dollars. There’s better things Apple can do with 50 million bucks, like run some more ads and pay for air freight, which isn’t that expensive given the value of those products. So those will ship by air. There’s some degree of that, but the typical logistics team doesn’t think that way. And at Flexport, we try to get to, hey, can we help you be heroes, help you represent this data to your CFO so they can see the option like, oh, wow. I could, if I ship, if I pay a little bit more to ship it faster, I get the money back and improve my working capital situation. Tamara Winter: I want to talk about containerization, because I’ve asked you very little about that. You know, shipping containers are kind of, the heart of global trade and of the basic unit for measuring global trade. I want to know, is more generally better when it comes to containerization? Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Well I think containers revolutionized trade. We probably reduced the cost of shipping things by like 95 to 99%, depending on the commodity. You see these old photographs, we have some in the Flexport office, like there’s this photographer who worked at the port of Oakland as a longshoreman and was also a photographer. And he took these beautiful pictures right at the dawn of the container era. So they have some containerization, but they also had these guys doing backbreaking work, like hauling sacks on their bag, loading the ships. And the way the ships were loaded was like, literally like tying rope to tie it all down and unbelievably laborious. And it would take a week or more to load a ship, which is not a good use of an asset. Like you’ve got to get this thing moving. It makes money when it sails. So containerization revolutionized the world and made trade possible, made it possible to buy things from around the world and find, you know, allow economic opportunity, jobs to be created and us to have cheap stuff as well. However, there’s been very little progress in that since the seventies when this took place. I don’t think the container itself needs to change form factor. It seems like basically correct. But the process by which they get loaded, unloaded from the ships, seems like there’s a lot of opportunity besides just like, pluck one container at a time off the ship. Like it would be fun to do a design contest where there’s some really creative types. Tamara Winter: Maybe you should. Ryan Petersen: Yeah, conveyor belt, like PEZ dispenser out the front. I don’t know. There’s got to be some better way to do that. Tamara Winter: There’s so much talk right now about the next World’s Fair. Like bringing or World’s Fair, reviving it. I don’t know. I would love to go and see container ships. I was eating at Mission Rock and we were just watching the container ships, just one by one come through and I, it would be really cool to see like a giant robot crane. Ryan Petersen: Well, the thing to watch is, is the crane up or down? Tamara Winter: What does it mean? Ryan Petersen: Well, if it’s up, it’s not working and just watch they’re, they’re not down that often. Tamara Winter: Tell me, speaking of throughput is the health of global trade, is it primarily about throughput? Ryan Petersen: Well from a logistics standpoint, yeah. It’s all about throughput, efficiency costs, you know, transaction costs. How do we lower the transaction costs to reduce the amount of error? Like most actual transaction costs, some of it comes from humans doing work, but I think at least within Flexport, most of the problems come about through bad quality, bad data rework, like having to redo the thing, getting the, when the data’s wrong, it can lead to, you know, a hundred x more cost. Like if you take a customs clearance, if you file with the right data, it might take you a minute to get the data organized correctly, like a minute of human labor and review the documents, we use machine learning to ingest the data off of, if it is a PDF or Excel file or something, but you still need a human to review it and validate it like for compliance reasons. So it might take you a minute. If the data’s wrong, it might take you two weeks of dealing with customs to sort it out and what went wrong. Tamara Winter: I guess I want to know and this might be intuitive to most people, but why is it so important to have uniform standards across countries on things like shipping container dimensions? I didn’t realize that that actually wasn’t standardized until very recently. Ryan Petersen: Yeah. Well, standards are crucially important for, I mean, the container’s an obvious one because if the container’s a different size, then you can’t have a standard size ship, crane, etcetera. If every container’s different, it just leads to chaos. And so that was actually created by the Federal Maritime Commission, which is a U.S. agency, created that standard. And then used that funding mechanism where if you wanted to build a ship, you basically got super cheap capital. As long as you adhered to the standard. You could build another kind of container ship, but why would you do that when like, this is the standard everyone’s using and it’s like free money if you build a ship like that. So that was one way to get a standard. It’s notoriously how hard to get everyone to agree on standards. Tamara Winter: Why? Ryan Petersen: Well, everyone has their own opinions and you have these very boring consortiums, like I’ve never been involved in the, what do you call the web? The, HTML standard setting body that sets CSS and all these things, I would go crazy. I might have an opinion, but I can’t sit through those meetings, which is dangerous because then the standards get set by like the most boring people possible who are willing to sit through such meetings, and actually it’s a very good example is that the, the 40 foot container was not the right standard necessarily. The companies that invented the shipping container where one was using a 24 foot container and one was using a 26 foot container and for their businesses, that was like more optimal for the size and volume of the stuff that they were shipping. And there’s nothing to say that 40 foot is the right amount. In fact, I would argue it’s definitely the wrong standard because for trucks in the United States, domestic trucks, 53 foot is the length of a standard semi truck, which is really silly because we should have 53 foot ocean containers because then on every single shipment you’d have about 30% more cargo per driver per asset move. Tamara Winter: Why is it 40? Ryan Petersen: It was just set that way. Tamara Winter: It was just arbitrary? Ryan Petersen: By the Federal Maritime Commission. I mean, I don’t know, I wasn’t in, in the meetings standard setting body. Tamara Winter: So maybe it’s your fault because you weren’t in the meetings. Ryan Petersen: Or like take the QWERTY keyboard. I mean, it’s notorious like not, it was set to slow you down rather than type fast. So that’s a bad standard, and yet standards are super valuable. If every keyboard was different, you could only use your own computer. I think optimizations are really important here. So for example, all the containers that we ship on average are only 70% full. Like we use, we digitize these packing lists and do the geometry of the cardboard boxes inside and see that they’re only 70% full, there’s 30% extra space right here. Okay, cool. Like you got 30% savings on carbon just by filling the container correctly. That’s not hard. So there are some easy, low hanging fruit, but fundamentally, how do you replace this? And it might be that this is one of the last holdouts where you continue to use fossil fuels, even as we go to electric fleets on cars or nuclear, hopefully nuclear power for the grid. Like you’re probably not gonna get people comfortable. There has been one nuclear power cargo ship in the history of the world, back in the sixties. I don’t think we’re ever going to go back there. Tamara Winter: What happened to it? Ryan Petersen: It got decommissioned. It went for a couple of years. It was like a super fast boat. But it pre-container era. And so when the containers came along, it was retired and I think it was also pre-Chernobyl when people freaked out about nuclear. Tamara Winter: It is so interesting to me, you know, my background, I went from Bethesda to San Francisco too, then to New York. But it was always really interesting to me to observe the way that technologists interact with government. There’s your sort of Stewart Brand style person who is sort of both very interested in government and very interested in technology, but there is, I think a perception that technologists today sort of hate the government and I wonder why it is so important to you and why you have sort of gone out of your way, really to work with governments basically at this point on every level. Ryan Petersen: Well it’s, our business is in clearing goods through U.S. customs. So we, you know, Flexport couldn’t exist until we got a license from the government to be able to do customs clearance and I had to go through FBI background checks, Department of Homeland Security, every customs broker does. So you know, that is our business is complying with government regulations and we don’t have a problem with the government regulations actually. I think there’s good reasons. Of course I can object to certain things. I think tariffs should be lower or have nuance and stuff like that. But like fundamentally governments have every right to control what goods flow into their country and there’s reasons, very good reasons to prevent drugs and certain kinds of weapons and yeah, illicit activity, counterfeits and stuff from crossing border. So the government plays an appropriate role and we’re happy to work with them constructively on that stuff. As a citizen, I am kind of like confused in San Francisco, why the tech community has been so disengaged with the government. I mean, like we have the board of supervisors is our version of the city council here in San Francisco. And it’s like really antagonistic to technology and to business. They just keep passing rules that are like really anti-business, new taxes, things that are just like, oh, they clearly don’t want us here. We should leave. And yet there’s 11 people on that board. I think probably seven of them are really anti-business and four more moderate and reasonably pro-business appreciate that we employ lots of people in the city and, and pay lots of taxes. So there’s seven seats and, you only need a majority or some form of majority, seven elections, each of which is decided by a couple hundred votes, We are home to some of the greatest technology platforms in the world with literally billions of users. Like we’ve managed to sign up a billion users from your website and you can’t get a hundred people to vote in an election. Like what is going on? Why are we so disengaged? I don’t have a good answer for it, I think you’ll probably start to see people wake up take action and like, look it’s, I believe deeply in democracy, but part of the democratic process is people like taking action and getting people getting out to vote. Tamara Winter: And, you know, as you look across whether it’s shipping, Flexport, what are you optimistic about? Ryan Petersen: Well, you know, it’s, you have to stay optimistic about the ability for individuals to make a difference. I found over and over again in life that if you just take some action, it has a quality of its own that, can pick up the phone and call someone and make something happen, send emails, make stuff happen, and the world just kind of responds. Most recently, like we had this concept on our executive team meetings. Tuesday after the war started, we’re like, hey, we should activate flexport.org on Ukrainian relief. Tamara Winter: For people who don’t know what is flexport.org? Ryan Petersen: Oh, that’s the impact arm of Flexport. We do logistics for humanitarian relief, disaster relief. It has two missions, one is carbon measurement and offsetting and mitigation and two is humanitarian relief. So this is our impact arm. Of course the executive team level we thought of, hey, let’s get flexport.org working on this. flexport.org had already been working on it for like three days. They had already lined up nonprofits and aid agencies and would take action. But we, what we said was, hey, let’s help them raise some money. I mean, there’s only so much that Flexport can do as one company to pay for very expensive humanitarian relief operations. So let’s reach out, texted a couple of people. Next thing I know Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis run this like GoFundMe campaign that’s as of this moment has raised 20 million bucks for us and for airbnb.org to house refugees, us to do logistics for refugee sites. It’s like four days, we did that. And not everyone has our brand and our resources and knows how to text Ashton Kutcher or whatever, but like, you can start on a smaller level and just take some action and help somebody. And especially when you try to help someone else is when the world tries to help you, help you help them. But next thing you know, it’s a virtuous cycle and we’ve seen that with flexport.org. In fact, that was part of the reason that we set it up in a way that we can take donations is it allows us to go out and ask people to get involved, like our customers. We get them to donate products. If we can find a product that our customers make that a refugee camp needs, that’s like, what we do is we match them and we pay for the logistics, or we’ll get a donor to pay for the logistics. But like, by getting that sense of community engagement, everybody’s asked to help. People love to help. Like they want give back, they want to find these opportunities. And so I’m so very optimistic of the power of kind of, I might call it naive optimism that like, believing that you can do something, even if it’s tiny and it has a power of its own to inspire other people to do that. We live in a messed up world, but I don’t think it’s more messed up than it’s been in the past. Like there’s always been wars, since the dawn of humanity, go read the books, like there’s been much worse wars as bad as it is to say, because we’ve never had an iPhone to watch this stuff firsthand the way we do right now. But wars have gone on since the dawn of men and that is not going to change because human nature is not going to change. There’s gonna be wars in the future. And yet humans also, I think if you were to go over right now to Poland, you would see people taking care of each other people housing refugees, people looking after families. And so the bright spot of humanity is not going to change either. And there’s a lot to be optimistic about for sure. It’s like kind of crazy to recognize we all do kind of have these superpowers. It takes a long time to compound so that the world’s given me more resources and connectivity and network to get stuff done, but I think we all have that superpower a bit. And the more you use it, the more it compounds, and becomes more powerful. Like I have a couple of friends who are I might call them like obsessive phone users on like the old school, like call people. And these people have superpowers that would, you would not believe. Like the willingness, I don’t have this, but if you had it, the willingness to make 20 to a hundred phone calls per day, if you make a hundred phone calls per day in 10 years, you’ll be a billionaire. I’m certain of it. One of them called me last night. We’re flying all these goods over to Ukraine and he’s trying to get me to fill the planes full of refugees coming back. And I’m like, that’s a great idea. They’re passenger planes. So there’s empty seats. We could do that, but they need visas to come into the United States. He’s like, yeah, you’re right. Okay. And he like patches me through and calls this like world famous venture capitalist while I’m on the line, gets him on the phone, is like, “Hey, can you help us get visas for refugees coming to the country?” He’s like, “I don’t know why you would think that I could help you with that. But like, let me see, I’ll email the government,” and like next thing, you know, like emailing senators and like I have no idea if that’ll happen or not, probably not, but like I’ve seen crazier plans work and it’s just like the willingness, energy to go try stuff, like make it work. And then you keep trying it and it compounds so, a bit like that. With my kind of port tour tweet or, you know, I’ve just been trying stuff like this for a long time and finding out like, oh wow. It can, like, you can actually have a big impact out there if you, if you’re willing to look stupid sometimes and just go for it. Tamara Winter: So that was Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport. I don’t think there’s a lot more to say after that other than maybe we should all be making a few more phone calls? In the meantime, I hope you will join us for the next episode of Beneath the Surface. We’ll be looking at a type of infrastructure that has acutely felt the impacts of COVID-era supply chain disruptions: housing. We’ll travel to London and visit with a Haredi Jewish community that has fought to upzone their houses so they can have room for their large families. Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager extraordinaire. Our associate producer and editor for this episode was Astrid Landon. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. Original music for this episode was composed by Auribus. To learn more about Stripe Press, our books, films, and more visit press.stripe.com. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Ben Southwood: It’s March the 15th. Half past one in the afternoon and I’m standing on a residential street in South Tottenham, which is in Haringey, a borough of North London. Tamara Winter: That’s my colleague, Ben Southwood. He’s out on the streets of London to look at houses. Ben Southwood: So the buildings we have here are two-story terraced Victorian and Edwardian homes. I can see many of them have cornices under their eaves or bay windows, gables… Tamara Winter: And he’s looking at these houses here because many of them are beginning to change. Ben Southwood: This residential street’s not quite like every residential street in the country because in addition to its normal two-story Victorian terraced homes, there are additional extensions that have been put on many of these houses. They have been built directly upwards, completely in keeping with the existing Victorian facade. In fact, I’m standing directly opposite an extension going on right now. Tamara Winter: Victorian houses in the UK were built during the reign of Queen Victoria from 1837 to 1901. People from across the country flocked to London just as the industrial revolution was picking up speed. From 1811 to 1851, the population of Greater London doubled, half of the country’s population called the city home. A lot of new housing was needed and fast. And today, many of these Victorian houses are still in use. But now, London faces a new housing crisis: unaffordable rents, overcrowded conditions, and the dream of home ownership drifting further away from the city’s young people. London isn’t alone here. A similar story is happening around the world in cities large and small. However, on that quiet residential street in South Tottenham, the story behind those extensions offers a lesson for those tackling the global housing crisis. Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. In our previous episode, we looked at supply chains: the movement of materials and products from country to country and a delicate dance that makes up the global economy. Today, we’re looking at a component of infrastructure that by its very nature doesn’t move: housing. The issues around housing are diverse and wide ranging. Whether the locality in question is a small town or global metropolis, every place has its own unique challenges. Still, once you dig a little deeper, you start to see some common threads. In this episode, we’ll explore why housing prices have risen dramatically in so many places and how individual neighborhoods, like South Tottenham in London, can address these challenges. For most of human history, people lived in rural areas. But over the last two centuries, cities around the world have seen explosive growth. The UN estimates that 2007 was the first year that most people lived in urban areas and the urban population is expected to double by 2050. This means that cities are having to adapt in unprecedented ways. How do we deliver food and other goods? How do we move through and between cities? And where are all of these new urban dwellers going to live? Because right now, the increase in population is leading to a housing shortage. The supply of homes in most cities has not kept up with the demand, unless supply means prices naturally go up. Archived audio: Housing prices are continuing to surge across… Archived audio: We’ve seen house prices go up steadily by several thousand… Archived audio: Housing prices in Ireland rising by a hundred euro a day. Archived audio: Housing costs taking a bigger bite out of your paycheck and it doesn’t seem to be any relief in sight. Emily Hamilton: I would say that affordability in US cities is the biggest challenge right now. Tamara Winter: This is Emily Hamilton. She was at the top of my list of people I wanted to talk to for this episode on housing. Emily Hamilton: I’m a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Tamara Winter: She says the most relevant housing challenge across the country and really across the world is affordability. Emily Hamilton: Several decades ago, urban policy makers were much more concerned about having too many residents leaving cities and issues like vacancy and crime were much more relevant than affordability. But today, as cities have become job centers once again and are generally the location where the highest paying jobs in the US are located, it’s become much more of a question of how to make space for everyone who would like to live in cities and be able to access those job markets at prices that are affordable to them. And in many parts of the world, that holds true as well, particularly English speaking parts of the world, like the UK and Canada, are facing very similar affordability challenges to the US. Tamara Winter: I’ll admit that I’m a statistic on this trend as well. Since graduating from college in 2017, I’ve lived in some of the most expensive cities in the US: Washington DC, San Francisco, and now, New York. From 1980 to 2020, housing prices in the New York metropolitan area have gone up 700%, more than double wage growth during that same period. In other words, an apartment that sold for $200,000 in 1980 would’ve sold for $1.4 million in 2020. In San Francisco, house prices went up over 900%, and cities outside the US have seen equally dramatic numbers. Ireland saw prices rise by about 800% driven primarily by Dublin. Prices in Sydney, Australia were up almost 1,500%. And in London, the average home price in 1980 was about 25,000 pounds. In 2020, the average price was about 490,000 pounds, a nearly 2,000% increase. Ben Southwood: Well, the UK, and the UK isn’t alone here, has a shortage of housing around its most successful, big cities. Tamara Winter: That’s my colleague, Ben Southwood, again. He’s currently an editor for the online magazine, Works in Progress, but he’s been studying housing for a long time. Ben Southwood: I worked in housing policy for much of the last five years, including at Create Streets, Policy Exchange, and the Adam Smith Institute. I’m obsessed with housing. In the morning, I wake up thinking, "How are we going to solve the housing problems in the UK today?" And I go to bed in the evening, also, still thinking about how are we going to solve the problems in the UK has with housing. And this shortage of housing has led to massive increases in the price of that housing either to buy or to rent and also big shortages and long waiting lists for government-provided housing. Tamara Winter: Ben is always thinking about unique solutions to the housing crisis. So when he came across a series of interesting building renovations happening in North London, he had to investigate. Ben Southwood: Most of the time in England, when you do upwards extensions on homes, those extensions look very different to the house underneath and often are very ugly. And often, therefore, neighbors oppose them very vociferously. However, this extension, interestingly, was identical to the building underneath. In fact, it looked as if they had cut off the roof, added an identical story, and then plopped the roof back on top again. Tamara Winter: So Ben did what any good researcher would do these days: he took the question to Twitter. Ben Southwood: A councilor from North London, that is someone who had been elected by the local residents to be on the council—council is just the standard form of local government in the UK—replied to our Twitter threads, telling us what happened. Tamara Winter: The councilor revealed that the people of this community had a particular need for these housing extensions because they were Haredi Jews. Archived audio: Two hundred boys and girls waved a greeting to England, land of the free, the advanced guard of the first 5,000 Jewish and non-Aryan child refugees from Germany will be provided with a temporary home here while arrangements are made for them to immigrate. Tamara Winter: Haredi Jews first established themselves in London in the 1920s. However, it was after the second World War that the area really started to take off as Jewish refugees fled the Holocaust. Haredi Jews tend to be stricter in their practice of Orthodox Judaism than their peers. They adhere to kosher diets, go to synagogue several times a day, and send their children to religious schools. They also observe Shabbat on Saturdays, meaning, they don’t drive or use electricity. All of these cultural factors mean that Haredi Jewish people tend to live in tight knit and compact communities. One area they settled in was Stamford Hill. It’s in a borough of Hackney in North London. Today, it is the largest strictly Orthodox Jewish community in all of Europe. Add to that, the large size of Haredi families and the result has been overcrowded housing conditions. So yet another neighborhood in North London sprung up as a hub for the Haredi community, South Tottenham in the borough of Haringey. By one estimate, the number of Haredi families has increased fivefold in the last several decades. That’s where Ben found himself, investigating housing extensions. Ben Southwood: Hi there. I’m standing in South Tottenham, which is a neighborhood in North London looking around a suburban street. I have two-story Victorian homes. It’s quite quiet. I can see a few people walking down every few minutes. I can see lots of people walking around in Orthodox Jewish clothing. And I’m just about to meet my friend, Mark, at his house. Tamara Winter: I talked with Ben after his trip to hear more about what he learned. Ben Southwood: The local community is Haredi Jewish. Most of them are also Hasidic, which means they have particular ways of dressing, and particular religious rights, and so on. And I met with three leaders in the Haredi community in North London: Mark Groskopf, Shmuel Davidson, and Motty Pinter. Mark Groskopf: My name is Mark Groskopf and I’m from the Jewish Tottenham community. Ben Southwood: Mark is a family man with nine children, one of whom has left the house. Shmuel Davidson: I’m Shmuel Davidson. I’m from the Tottenham Jewish association. I’m also a deputy on the board of deputies and being a community activist here in the area, where I’ve lived all my life. And I thrive to build this area. Ben Southwood: Shmuel is a man who’s very much in demand. During our interview, he had to leave to take phone calls about five times constantly responding to community’s desires and needs. Motty Pinter: My name is Motty Pinter. I work for Chinuch UK, which is the representative body for 80 Haredi schools across the country. I also work for Agudas Israel Housing Association. Ben Southwood: Motty is the extremely energetic leader of the Hackney community. Motty Pinter: We liaise with the council and we do a lot of work with the council. So any issues, they’ll come in to try to understand the Jewish community and see what the needs are. Ben Southwood: This community has lots of kids on average. One of the stats said their average number of children was six. Motty Pinter: In Hackney, 8.1% of the population is Haredi. But when you look at the children population, you have 25.9% of the children population in Hackney is Haredi. When you drill that down to two to five-year-olds, you have over 30% of children, which are Haredi now. So what you figure is how many households. Ben Southwood: So all of these families having six children, the houses just weren’t built for them. Most communities, if they get overcrowded, decide to move out to the suburbs where land is cheaper, rather than staying in central London where land is more expensive. However, the Haredi Jewish community were not willing to do this because all of their cultural amenities are in one place. Shmuel Davidson: I can’t just move randomly to another borough where I don’t have a synagogue, I don’t have a kosher shop, I don’t have schools. My daily life is going synagogue. It’s just part of my daily routine. We pray three times a day. Going to the synagogue is just what we do. We can’t just move random everywhere. We don’t have a synagogue. It’s not, we just don’t have a life. My whole life, my whole family life will just be completely not there. Take for example, weekend Shabbat, I don’t use public transport. We have to walk. So I need a synagogue within walking distance. I need kosher food. I can’t just go to the local grocery store and find food there. There’s no kosher food there. I need to be able to go shopping on a daily basis. I need a bakery. I need a kosher bakery. I need a butcher. I need a kosher butcher. I need a school for my children. My children could go to non-Jewish school, however, culturally inappropriate. Yes, they will be educated nationally, the proper way, as education goes, however, the cultural appropriate education, the religious education, they will not get and they won’t feel comfortable there. I won’t feel comfortable. Shmuel Davidson: This is part of my daily life, my daily infrastructure. So we need to be living in an area where we have the community infrastructure, the synagogues, the shops, the schools, everything we need as a community and live our lives. Ben Southwood: So all of these things make it very difficult for the Haredi community to spread out. They need to be near one another and they have a very vibrant cultural life as well, which is another reason why they would like to be near, with one another as well. All of these things meant they weren’t willing to move out. So instead of moving out, the Haredi Jewish community decided, "Well, should we buy more of the houses in the neighborhood and spread out in each direction?" Well, firstly, it’s very expensive. It might cost them 500,000 pounds to buy the next door neighbor’s house. Secondly, that takes houses off the market and that means other people can’t live there. And finally, there just aren’t enough houses to go round. Tamara Winter: The housing challenges the Haredi community face are just one example. Any neighborhood can grow beyond its limits because of high birth rates, increased immigration, or simply because it’s a newly desirable place to live, but the Haredi community represents this perfect storm of housing crisis. They have on average eight people in their families. They need to be within walking distance of certain shops and community services, making it really hard to relocate. And the area where they live is way too expensive to buy any neighboring homes. If they can work their way through a housing crisis, shouldn’t it be doable anywhere? Stuck in the situation where they needed more space, some Haredi families decided to just start modifying their homes. But because of housing regulations in the UK, that’s easier said than done. Ben explains. Ben Southwood: So in the UK, we have something called planning, which is what Americans call zoning. But the difference between planning and zoning is that zoning is usually rules-based, so there are a bunch of rules that say what you can build and where, and then developers have to follow those rules. Planning in the UK is discretion-based, so every individual house, if you want to extend that house by adding a story or putting a different window on it or something like that, you have to apply to the local government and say, "Please, can I do this?" There are almost no developments that you can do without a specific permit with the council, which is the local government, going through the details of that permit, and councils look through every application bit by bit. And so it makes it very uncertain, very costly to pursue development because it’s uncertain whether you’re going to get permission or not. Some of them were building up in the maximum way they were allowed under the current rules or even pushing the rules to the limit. Building ugly box dormers is what they call them: boxes. And neighbors were objecting to these because they were unsightly and they were ruining the original heritage of the Victorian buildings, but they needed the space. So there was this conundrum where they wanted space, but the existing ways of delivering space were insufficient and ugly. Tamara Winter: Here’s Shmuel Davidson. Shmuel Davidson: There was no basic guidelines on what the rights, what the wrongs were. People were trying all sorts of things and it was just causing all sorts of problems for planning, enforcement, and it was just getting nowhere. And it got to the point where the community and the local authority really became heads up together and the whole thing. Ben Southwood: So they petitioned the council and said, "Look, can we build upwards?" Tamara Winter: Mark Groskopf again. Mark Groskopf: And Shmuel and I was going backwards and forwards saying, "Look, let’s come up with a solution." And it was actually after sitting, going backwards and forward, they turned their around and said, "Look, you know what? These actual lofts are ugly. Let’s come up with a new plan." We want a space, they wanted looks. Ben Southwood: Working with the council, the community came up with the idea of extending the buildings upwards in a way that was consistent with their existing style so that the street looked like it had just been originally built as a Victorian three-story street. Basically, you take off the roof, you add in an extra story that looks just like the one underneath and then you put the roof back on. So it just looks like the original building, but stretched upwards. It can get four or five in some cases, six bedrooms added on top. Tamara Winter: And over the years, the community began to make some progress working with the local council. Here’s Motty Pinter. Motty Pinter: They would put forward the most recent update, people would be able to argue over it or say their opinions. They would put things down on the table and say, "These are ideas that the architects have raised." And then people around the room would be able to say, "Yeah, but this won’t work here or it will work here." Tamara Winter: The council in Haringey was surprisingly open to the Haredi community’s ideas, but there was still some opposition. Motty Pinter: We heard different views from different people. Some of those have been extremely challenging. For some people, they see this as something new and they’re concerned how it’s going to look and how it’s going to end up. Shmuel Davidson: In this area, we had actually people, residents who worked silently against it. However, once we came about the design, with the concept, with the idea, working endlessly with the local authority, with both the politicians and the officers, together with community. And with the product we were going to deliver, I think all around, the opponents, very nice, but they saw the benefits just outweighed the opponents a million times. Ben Southwood: It still took years and years of work from the community to get the design code put through and make it so that if they made a planning application to the council, the council was very likely to say, "Yes, as long as it stayed within the rules they had set out in advance." Motty Pinter: I think once this is actually introduced and it’s introduced more widely, I think a lot of those fears won’t be there anymore. I think it’s just people being concerned about what is going to happen, but when it actually happens, they’re going to see a lot of benefit. Shmuel Davidson: When I grew up here, the concept of building extensions, those days was virtually nonexistent. And I see families today who have built like what we’re standing in front of now, which… Ben Southwood: There’s one going on right now as we speak. Shmuel Davidson: Right. I was going to say that it’s going up right now, which has just made a complete life changer, a life changer to the area, a life changer to the families. The design, it just fits into a beautifully Victorian side of the houses. It doesn’t look odd. It doesn’t stand out. The quality gives to the family, to the people. And if you just go around the area, just see the development, which has gone on here, which has been achieved by this magnificent idea, which I think we’re unique for the country, I think. Ben Southwood: Yeah. Shmuel Davidson: And it’s absolutely amazing. I just hope others will just copy us and do that because as there’s a housing crisis generally across everywhere, and we know there’s just no housing. Our achievement was the product which we have, which we see today. And this is a phenomenal product and it’s a product of community coalition, a product of working with the local politicians, a product working with the local offices, a product working with local residents, consultations, perseverance, nonstop, and knowing where your end goal is going to be and really go for it. Never drop out, never give up. Because eventually, if that’s what you want to get achieved, I want to get there, you’ll get there. Tamara Winter: What Mark, Shmuel, Motty and the rest of the Haredi community were able to make happen in South Tottenham is ultimately a success story. And the numbers would suggest that this success should be replicable. Haredi families have, on average, around six children. The birth rate in England and Wales in 2020 was 1.58 children per woman, a much smaller number. So if the Haredi community can create abundant housing with such a high population growth rate, certainly, it could be done across the larger UK population. But remember that it didn’t just magically happen, it took perseverance and patience, and working within the system to make progress. But why can’t the system be more accommodating to encourage more housing in the first place? Why does it take so much effort to build housing, something that London desperately needs? John Myers: What we see if we look at traditional zoning in places like England is that they were never designed to streamline that sort of process. They were never designed to solve those political challenges. I mean, zoning was essentially designed to stop change in many places. Tamara Winter: This is John Myers. He’s working at the forefront of pushing for housing reform in the UK. John Myers: We shouldn’t be surprised that we’re not getting plentiful housing in areas with zoning, because it was never designed to allow the densification that we used to see historically over centuries in cities, and which led to much loved urbanism that you see in historic housing cities in Europe today. Tamara Winter: His work goes back to 2014. John read an article that made him realize just how upside down the housing market truly was. John Myers: It explained that the total market price of housing in the UK was three times more than what it would cost to rebuild all of that housing at today’s prices from scratch. And so that to me was the biggest distortion I’ve ever seen in any market or industry anywhere. It’s just an eye watering shortage. And it tells you that there’s something really wrong there. It means that the reason why housing is so expensive in London is not because there’s some shortage of land or because we have a brick shortage, it’s because you’re simply not allowed to build more even when it would be enormously economically beneficial to do so. And that was just the most broken thing I’ve ever seen. Tamara Winter: John’s organization is called YIMBY Alliance, which stands for: Yes, in My Backyard. It’s a counter to NIMBY or Not in My Backyard. The NIMBY acronym was born from neighborhoods that didn’t want the downsides of new housing near them. Understandably, there are plenty of reasons to not want certain projects in your neighborhood. After all, who wants to live next to a coal power plant or a garbage dump? But when it comes to building housing, the effects are generally felt very locally: things like construction noise and additional traffic. And so the idea behind John’s YIMBY movement is that the collective economic and social benefits of allowing new developments will outweigh any short-term side effects. And John’s proposal is to leave the decision to build denser housing to the people who live on the street, where the housing will actually be built. It’s a proposal he calls ‘street votes.’ John Myers: If somebody turns a single family home on your street into say townhouses or into low rise, apartment blocks, that mainly only affects the other people on your street, especially if effects on parking and other traffic congestion are controlled carefully. So there’s no real reason why, if the broad majority, the overwhelming majority of people on your street, are happy for those sorts of developments to happen to gracefully allow single family homes to be turned into townhouses or even something a bit more ambitious. There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be able to choose to allow that so long as the neighbors on other streets are protected. Tamara Winter: Street votes certainly sounds like a winning scenario for neighborhoods with each individual voter deciding for themselves if they’d like to capture the benefits of new developments. But of course, it’s not always easy for entire neighborhoods to come together. In South Tottenham, for example, the neighbors were opposed to changing the aesthetic of the old homes there. They ultimately found a solution, but surely, looks can’t be the only thing holding back new housing. Is there more behind this resistance to change? Tamara Winter: Thank you. I think we’re good. Yeah? Ronan Lyons: Yep. And my phone has just gone... yeah, no, it’s still working away there. Tamara Winter: Hello! Yes, I’m so excited about this. I got in touch with Ronan Lyons. Ronan Lyons: My name is Ronan Lyons. I’m an associate professor in Economics at Trinity College Dublin. Tamara Winter: Ronan is a bit of a housing guru in Ireland. Ronan Lyons: People in Ireland might also know me because I work on something called the daft reports. Daft is like Zillow or the Right Move in Ireland. It’s like a major property portal. Once a quarter or twice a quarter, one for rental and one for sale, I do housing market analysis. So with the never dull Irish housing market, there’s always something to talk about. Tamara Winter: In Ireland, we see the same story playing out as in so many other countries. Ronan Lyons: In short, we have a situation in Ireland where we have not enough homes getting built for the number of new households that would or should form. I do think Ireland is a good microcosm of a lot of the issues that have arisen in many... especially high income countries over the last 30, 40 years. Tamara Winter: It turns out, the history of these rules are part of the reason it’s so hard to change housing policy. Ronan Lyons: What had happened between the ’40s and the ’70s in the United States is there had been significant attempts to boost the home ownership rate. What it meant was that the typical district that’s voting people in in the US or indeed in a European country, now has a majority of homeowners and their interests may differ from other households. That was kind of a key turning point. Because once people were aware of that, they were able to co-opt all sorts of reasoning, some of it environmental or quality controls or whatever, and use those as fronts for what is effectively preserving the value of the biggest thing on their balance sheet. Tamara Winter: And so when politicians are trying to appeal to voters, anything that will affect the value of their homes can get politically dicey. Ronan Lyons: When they put in land use restrictions, they’re doing so because they get the elected to do so. People who come along, they won’t phrase it like this, "I will preserve the value of your home by limiting the construction of new homes." That is a vote winner, right? Whatever way, you’ve got to indicate that you’ll do that without saying, "And I’m going to price that new households." That’s a vote winner. If you look at Ireland, if you look at lots of European countries, if you look at the US, we have ended up with a system where the incumbents, the people who are there already and secured their housing, have disproportionate power over new housing supply. Tamara Winter: Despite this individual opposition, the benefits of growth and new housing are widespread throughout society. There’s better investment in infrastructure, attracting new businesses, creating more jobs. And of course, keeping house prices affordable. And with John Myers’ street votes plan, he believes that there will be enough people who see through the short-term to the larger upside. And he’s hopeful because he’s seen this localized effort work outside the UK. First, in Israel. John Myers: The most recent example that comes to mind is in Tel Aviv where the government proposed the means for residents to be allowed to decide if they wanted to redevelop their own apartment block, either extend it or to replace it with an entire new block with more apartments in it. That accounted for about 35% of the new homes in Tel Aviv in 2020. It’s an astonishing increase. Tamara Winter: Second, in South Korea in the 1990s. John Myers: The government allowed areas of single story homes to vote collectively if they wanted to give themselves permission to redevelop that whole area. And again, that accounted for the majority, I think, of the new condos built in Seoul for a portion of the 1990s. Tamara Winter: Lastly, a city in my home state: Houston, Texas John Myers: Houston, as you know, doesn’t have zoning in the traditional sense of the term, but it does have what are called minimum lot size requirements. And that says that if you want to build a new home, you have to have a piece of land which is at least a certain size. Those sizes were quite big. And the city of Houston wanted to reduce that size to allow more homes to be built in Houston, to keep Houston affordable for renters. There was a fair amount of political resistance from people living in areas of single family homes with large lot areas. And so in order to overcome that pushback, they decided to allow effectively an opt-out from the change that they were proposing and that let them get that change through, and you see the results in Houston where there’s a lot of new housing being constructed as a result of that. There are a lot of homeowners who are probably better off because their plot can now be used for more housing than it was before. And yet, the people who are most resistant to change have been able to opt out. And so this principle of giving flexibility on a very small level can make it much more politically palatable to engineer change and to get more housing. If you offer families a way to literally change their lives, the way to guarantee housing for their children or their grandchildren, a way to make it much easier to live, and all they have to do is vote for graceful change, which is completely consistent with what we’ve seen in cities over centuries, I have to believe that a small amount of people will do that. And that’s very consistent with what we’ve seen in Tel Aviv. It’s consistent with what happened in Seoul. And it’s also consistent with the fact that most of Houston didn’t opt out of these changes. Tamara Winter: And as John points out, the needle doesn’t have to move that much to see real change. John Myers: We don’t actually need to upzone the entire London or the entire of the Bay Area in order to get vastly amounts, more housing. So in London, if you just took 3, 4, 5% of the lowest density areas, you would engineer a step change. You would more than double the supply of housing in London. Tamara Winter: With all of these examples, John feels optimistic that street votes can gain some real political momentum in the UK. John Myers: We’ve seen quite a fair amount of traction in England with that. We’ve been lucky enough to find an incredible coalition that has supported these sorts of ideas, because it’s ultimately not very controversial. There aren’t really that many people who disagree with the proposition. But if the people on the street want to see more development, they should be allowed to permit it. Motty Pinter: I want to put it on pause for a second? Ben Southwood: That’s okay. But it’s fine to get extra… Motty Pinter: I have a tendency to talk too much. You don’t stop me, then.. Tamara Winter: Finally, back in South Tottenham, Ben wrapped up his interview with Mark, Shmuel, and Motty. By one estimate, the Haredi community has added a thousand extra bedrooms using their method of building extensions. Ben Southwood: Okay. So let’s have a little look around. Tamara Winter: And Mark himself had recently constructed a loft conversion onto his own Victorian house. Mark Groskopf: It was built about six months ago. So I was living in a bedroom, seven kids living in one bedroom, three bunk beds and a mattress on the floor. Ben Southwood: Wow. Mark Groskopf: That’s how the family was living. Tamara Winter: So before Ben left, Mark gave him a tour of the house. Mark Groskopf: You’ve come into the hallway, you’ve got a dining room. So it’s quite a big dining room which we’ll extend it slightly. And then… Ben Southwood: Mark has a very large dining room, presumably to fit his nine children, wife, and self in having dinner at the same time. Mark Groskopf: Let’s go upstairs. Ben Southwood: And we go upstairs and Mark shows me what the house originally looked like. There were two bedrooms and two bathrooms. In one of the bedrooms was the master bedroom and the other bedroom was seven of his children. Mark Groskopf: This is where we had three bunk beds and a mattress on the floor. We got two bunk beds. Ben Southwood: Now, there’s only two children in that original seven-children bedroom. And the other children are all spread across different bedrooms. Mark Groskopf: And we got another floor. Ben Southwood: And he’s added four bedrooms on the top floor. Mark Groskopf: And then you’ve got a front room over here, as you can see how big it is. Ben Southwood: Wow. Imagine. So you were going from that room where there were six of them in there. Mark Groskopf: Yeah. Ben Southwood: And then now, they’ve got a huge two-bedroom. Mark Groskopf: That’s correct. Ben Southwood: He says that this has made a huge difference to his children’s experience of school, to the togetherness, everyone’s getting along better. It really is striking how one-and-a-half extra stories can make such a large difference to how much space there is to go around when there’s seven children’s crammed into one bedroom, it must be much harder to have lots of the things that you want as a child. Mark Groskopf: And then we go up to the next floor. And what I’ve done is in this area over here, where the front of the house goes alone, we call it the apex. We’ve left over there and it’s a center room. We use it as a center room. Ben Southwood: Ah. Mark Groskopf: So you’ve got the toys down over there. Ben Southwood: Yeah. Mark Groskopf: And then the kids go inside over there and relax and enjoy themselves over there. Ben Southwood: Mark’s family looks after kids with special needs from the community. Mark Groskopf: Every weekend, we bring kids in from the other families to give the parents a rest… Ben Southwood: In the low ceiling part, he put in a sensory room with interesting lights and sounds and so on for kids to go in. And apparently, they really like it. Wow. Well, my mother would love to meet you then because she does a lot of work. It’s amazing how much they’ve managed to add how many... they’ve got extra bedrooms. They make all the space, they’ve got extra bathrooms, and this is all just on the existing plot.

Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides, where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to last week’s episode of this podcast, you heard excerpts from my interview with Dr. Ronan Lyons. He’s an associate professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin and the director of Trinity Research and Social Sciences, an interdisciplinary research initiative that brings together scholars from across the university. In our conversation, he offers insights into the complexities of housing broadly and explains why the challenges plaguing housing markets are especially acute in Ireland. So without further ado, here is a lightly edited version of my conversation with Dr. Ronan Lyons. Tamara Winter: Hello. Yes, I’m so excited about this. Okay. So the first thing I’m just going to have you do is introduce yourself and your academic affiliations, if you will. Ronan Lyons: Sure. So my name is Ronan Lyons. I’m an associate professor in economics at Trinity College Dublin, where I’m also the director of a center called Trinity Research and Social Sciences which is like a collection of a few hundred research active social scientists across all disciplines in the social sciences here in Trinity and people in Ireland might also know me because I work on something called the Daft Reports. Daft.ie is like the Zillow or the Rightmove in Ireland. It’s like a major property portal and once a quarter or twice a quarter, once for a rental and one for sale, I do housing market analysis. So with the never dull Irish housing market, there’s always something to talk about. Tamara Winter: So Ronan, well, that’s actually really helpful. I’m curious about your journey into housing. How did that become a topic of interest for you? And I’m also curious, if I may, about your personal housing situation, because you have...it’s three children, is that right? Ronan Lyons: That’s right. Three boys, six and under, so a busy household. So I actually studied as an undergrad at Trinity and I did economics and political science. And afterwards, as many people find themselves, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do and I was in the lucky position that I was offered a scholarship to stay at Trinity. And I did some research in economic history, the history of trade and globalization, which I found really interesting, but then you’re like, "Well, I’ve picked one thing and I fall into one thing, what else do I want to do?" So I worked in policy making for a while. I worked for the National Competitiveness Council in Ireland. So Ireland as a small open economy is really dependent on its ability to trade internationally. So the Competitiveness Council advises the prime minister and the cabinet on where Ireland is doing well or badly. So that gave me a, I suppose, a taste of policy analysis, policy advice, and policy making and how policy happens. And at the same time, a friend of mine had set up daft.ie, the Irish property portal when he was in high school. And after I finished my degree, he came to me and he said, "Could we do a report where we look at the...just the rental sector in Ireland and how it’s performing?" Because there weren’t...it wasn’t the same, I suppose, measurement of housing market conditions at the time. So I accidentally ended up in housing but after working in...I was doing this as a side gig and I was working for the Competitiveness Council and I did a bit of work for IBM as part of their policy consulting. And I was moving around. So I had done research, I’d done policy making, I did private sector, but I realized that actually the thing I really enjoyed was research. So I had gone wandering around, but I came full circle. And in some ways you have to do that, right? You have to go and, or somebody like me has to do that. I need to know what I’m not doing to know that I’ve made the right choice, but in 2009, then I started at Oxford, a doctorate there looking at the Irish housing bubble and crash. And I finished 2013 and I was lucky enough that Trinity was hiring at the time. So I started in the department of economics then and I’ve kept those economic history or long run economic development as one hat and housing is another hat. And I see them as related because when you look at housing and you look at real estate, if you think about the immobility of a home or a building, when you buy it, you’re buying the opportunity associated with the location. And unlike a worker can move and financial capital can move and some workers are more or less mobile, that’s certainly true, but a dwelling isn’t. So the idea of using housing and using land to tell us something about what is good or bad about a location or what people are more or less confident about for me, that’s the heart of why real estate and why housing is really interesting in addition to the very obvious thing that we all need somewhere to live, right? And if...as we’ll presumably get onto, if we don’t have enough places to live, then all sorts of problems arise from that. Tamara Winter: That’s actually exactly the next question. It’s so funny as we’ve done some of these interviews, one of the producers are working with was like, "Tammy, I think you take for granted the idea that people just know what’s going on with housing, what the problem even is, if there is one." So I might actually ask you that question as, and maybe you can both couch it in Ireland, this is very much an issue across the world. What is the basic challenge with housing right now? Whether it’s affordability, not having enough homes, et cetera. Can you explain it to me like I’m five? Ronan Lyons: I’ll do my best. And I do think Ireland is a good microcosm of a lot of the issues that have arisen in many, especially high income countries over the last 30, 40 years. In short, we have a situation in Ireland where we have not enough homes getting built for the number of new households that would or should form. And some of that is population growth. And Ireland is I think, unusual in Europe in that it will have faster population growth this century than last century. And some of that’s the long shadow of, there was a famine in the 1840s and that’s why there’s such a large Irish-American community and there’s also a large Irish community in Britain as well. And that has those deep historical roots, but since the 1980s and 1990s, Ireland has had a successful business model where it’s a gateway to the single European market. And as a result of that, it has had all sorts of growing pains. As in incomes have gone up, population has gone up, Ireland has gone from net emigration to net immigration and all of those are signs of success, but unless you scale up the infrastructure as well, then you will come up with all sorts of congestion challenges. And the timing was fortuitous for things like road infrastructure, the European Union gave Ireland money to help build a motorway network. It didn’t have any highways 30 years ago, but in relation to housing, that’s a much more local issue and like many places, we have for various reasons, many of which are worthy, made it more difficult to build a home. So in addition to the population angle, we also have something that’s common in other countries as well but I think Ireland is particularly acute in this, changing demographics. So if you think of countries on a journey from having households of four or five persons on average to households having one or two persons on average, and some cases, maybe three, but you see, average household size is going from four to two, even with the same population, you need twice as many homes, but the homes are different. And on top of that, if you go from rural to urban in the same a hundred year transition, you are going from larger rural homes to smaller urban homes. And that’s a challenge of location and it’s a challenge of mix, but it’s also a challenge of viability because not everything scales down, you need plumbing, you need a bathroom and a shower and a toilet and a kitchen, regardless of how many people you have in the home. You need some basic infrastructure in there. So providing a home for one person is not a quarter of the cost of providing one home for four people. And I think that’s a big challenge that Ireland has struggled with and I think other countries struggled with as well, it’s perhaps less obvious than the population increase bit but certainly in Ireland’s case, providing urban housing for smaller households is not something the country is good at and it’s even a struggle to get politicians and policy makers to recognize the scale of that need. Tamara Winter: Could you explain basically what happens when the housing stock doesn’t match population growth or immigration? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. So actually part of my doctorate, one of the main chapters was trying to come up with what you might think of as a house price equation. What happens, house prices or housing prices if income goes up, if supply goes up, if credit conditions get tighter or looser, and the credit conditions bit was super important at the time, because Ireland was coming out of a bubble and crash situation. So that was the focus at the time was how much, if nothing else changes and you loosen credit conditions, what happens property prices and sure enough, they go up and tightening them brings them back down again. And a lot of macro credential rules are about trying to level that out, take that channel for amplifying house prices up and down and just really calm it down. So that then leaves you once you at least try and contain those credit conditions, then it leaves you with this battle between supply and fundamental demand rather than credit demand or assets, factors like that. And on the fundamental demand side, you’ve got income per household and you’ve got household size. And those two things in Ireland’s case have been in...household size been going down, right? So you need more households per population or more dwellings per population and incomes have been going up. And this is another tricky bit for policy makers, the richer you get, the more you consume of everything, some things you shift into and some things you shift out of, but you consume on balance more of everything, the richer you get and that includes housing. And going back to that piece of research I did for my thesis, one of the things we were trying to do was take out that bit and say, "Okay, if you hold income constant then you increase supply by 10%, what happens?" And our best estimate was that if you did that exercise, you would lower prices by about 12%. And that’s a fundamental that, again, in many countries, people are questioning, right? Because they see completions going up, more new homes getting built and they see prices of rents going up and they go, "You can’t say to me that if you build more homes, prices will go down because that’s not happening at the moment." And really this gets to the heart of the social science of housing is that that correlation is not about causation, that what’s actually happening here is that homes are getting built because there’s a lot of need. And in Ireland’s case, there’s a need for maybe 40 to 50,000 homes a year and it’s only building 20,000. Now, if you didn’t build those 20,000, rents and sale prices would increase even more. And that’s the tricky bit because it’s very hard to argue with someone who doesn’t, who sees the correlation and doesn’t believe the underlying theory. It’s hard to say to them, "Well, let’s stop building and let’s see how that goes," right? That’s not a viable suggestion because that would make things worse, not better. Tamara Winter: The conversation about housing tends to be so polarized, especially online, but we’re talking about people’s livelihoods, right? I’m Nigerian, my parents immigrated to the US when I was about two months old and thank goodness they found a house in Texas where we grew up but say they had moved to New York, I think the situation would be very different or in Ireland where my grandfather worked for a substantial part of his career. Anyway, I digress. We know that house prices increasing is one of the obvious effects of restricting the supply of housing for whatever reason. But I wonder too, if you could just talk about some of the less well understood effects of restricting the supply of housing. Ronan Lyons: I mean, Ireland’s a good example of...I mean, it’s hidden and people don’t talk about it that much, but I mentioned earlier, Ireland’s really dependent on international investment or at least outwardly focused. Some of it’s indigenous and some of it’s coming from overseas, but it’s about creating economic activity for exports, right? You’re tapping into the European market. But over the last few years, the housing has been so scarce that firms have been holding back on expanding. I mean, think about how wrong that is, right? That you actually could hire an extra 2,000 people and you’re choosing not to, not because you can’t find work for them, but you can’t find housing for them. I’m not saying everywhere suffers from that, but there are, I think lots of places. If you look at New York and Tokyo over the last 50, 60 years, New York and Tokyo are roughly the same size, they have now...since the 60s, they’ve had very different setups in terms of the ability to build new housing. Tokyo is now about twice as big as New York. And people will say, "Well, New York’s big enough already. It doesn’t need to get any bigger," but the point is, and you talk to say the economic geographers, people like Enrico Moretti or whatever, and it’s the geography of where people are productive. And there are certain features about locations that make them productive and that would allow people to choose themselves if they want to move from say one part of the US to another, in order to move into a growing industry. And if housing is stopping that either internally in the US or internationally in the case of Ireland, that’s a real direct cost. I mean, housing is always in everywhere, right? Someone’s shelter, right? It’s their home at nighttime, but housing is seeping into being about livelihoods as well. And whether we are enabling people to have the most fulfilled potential that they can, that if we’re not getting housing, right? That’s for me, one of the...it’s not hidden, but it’s maybe not always highlighted, the cost of not enough housing, but it does seep through everywhere. If you don’t have enough housing... I wow my undergrads with the story that say 20 years ago, I had friends who moved out of their parents’ home in Dublin to rent a property in Dublin while they were in college, because they were just like, "Well, hey, I’m an adult, I’ll go off and I’ll find somewhere to live." That is so far from the possibility now, if you’re a 19 year old student in Dublin, I mean, you just stay at home with your parents. There’s no option. You may even have to commute. If you’re outside Dublin, you may be commuting an hour and a half every way, very early in the morning and very late at night to go to college. And that has a cost too, in terms of all sorts of things that are forgone that I took for granted when I was an undergrad that today’s undergrads can’t do. And I think they’re hidden costs as well in terms of forming people and their opportunities, because those years say between 20 and 25 are so crucial to people who are, say, in the higher education space. They’re so crucial to what happens afterwards. Everything is path dependent. Tamara Winter: Absolutely. I really appreciate that in particular, because I think it’s just poorly understood. Okay. So this is actually not super relevant to the podcast, but I’m personally curious about it. Can you summarize Ireland’s housing bubble and its subsequent crash in 2007? What happened there? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. You will see it given as an example of, well, this is almost like the textbook case of this is what happens when you let markets go wild. And I think that misses a key part of the story. Clearly the global credit gloss in the early 2000s was an important factor, but you have to rewind a little bit. And in the mid, late 1990s policy makers were grappling with this idea that Ireland is growing, Dublin is growing, how are we going to provide new housing? And they came up with this scheme that said, "Let’s regenerate parts of Dublin as Ireland’s biggest city and we’ll allow people to write off construction costs for building new homes." So it started out with this urban renewal thing, and that actually worked quite well. I mean, you had organizations that weren’t particularly familiar with building apartments, they’re used to building houses and then they were building apartments. So there might be other quality issues there that we can come back to. But overall, the goal of getting new housing, where there was long term demand was by and large met and actually rents fell during Ireland’s boom and bubble. So many new rental homes were built that rents were cheaper in 2004, 5, 6 than they were in ’98, ’99, 2000. And that’s fascinating because Irish people forget this because they just remember when the sale prices bit was through the roof. So politicians looked at this and went, "That’s interesting. So if we do this tax relief thing, we get lots of housing. So let’s try it in all the other constituencies where we want to get reelected," right? So they went off and they said, "Rural parts of Ireland, let’s get loads of housing built." And it was a no brainer for a developer because they could...the rental income didn’t have to be from the property they were building somewhere in rural Ireland. It could be from anywhere and it didn’t have to be that year. It could be, at some point over the next number of years. So they could build these properties and either good case scenario, they get someone to live in them, worst case scenario, they don’t, and they still get a lower tax bill and unsurprisingly tens of thousands of homes were built in places where there was no long term need. And at the same time you had this credit bubble, which was pushing up prices in lots of countries, the US, UK, Spain and Ireland was right up there at the fore, incomes were going up, confidence was high, banks were getting into mortgages. We had savings and loans like institutions building societies, but they gave way to the banks and the banks became the main mortgage providers, but they didn’t realize what they were playing with and they were giving people more and more leverage. So you had these two things going on, lots of new homes getting built and prices going up a lot. And then the global gloss stopped. The bubble stopped, the music stopped and then things turned pretty quickly. And the government at the same time decided to end the cost release. They were like, "Hang on, what are we doing here actually? And we should stop these release." So Ireland in around 2007 turned and went from a decade of phenomenal increases in the stock of housing and in prices, and that prices bit that was credit driven, it went the other way and prices fell by about 55% in the space of five years. And that’s like a national average. In some segments, if you’re in one of these places that got lots of extra housing, one of these rural markets, the cost of a smaller home might have fallen by 80%. And even to this day, some of those rural counties that saw the most construction relative to the number of people in those early 2000s years, housing today is still the same cost it was 20 years ago because so much was built. In Dublin, not enough was built even in the bubble years and housing is about a third more expensive now than it was in 2000. It’s certainly, not even 20 years, it went up and down and then up again. But paradoxically for...the narrative in Ireland would be that, "Well supply doesn’t keep prices under control because look what happened in the early 2000s." Paradoxically what happened in the early 2000s, when you take a step back and take out the credit bubble is a stunning endorsement of the idea that more supply makes housing more affordable because if you’re in Leitrim or Longford, which are these rural counties that saw some of the most housing built, housing is really affordable there now compared to Dublin where it’s not. Tamara Winter: And so that’s why in your Works in Progress piece, you talk about the Irish ghost towns that actually aren’t ghost towns or at least weren’t intended to be. It’s so funny because in that answer, you actually answer like the next three questions. Your dissertation at Oxford in it, you detail the various factors that affect home prices in Ireland. Could you share some of those factors? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. What I had in mind here and I guess, I’m slightly different to the standard academic because I had had that experience of seeing how policy makers worked, or at least I’d like to think I’m slightly...everyone does, right? Everyone’s slightly different. But I said, "Okay, there’s a morass of factors that can affect housing prices, but can we distill them down to the three, four, five, six most important ones? And I was lucky that I had a supervisor who sees...I’m in many ways, I’m a product of his way of seeing the world, right? My way of approaching a question like that, I like to think is mine, but really it’s, I’m inheriting a lot of his way of tackling these questions. So you could have 50 factors that drive house prices, but we were trying to come up with this list of the most important, so that we could say to policy makers, "If you’re looking at, if you want to control housing prices, if you want to see what’s going to happen next, these are the most important." And I mentioned household income, right? So if household income goes up or down and that can go up or down for a number of different reasons. One of the reasons household income went up in Ireland, say from the 90s to the 2010s was because more and more women were actively in the labor market. So instead of one income or one and a quarter income, you might have one and a half or two incomes and that will boost household income or unemployment, right? So in aggregate, the higher the unemployment rate, the fewer incomes there are per household, right? On average. So there’s a lot going on in that measure. So household income is one, household size is another. And one of the things that was under the hood at the time, and I’m focusing more on now to try and get the point across to policy makers, is that Ireland going from say a three and a half persons per household to two and three quarters, right? That pushed up prices by between 40 and 50% in the space of three decades or so. And I don’t think that’s appreciated. You’ve the same number of dwellings, but you’ve more and more households even with a similar population. And of course in Ireland’s case population was going up, household size was going down. So there’s an even greater increase in the number of households. And then there’s the supply factor, right? So controlling for all those demand factors, fundamental demand factors, the supply, and there’s the three fundamentals and you’ve got asset factors as well. And one of the asset factors is what’s known in the literature as user cost. So how much does it cost you to hold a property one year to the next? And some of that is they say expected capital gains, right? If you think your property’s going to go up 20% between now and next year, it doesn’t really matter if you have 1% property taxes or your cost of borrowing is 3%, you are going to get...you think you’re going to get this 20% gain. And that was a huge driver of demand. And then the final factor is credit conditions that how much...for a given set of savings, how much is the financial system leveraging you up? And in Ireland, like in many countries, we went from say, 25% deposits in the late 90s to sometimes 5% or 0% deposits in 10 years later. And if you think of that as in and of itself, going from 25% deposit to a 5% deposit, the same savings are going to get stretched at a huge amount more in terms of the mortgage you get given. Now, other factors come in there, but those are the five ones: household income, household size, housing supply, the user cost and credit conditions. And we put numbers beside them and said, "Okay, if you want to think about what drives house prices, an X percent increase in incomes will do this," and so on. Tamara Winter: Was it like multiple regression analysis? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. So in terms of the methods, what we were using were...they’re macro econometric methods. So what you’re trying to do is run regressions where you want to maximize the ability of the data to tell you what’s going on. You don’t want to say, "Well, we’re going to assume people are this risk averse or that," whatever it might be, you want to let the data tell you as much as possible. So it makes sense on a first pass theory level, it makes sense that supply is going to be relevant for the cost of housing and incomes and so on. And you can put them in and see what they tell you. And you can also break it down and say earlier or later which factors are most important. And that was one of the punchlines at the time, which was almost 10 years ago, was that ’95 to 2001 prices increased…house prices increased a lot in Ireland, but it was a mix of lots of different things. As Ireland went from being a declining population country to a rising population, rising income country. ’01 to ’07, it was almost entirely credit conditions, right? Basically nothing else changed. Yes, supply went up, but incomes went up almost one to one to match. So that the...of the, I think it was the 8% increase on average per year in inflation adjusted housing prices, seven and a half percent was coming just from credit conditions. Tamara Winter: A comment and a question. The comment would be, I’ve never heard anybody mention the shrinking of household sizes being a relevant factor in the increasing demand for housing but it seems so obvious when you think about it. So that’s very interesting. The question would be, you mentioned something a few answers ago about the difference between New York and Tokyo, decades ago they had the same population size and now Tokyo is both much larger, but also...I mean, I don’t know how much larger, but also much denser. And I know that that... I know very little about this, but I know that’s related to the differences in how Americans are even extending it, the West tends to treat housing as an investment rather than how Tokyo in Japan tend to treat housing. Could you speak to those differences a little bit? Ronan Lyons: Yeah. And there’s a great author called Bill Fischel who’s written something called Homevoter Hypothesis and more recently had a book called Zoning Rules. And if you read Zoning Rules, he’s an economist himself one, who’s proficient in the law. And he has a good caricature of economists at the start of the book where it’s like an economist assumed that planners are just economically illiterate and stop the building of housing for some reasons due to their own preferences. And it’s like, no planners are responding to the demand for planning that when they put in land use restrictions, they’re doing so because they get reelected to do so, that people who come along and go, I will—but they won’t phrase it like this—I will preserve the value of your home by limiting the construction of new homes. That is a vote winner, right? Whatever way you’ve got to not dog whistle it in but you’ve got to indicate that you’ll do that without saying, "I’m going to price that new households," that’s a vote winner. And I think a lot of it comes from...there’s a website WTF Happened in 1971, right? There’s all these charts that suddenly just change in 1971. And we can think of lots of potential factors in there. But I do think the 1970s, the unexpected inflation in the 1970s, possibly driven by the oil price shocks or a combination of factors, including the oil price shocks in places like the US, opened the eyes of homeowners to the idea that if inflation comes along, your debt stays the same size in nominal terms and your property value goes up. So inflation is bad from a consumption point of view, but if you’re a homeowner, it’s good because the real value of your debt goes down. And we’ve known this, that’s why we had hyperinflation after World War I, countries wanted to get the real size of their debt down, just add a few extra zeros to your currency and the debt goes away, that kind of thing. But doing it for households in a mass home ownership environment, because of course what had happened between the 40s and the 70s in the United States is there had been significant attempts to boost the home ownership rate for potentially very good reasons. But what it meant was that the typical district that’s voting people in in the US or indeed in a European country now has a majority of homeowners and their interests may differ from other households. And that was a key turning point because once people were aware of that, they were able to co-opt all sorts of reasoning, some of it environmental or quality controls or whatever and use those as fronts for what is effectively preserving the value of the biggest thing on their balance sheet and in some ways they’re entitled to do that. If I own a home and in principle, I could go out there and actively try and minimize the new housing supply to maximize the value of my home. Now, I think that would be incredibly hypocritical of me given what I passionately believe about housing to be doing that. So I try and do the opposite. I try and argue for more housing, even though it’s not in my own interests. And the economists are laughed at for assuming people are always super automatons and rational and so on. But in my case, I’m living proof that that’s not the case, I suppose. But in general, I do think that that switch got flicked in say in the US in the 1970s and it didn’t happen in other places. And that might be because the age structure is different in Japan now, if you increase interest rates, that could be an economic spur to activity, right? Because the age structure of the population, they’re net savers as opposed to net borrowers or there’s different things going on in different countries or it could be just the way the shock is felt. The same shock, but it’s felt in different ways in different countries. But certainly if you look at Ireland, if you look at lots of European countries, if you look at the US, we have ended up with a system where the incumbents, the people who were there already and secured their housing have disproportionate power over new housing supply. Tamara Winter: It actually leads into...and I just have two more questions. The next question, which is, as you look...I find it unfortunate that, and I understand why these debates often get so charged, but I do find it a bit unfortunate and so I wonder as somebody who does support more liberalized zoning, what do you think are the most compelling arguments that opponents of liberalized zoning make? Ronan Lyons: I mean, there are...one relates to quality I think, and one relates to distribution, right? So people who...and I would have...in the Irish housing debate and people can go on Twitter and see, I would say something and you’ll have...there’s a group of people who will argue vehemently that, against say, if I argue for new rental housing in Dublin, because it badly needed, people would say, "No, the rental housing is getting proposed is not adequate." And they’ll say either, for example, either it’s not good enough quality, so we need higher quality standards. Personally, I don’t think that’s true of the housing that’s getting built at the moment. I think I’ve tried to come up with a measure of it. Of course I did, I’m an economist, but I’ve tried to come up with the measure of the quality of housing and I estimate the housing that’s getting built now about 50% higher quality in terms of the input materials than housing about 20 years ago. So I don’t think that’s true, but I’m sympathetic to the argument that if you build poor quality housing, you are creating future problems. So we should be rigorous in terms of housing. Now there’s an opportunity cost, which gets to the distribution point, the higher your minimum standards, the more of the income distribution you’re pricing out. And I estimate that say Dublin city’s minimum standards around 2015 priced at 90% of the income distribution and that’s pointless, right? It’s pointless having minimum standards that only allow 10% of people to enjoy new housing, because what you do is you create segregated markets. So from a distributional point of view, I think new housing shouldn’t be the preserve of the market or shouldn’t be the preserve of the state or whatever, I think we need a holistic approach that says, if you think of it as three groups in the population, you’ve the group that are rich enough based on current standards and prices to afford housing in the market. You have a group that are poor enough based on whatever the standards are for providing social housing, that they qualify for social housing. And then you’ve got a group in the middle who are not rich enough to afford market housing and not poor enough to qualify for supported housing. And really if I were a housing minister or a secretary, I mean, that is your goal. Your goal is to make sure that group doesn’t exist, that they’re either in the market or in the supported housing sector. And for both in order to achieve that, you need both those groups, the market housing segment and the social or supported housing segment to be responsive to underlying need. So that’s an argument where basically social or supported housing is a compliment to market housing. It’s not a substitute and I think that’s one of the...one of my get out of jail cards when some of my critics come along and say, "You’re just like a shield for developers and it’s all about profit for you." I have one guy who likes calling me a money astrologist because I’m an economist or whatever. I’m like, my estimate of housing need is high enough that I think the state should be supporting the construction of maybe 15 to 20,000 homes a year. So I don’t think...I don’t know of any competitor in Ireland’s case that has a higher estimate of socializing than me. I also have a higher estimate of market need, because I believe the underlying need say for one and two person households, as we get older, as we start our families later, all that kind of stuff is adding new housing need, diversity of housing need. So I think on quality and distribution, there are points to be listened to. I’m super reluctant to take into account…I think of this, right. I live in central enough in Dublin, I can see the Guinness tower, right? From my bedroom window. I can look at it and go, "There’s the Guinness Storehouse," which is like one of the most popular tourist attractions in Ireland. Now, it’s not particularly attractive, but suppose it were super attractive and I’m like, "That’s part of my view, right? Across the road, there’s a site that’s going to get redeveloped and they’re going to put in, I think, five or six stories in group of apartments. I think I should be entitled to say, "Well, yes, I don’t think you should build that because I have a lovely view.” Now I think that observation on the new development should be given a weight of close to zero, right? It is effectively irrelevant for society, right, that I have a view of the Guinness Storehouse from my bedroom window. It’s nice for me, I didn’t buy the property because out of the window, I can see the Guinness Storehouse or whatever it might be. I think we need to be a lot more clear about the weight we give to arguments that are effectively arguments to keep housing prices high. Tamara Winter: As you look across Ireland and then maybe more broadly across the world. Are there reasons for optimism on housing? Ronan Lyons: In Ireland, I think there are because things have been so...I mean, things were up and down for different reasons, but things have been so bad for the last 10 years that if you think of...just take the case of Dublin, Dublin is a city of about one and a half million people, about a half a million dwellings and the rental sector is about 150,000 rental dwellings, right? So not quite a third, but not far off. As things stand, they actually recognized this a couple years ago policy makers, they said, "We need to boost the supplier rental accommodation.” We are now in the opposite of the sweet spot. We’re in the eye of the storm at the moment because those plans have been lodged to build about 50,000 new rental homes but very few of them have come on stream. So you’ve people saying, "Look, you changed these rules three years ago," and of course COVID came in and didn’t help. And you changed these rules three years ago and nothing has changed. In fact, rents have gone up. Things are getting worse, not better. And I look and I see about 40 to 50,000 rental homes coming down on stream over the next five or six years. And I say, Dublin is going to be such a better city for having 200,000 rental homes rather than 150,000 rental homes. And yes, the new 50,000 are going to be expensive, but we have made them be expensive because we have high standards. And I know some people will disagree with that but I do believe that that’s true. We have high standards and the new rental accommodation is going to be expensive, reflecting that. So that’s the...I’m a natural born optimist. I see things getting slightly better and I do, and again, in the case of Ireland, I think the things were so bad in providing which you might think of as social or supported housing over the last 20 years. It was a decision in the early 1990s, implicitly, nobody ever stated this, but implicitly, it was let’s stop providing lots of social housing by the state and by lending more and more risky mortgages that we...and the US did the same thing effectively that that will step in, the market will step in for the state. And we know post 2007, that that’s not a reliable way to provide housing for all, but for about 10, 12 years in Ireland’s case, there was not a huge amount of progress. And just in the last 12 months or so, there’s been a bit of progress in terms of cost rental. So Jane Jacobs writes about this in her book about how would you provide housing for all…the Death and Life of Great American Cities. She talks about what we would call cost rental is that, if a third of your income is the most you can spend on housing, how could, what do you do for people for whom that’s not enough to cover the cost in new housing? And you got to top them up to get to that point. And Ireland is introducing a system a bit like that. And I think that’s going to make social housing or non-market housing, more responsive to underlying need. So I’m an optimist for Ireland, even though I could also give you the list of clouds in the horizon or things that I think are wrong, let’s go with optimism. More globally, if I’m an optimist it’s earlier in the pipeline of optimism, it’s hard to point generally. And it’s hard to summarize generally about housing. And there’s a couple of books actually, that I’ve seen coming out recently, one’s called Mass Housing, I think, and it’s trying to synthesize across countries. And actually some of my own work...I’m working on a project that’s funded by the National Science Foundation looking at housing prices in the US since the civil war and trying to measure prices at a city level. And in doing that and in doing the same for Ireland and in doing the same for Canada to contribute to an international, not debate, because I think that sets us up in the wrong, but International evidence base around what’s happening in housing markets now and how it fits into a longer term picture. But I’ve digressed a little bit. The drawing, I suppose, drawing conclusions about the global housing system or even the housing system in the high income world, if I’m optimistic, I think it’s because there’s a lot more people who believe housing to be important to research. And we know so much more than we did 10 years ago, so that’s on the research side, that of optimism. I think that will filter through into the policy side, but I do think that every country is going to have to come up with its own way of wrestling with the, yeah, the promiscuous veto with the power of incumbents and some of it, some countries may not be able to solve that until you’ve...things have got so bad. You’ve got a majority of renters in certain key parts of your country and then the power switches. Tamara Winter: Ronan, that’s all I have. Thank you, so, so, so much.

Archived audio: Is it for real? Oh, it’s for real now. Tamara Winter: It’s New Year’s Eve 2016. Then governor Andrew Cuomo and his wife descend an escalator underneath second avenue in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Behind them, ride a gaggle of men in suits and women in evening gowns. Cuomo flashes a smile to one of the dozens of cameras followed by a thumbs up and a wave. They turn to board a colorfully decorated new subway car emblazoned with the words second avenue. It’s the kind of grandiose ribbon cutting moment that every politician dreams of. Archived audio: We needed to show people that government works and we can still do big things and great things, and we can still get them done. Tamara Winter: But this was no ordinary transit project. It took nearly a century to finish, and it was the most expensive per-mile subway project ever. Welcome to Beneath the Service, a podcast from Stripe Press all about new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. In our last episode, we looked at rising housing costs. Today we’re looking at what could be considered the other side of the same infrastructure coin, transit. I grew up in a suburb of Dallas, Texas. We have the Dart, or Dallas Area Rapid Transit, but its efficiency and convenience leave a lot to be desired. According to census data compiled by homearea.com, the share of commuters in the Dallas Fort Worth Metro area that use public transit is—1.4%. And that tracks with my experience. Growing up, I would take a train once in a while, but only on special occasions to the Texas state fair or the stockyards in Fort worth. Trains were a special treat, not something that was part of my main transportation diet. By contrast, I moved to New York City in 2021 and the city subway has just become a part of my daily life, as it is to 3.1 million other New Yorkers. And I learned that only a few years before I arrived, a new subway line opened underneath second avenue in Manhattan. It was a rare new addition to one of the largest and oldest subway systems in the world. Phase one of the project was completed in 2017. It is a modest two miles of track and three stations. It runs through the upper east side neighborhood. The price tag was around 4.4 billion dollars, and that’s just one of the four phases of construction. Phase two will extend the line north into East Harlem and is expected to open sometime between 2027 and 2029. The cost of phase two is expected to surpass that of phase one. Phases three and four would extend the line along Manhattan’s East side, all the way to the financial district at the Island’s Southern most point. These phases currently have no funding commitments or timelines. I guess the thing that gets me is that this subway line was first proposed in 1920, over 100 years ago. So, why has it taken so long to construct? Why is it costing so much? And what can we learn about public transit? Not only where the Second Avenue Project got it wrong, but where other places get it right. Sarah Kaufman: In New York city the subway is the lifeblood of the city. Tamara Winter: This is Sarah Kaufman. She’s the Associate Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University Sarah Kaufman: At NYU I do research, I conduct events, and I teach mostly around the topic of transportation and technology. Tamara Winter: She’s also worked at the city’s transit agency itself. Sarah Kaufman: I previously worked at the MTA, which is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority here in New York, which is the organization responsible for New York subways and buses, as well as several bridges, tunnels, and highways. Before COVID the subway was handling about five and a half million people per day. And then we also have the largest bus system in the country. And before COVID, it was handling about 2 million people a day. New York City does not function without its subway and bus systems, because that is how everyone gets around. In a lot of US cities, the only people who take buses or trains are lower income people, but here in New York you could be sitting next to a multimillionaire or someone who is very low income and everyone’s riding it together. It’s a great equalizer. Tamara Winter: Today, the subways might be the city’s lifeblood, but a quarter century before the first trains began running underground, elevated trains rumbled above Manhattan’s busiest avenues. Archival audio: Gleaming skyscrapers are traditional landmarks of New York, but there are other landmarks like the grimy ribbon of steel [inaudible 00:06:37]. Tamara Winter: They were loud, dirty, and choked the city’s street life under a canopy of metal. Archival audio: For 76 years, L trains clattered by carrying people to work and home again. But the old steel skeleton outlived its usefulness. Passengers dwindled, and so the L is being torn down. Tamara Winter: The city began phasing out these elevated trains, known to New Yorkers at the time as the L because the more modern underground subway lines were being built. Well, most of them were being built anyway. Sarah Kaufman: So the first concept for the Second Avenue Subway was published in 1920. And it was just an idea. And the city planned to start construction in the early 1930s, but as you know, the depression hit. And so there was no funding for a new subway line. Once the country recovered... Archival audio: Second Avenue. Miles of new housing need miles of new track. Sarah Kaufman: Different capital project amounts went into repairs and other subway lines and so there wasn’t funding for this project. There were fits and starts over time in the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s based on federal funding and state funding, as well as governance changes for the MTA itself. Archival audio: Much of the transportation future will be hidden below the ground in more than 50 miles of new subways. Soon, there will be a new two track subway that will run the length of Manhattan on Second Avenue, right up to the Bronx. Tamara Winter: The city did actually start construction in the early 1970s. However, New York City soon fell into severe economic and political turmoil, leading to high unemployment and rising crime. Archival audio: New York City Subway System. It has turned into a nightmare for the millions who ride it each day. The reason for the crime wave? The city says it doesn’t have the money to pay for transit police. Tamara Winter: Again, the Second Avenue Subway was put on the back burner. Sarah Kaufman: New York was left with several mini tunnels under Second Avenue, but nothing that connected and nothing that was yet able to have a train because these tunnels were not contiguous. Tamara Winter: The 1980s and ’90s saw the city crawl itself out of the fiscal hole and finally start to bring down the crime rate. In December 2001, just three months after the 9/11 attacks shook the city, research began on the impact of constructing the Second Avenue tunnels to the city and the environment. These impact statements were finished in 2004, and plans were developed for the next two years. Archival audio: One, two, three. Sarah Kaufman: So finally, construction resumed in the 2010s. Archival audio: We’re here today, starting up the tunnel boring machine, which you see behind me for the Second Avenue Subway. This is a tremendously exciting day. Sarah Kaufman: It was seen as a shovel ready project in the 2010s. A lot of it had to do with federal investment because this project was just too large for local or state investment to have completed. And so once there was a real federal commitment to transit, mostly thanks to Obama, the city was able to work on this project. Tamara Winter: That leads us to then Governor Cuomo’s grand opening gala. Unveiling a stretch of track from 63rd street to 96th street underneath Second Avenue. Archival audio: Thank you and God bless you. In a few minutes and we’re going have a great New Year. Thank you. Tamara Winter: So yes, nearly a hundred years later, the Second Avenue subway was eventually built. Well, one of four parts were built. And pre pandemic, the line saw around 200,000 weekday riders. That’s more than the entire Atlanta Rapid Transit System. So sure it’s doing its job, but then there’s the issue of cost. Sarah Kaufman: The Second Avenue subway was the most expensive subway built in the history of the world in mile-per-mile basis. Tamara Winter: The total cost was around $2.6 billion per mile. Sarah Kaufman: There’s a lot of great research done about construction costs in the US being just astronomically high. If you look at the work of Alon Levy... Alon Levy: Okay, I found the sound recorder. My name Alon Levy. Tamara Winter: Alon Levy is a transit researcher. They run the websites, Pedestrian Observations, and the Transit Costs project. Alon’s interest in transit costs started when they were studying for their PhD in New York. Alon Levy: I got an interest in the subway. It’s just a thing that people do in New York, they ride this train. And I saw, okay, this is how this system laid out and started thinking about maybe gaps in the system. What could we edit? What would we change? And somehow this has gone to trying to compare it with a lot of other big systems. And this is when I realized, just through a little bit of Googling, that the construction costs of subway construction in New York, the Second Avenue subway were very high. Tamara Winter: That led them to look at other subway projects. Alon Levy: They checked a bunch of huge global cities. Tamara Winter: Alon found that the global average cost of transit projects was around 400 million dollars per mile. The Second Avenue project was six times that. This led them to start the Transit Costs Project. It’s a website that catalogs the costs of transit projects around the world. Alon Levy: Right now we have a database, it’s something like 600 items. We have close to complete coverage of subways built in the last 20 or 25 years. Tamara Winter: The Second Avenue subway is extreme, both in timeline and cost, but it’s not unusual in the US for transit projects to fall behind schedule and go over budget. According to the Transit Costs Project, transit projects in the US are the sixth most expensive in the world. The countries that are one through five are New Zealand, Hong Kong, Qatar, Singapore and the UK respectively. However, there’s an important caveat to the data here. Digging tunnels and building underground rail, like a subway, make construction much more expensive than simply laying down rail over land. The five countries I listed are building projects that are more than 80% tunneled. New Zealand and Singapore’s projects are a hundred percent tunneled. In the US only 37% of track is tunneled. Alex Forrest: I think among countries which are capable of developing rapid transit, I would say the US performs pretty badly. It’s not that it’s without any bright spots. There are so many little things and big things that are broken about transit in America. Tamara Winter: This is Alex Forrest. Alex Forrest: I’m a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. Tamara Winter: We met online several years ago, through Twitter, naturally. I immediately became a fan of his insight and how he communicates his ideas about transit Alex Forrest: As with how transit got to be in its current state in America, there are so many culprits here. It’s hard to know where to start. Tamara Winter: Culprit one: labor costs. Alex Forrest: With our construction crews, we need them to be professional trained, doing the best work possible. So we don’t want to sell them short, but at the same time, we need to come up with contracts that can actually ensure that there will be future contracts or else, what are we doing here? Tamara Winter: Here’s Sarah Kaufman. Sarah Kaufman: As compared to most other countries that have transit systems, employers in the US have to pay out worker benefits, which significantly adds to the cost. Subway construction happening in France for example, the cost would be somewhat lower because the employer would not be responsible for the health and wellness of the workers. Tamara Winter: Culprit number two: practice. You know that old saying, “practice makes perfect”? Alex Forrest: The USA had a first rate best in the world transportation system, well into the 20th century. Archival audio: And here’s one of the most wonderful things about this vast country of ours. No matter where we want to travel, there are trains. Beautiful, comfortable… Tamara Winter: At its peak in the early 20th century, the US had over a quarter million miles of railroad tracks. Nearly every major US city, from Atlanta to Los Angeles, had either street cars or subways that a majority of commuters took to work. For more reasons than we have time to get into in this episode, the latter half of the 20th century saw the tides begin to turn. Alex Forrest: At that point, we have another host of structural decisions coming into play that kind of limited our ability to rebuild the system or to modernize it properly. And that kind of led us where we are today. Tamara Winter: There’s no consistent new building of transit projects. And so everyone is all kind of out of practice. So when a new project does need to get underway, it’s like starting from square one every time. Alex Forrest: A lot of transit agencies in the US should be developing in-house capability. The less you need to contract your plans, your operations, et cetera, out to external vendors the better you are just at the industry in general. The more things that we can be good at, the more effectively we can spend our money. It always sucks to see a huge chunk of your budget that isn’t even entering the transit system is just being paid to you to give to a consultant to do work that you should really know how to do yourself. Tamara Winter: Culprit number three: transit agencies. Often in the US, a patchwork of different agencies all have different motives. Sarah Kaufman: Here in New York, and this is true in several other US cities. We have this division of jurisdictions that is hard fought. The subways and buses are run by one organization, the commuter rails, Metro North and Long Island Railroad another. Meanwhile, we have the path train, which is one of the commuter trains to New Jersey run by the Port Authority, and then New Jersey Transit, which runs other trains to New Jersey. It’s pretty incredible how many different organizations needs to come together. And frankly, they don’t. When you look at other countries, they have more of a regional and national perspective on coordinating interests across boundaries. Tamara Winter: Lastly, perhaps the most guilty culprit: Us, the public. There’s that other old saying, time is money. Well, in the case of transit projects, the longer these things go on for, the more expensive they get. These delays are often a result of NIMBYs. People who favor projects in general, but when they happen near them, they say not in my backyard. We discussed NIMBY attitudes around new housing development in our previous episode. And the same issues can be seen when it comes to transit projects, too. Sarah Kaufman: We do have a public engagement process where people can oppose transit and here in the US, people wildly oppose transit. They do not want buses and subways coming to their neighborhoods and overwhelmingly they come to community meetings and oppose it. Whereas in other places, the community has less input because it’s seen as a community betterment project. And so that process, which can take years here, is a non-issue elsewhere. Tamara Winter: Residents will often weaponize regulations such as environmental protection laws in an attempt to stop what they see as an encroachment on their neighborhoods. Alex Forrest: People are loathed to have large construction projects. And so, tremendously excessive measures have to be taken to make sure the project is as not disruptive as possible, which perversely can end up dragging it out and making it disrupt people for longer. Trying to keep up with people’s demands about any given projects, not the least of which is the ability to block any given project or just modify it endlessly, which also adds costs. Tamara Winter: All these factors add to transit costs in the US. Excessive labor costs, a lack of in-house planning expertise, multiple out of step transit agencies, and NIMBY’s dragging out project timelines. Part of the reason that Alon Levy started the Transit Cost Project was because they believed that if the US was able to look outside it’s borderers, the shared knowledge and learning from other global cities will help transit projects everywhere. Even New York. Alon Levy: There’s this unfortunate tendency in New York to say, oh, New York, especially, you don’t have anything to learn from. So we don’t have anything to learn from to a degree. We don’t have anything to learn from Milan. We don’t have anything to learn from Stockholm. Tamara Winter: Every transit system has things it does well and things it can improve on. But the more I dove into the world of transit, the more I realize that all roads, or all railroads, lead to one place. Japan. Tamara Winter: This is the sound of Shinjuku station. It stretches for more than a half a mile through the Shinjuku ward and the heart of Tokyo. The area is a major commercial and administrative hub. Every day it sees 3.6 million passengers making it the busiest public transit center in the world. There are five railway and subway companies that intersect here. They link the Tokyo Metro to lines that service the suburbs West of the city. By one account, there are 53 platforms and over 200 entrances and exits to this massive complex. There’s also long distance bus service. While Shinjuku is the busiest station, it’s hardly alone. There are nearly a dozen other major transit hubs spread across various wards in Tokyo. Each of these services 1 to 3 million passengers daily. The rest of the world doesn’t even come close. Take New York’s Penn Station, the busiest train station in the entire Western hemisphere. It sees over 600,000 weekday passengers. That’s one sixth of Shinjuku station. In fact, of the 50 busiest train stations in the entire world, 45 are in Japan. Train ridership can only get to these high numbers when the system runs effectively. In fact, in Japan it’s nearly perfect. Junichi Sugiyama: So desu ne. Hai, hai. Tamara Winter: This is Mr. Junichi Sugiyama. Junichi Sugiyama: I live in Yokohama, Japan. Tamara Winter: He’s a journalist who writes about train, travel and business. And he’s ridden on every single rail system in Japan. Junichi Sugiyama: Next I’d like to like to ride the Amtrack across the United States. I will practice my English to help with my travels. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: Japanese people feel proud that the railroad system is so reliable and punctual, and when they can say there’s a train station close to where they live. Punctuality and accuracy is the most important thing so that people know exactly when to leave the house and when they will arrive at their destination. Tamara Winter: Let’s look at the Long Island Railroad, which operates out of Penn Station. The system considers a train on time if it arrives or departs within 5 minutes and fifty-nine seconds of the scheduled departure. Even with this generous measure, nearly 20,000 trains run late every year. Now contrast this to Tokyo. Every year the city’s entire system experiences accumulated delay of 20 seconds. Even these precious few seconds are an infraction worth an apology, like this statement that went viral in 2017. Archival audio: A company in Japan is apologizing after one of its trains left 20 seconds early. The company released a statement that reads in part, we deeply apologize for the severe inconvenience imposed upon our customers. That’s incredible. For comparison, to review [inaudible 00:24:28]. Tamara Winter: Imagine a trained company in the US making a formal public apology for leaving 20 seconds early. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: By increasing the frequency of trains, it will be more convenient for residents in the area. And subsequently, the town will develop. Ultimately, the goal is to have an accurate and efficient operating system. Tamara Winter: Tokyo also manages to integrate its various train operators very well. Here’s Alon Levy. Alon Levy: Tokyo has something very precious, which is that it manages to integrate urban and suburban transit very well. So the commuter rail lines in Tokyo run through the subway system and moreover the subway system was built to form a tight mesh within the city, but also connect with these commuter lines. So Tokyo essentially built a subway system at metropolitan scale. Tamara Winter: The system in Japan is not without its drawbacks. For example, in Tokyo the high number of competing transit companies leave riders paying with a jumble of different methods. But it’s efficient and on time, and the high quality of Japan’s transit system extends into the smallest details. Here’s Alex Forrest. Alex Forrest: There’s something much more every day about the train in Japan. It’s not considered the purview of only the marginalized in societies. It’s what everyone uses and everyone expects the best of it. I remember one time in my most recent visit in 2018, I rode a train out to one of the suburban terminals, got off, the train went out of service and the driver immediately got out of his cab and began walking down the entire length of the train, something like 11 cars and just picking up every little bit of trash that he found. That wasn’t the final cleaning. Obviously they’re going to have a crew deal with it, but on his way out, he’s just going to pick up everything and then let the next crew take over. And so that kind of attention to detail and just insistence on regular cleaning and maintenance goes a really long way. And I think that kind of focus also helps with other things like maintaining punctuality. If you care about the details, the details work themselves out. Tamara Winter: Clearly, the Japanese love their trains. And like so many love stories, it started in a time of war. Following its defeat in World War II, Japan was occupied by the American military. In Japan this is referred to as GHQ, or General Headquarters. Its aim was to establish democracy and rebuild the country Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: Prior to the war, the Japanese National Railways, or JNR for short, was built and operated by the federal government. But, when the war ended, JNR was relaunched by GHQ in order to make the railway system more sustainable. Converting it into a public enterprise. Tamara Winter: The government operated railway became a government owned public corporation. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: JNR incurred a large deficit of 37 trillion yen, which almost exceeded Japan’s national budget. Tamara Winter: On top of mounting debt, confrontation increased between management and the labor unions leading to numerous strikes. Fares were up, ridership was down. It all came to a head in 1987. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: The country couldn’t support it anymore. So they made a drastic reform. All of this debt was settled and the private company was created. This was the beginning of the JR Group. The corporation was split into six private passenger companies. Each was designated a different region of the country. There was also a freight and research company created. Most of the JR Group companies were granted the freedom to operate as private entities. And so they made efforts to lure back passengers. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: From the perspective of the rider, the staff have become kinder. After becoming JR, they started to focus on service. Because it’s an independently profitable and private company, they felt that they had to make a profit. And in order to make a profit, a lot of customers have to feel comfortable and satisfied. So the employee education was reviewed and the service was improved. Tamara Winter: There was also a marketing push. One example is this now famous series of JR Group Christmas commercials in the late 1980s. Archival audio: Christmas express. Tamara Winter: The train companies were allowed to capture the upside of their own service. Junichi Sugiyama: [in Japanese] Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: It was stipulated by law that the national railway should not actually do business beyond building and managing railways. They were told that they could not invest in hotels, real estate, or super markets, as it would put pressure on private companies. However, once JR became a private company, it was possible to expand into new businesses, such as hotels, ski resorts, and real estate. Tamara Winter: And so JR Group companies had a larger financial stake in the areas around their train stations succeeding economically. Junichi Sugiyama - Translator: The biggest business is to use stations to build shopping centers or condominiums. The station is not just a train station, but a base for business. It’s where people gather together. So you can have a lot of different businesses there. When Japanese railways developed, they bought a lot of land at a low price first, and later put down a railroad track and then the price of the land would go up. So they would sell it. Many urban railways in Japan have operated not only as railways, but also by diversified management. Tamara Winter: Today JR East, the JR Group company that operates through Tokyo is the largest, fully privatized passenger rail company in the world. Alex Forrest: This method of assuming the future added value that a rail line will bring to an area and then developing based on speculation on that value around the station to guarantee your ridership in the future, which they call value capture nowadays. Tamara Winter: In fact, this is not that different from how railways in the US were built. However, there are several key differences. Alex Forrest: When a lot of people hear this idea, they think that is the only way that Japanese companies are making money. A lot of them are diversified. A lot of these inter urban operators also run department stores, which they plant at their main stations. They also run smaller convenience stores. They are property developers and they sell apartment buildings and things like that, but they make most of their money from transportation sales. The part that makes them the money is everybody riding those trains. This was usually not the case in the USA where the main goal was just to make a killing off the speculation, and then you didn’t really care what happened next. That was very good at getting things built and really bad at getting things to stick around. Tamara Winter: And given his own background, Alex Forrest actually has a unique perspective on this. Alex Forrest: When I was born, my parents were still students and they were both studying Asian languages. And so very early in my life, my family moved to Japan. I lived there for two years in a suburb of Tokyo called Mishara. Once a week, we would head down to the train station, which is maybe a twenty to thirty minute walk and take the train two stops over to go to church. This train, even though it is ostensibly a commuter rail service, but it runs like eight car trains using electric overhead power, every 10 minutes. At the higher frequency stops, it’ll be coming every 2 to 3 minutes. This is the first train that I ever rode. I moved out before I was even five years old. And so I came back to America and lived in the Boston area at this point. And the great news was there were still trains to ride, but even as a kid, I could tell the difference in terms of the noise of the vehicles on board. They were clearly very old. The stations were pretty grimy at best, and often a lot of things weren’t working. The whole thing seemed to be shambolic compared to how incredibly organized and punctual everything was in Japan and clean. From that point on, I’ve always been interested in what transit is out there in the USA, in Japan, in the rest of the world. By the time I was in middle school, I had kind of already cemented a personal goal for myself to make transit in America, or at least in Massachusetts, as good as transit in Japan. Tamara Winter: It’s now 2022 in New York. Archival audio: This is the 96th street train. The next stop is 72nd street. Stand clear. Closing doors. Tamara Winter: The first phase of the Second Avenue subway has been running for just over five years. Archival audio: Good afternoon. We certainly meet in the most unusual places here in New York. Very delighted to be here beneath the second avenue subway. Something that we’ve been talking about for a very long time... Tamara Winter: Governor Kathy Hochul has moved forward phase two of the project, largely thanks to president Biden’s $23 billion infrastructure investment and jobs act. Archival audio: Ladies and gentlemen, next stop 125th street. With that, I’d like to introduce a gentleman... Tamara Winter: And the investment will go even further at this time. While phase one served mainly a high wealth area, phase two will extend into East Harlem, a neighborhood, largely working class and highly reliant on public transit. According to the governor’s office, 70% of residents here use public transit to commute versus the citywide average of 55%. For the people along the next phase of Second Avenue, this development would be a huge life change. And that’s the thing. Transit is the type of infrastructure with the power to change people’s daily life. Whether in New York, or a city like Dallas, where I grew up. Alex Forrest: New York, you get this great mixing of social strata on the train, unlike you found in Dallas. And what’s the critical difference here, right? Is it that New Yorkers are cleaner and more polite than people from Texas? I don’t believe that’s the case. I think what’s going on here is just that New Yorkers have a much more useful service around. There are lots of problems in the New York subway, but just the fact of its availability, that’s still useful enough to be pulling people from all realms of society together to take advantage of it. And it becomes just an everyday part of life. And I feel like this is probably the single largest thing that I wish I could convince more American transit operators to take seriously, the idea that you’re not offering a service for any subset of the population. You’re trying to offer a general purpose service, which is therefore useful to every subset. Anywhere there’s a person, there’s at least a potential rider. Tamara Winter: In the end, I am perhaps foolishly optimistic about the prospects for a more transit oriented feature in the US. For one thing, young people are becoming more vocal about their desire for alternatives to driving. And as America continues to age, developing these alternatives will be increasingly important for seniors who don’t want to be relegated to their homes in their later years. I see bright spots like Cul-de-Sac, a new car-free city development being built in Tempe, Arizona and private companies like Brightline in Florida and Texas Central are also developing intercity rail projects in places that have long been deeply car-centric. I’m hoping we’ll see a lot more experimentation in the years to come. Alex Forrest: I’ve always said, inertia is the hardest thing to overcome, and it’s not that there’s anything technically infeasible about modernizing transit here. It’s just, we haven’t done things differently in so long. Even convincing people if they need to do things differently can be very difficult. Sarah Kaufman: America has a real addiction to cars and most of our communities are built around use of cars. And so it can be very hard to give up car usage, even if somebody tried. At the same time, I think that the younger generations in the US are seeing that and taking advantage of transit and biking and other options as better ways to get around. I hope that the interest in transit continues. Tamara Winter: Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. The senior producers for this series are myself and Everett Katigbak.

I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. We’ll see you next time. Tamara Winter: Welcome to Beneath the Surface B-Sides, where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. On the most recent episode of Beneath the Surface, we focused on the state of public transit in the US, and we compared it with one of the most train loving countries in the world: Japan. For this episode, I interviewed Alex Forrest. He is currently a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. I’ve been a fan and a friend of Alex’s for years. He’s cultivated a community of trained fanatics on Twitter…train Twitter that is, where he shares his thoughts on the state of train travel in places like the US and Japan, where he lived for several years as a child. His username is @380kmh, which might seem a bit random, but it’s the top design speed for most high speed trains. In our conversation, we discussed his current work in Springfield, the formative years he spent in Japan, the history of train development in the US, and more. So here is my conversation with Alex Forrest, which has been lightly edited. I hope you enjoy. So the first question is always the hardest. Introduce yourself. Tell me your title and why are we talking today? Alex Forrest: My name’s Alex Forrest. I’m a transit planner for the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission in Springfield, Massachusetts. And we are talking today about transit around the world and how to do it well. Tamara Winter: Tell me a little bit about your current work as a transit planner. When we were chatting about this episode a little bit, you told me that you just won funding for two lines. Is that right? Alex Forrest: Two bus routes, right. So my work in transit is limited to bus operations. That’s the transit provider that I work for, operates out of three bus garages in Western Mass, about 35 to 40 routes. It varies a little bit by time of year. And in the past couple years, I was able to win funding from MassDOT to operate two new services. Both are kind of longer range intercity kind of services. One of them runs on a roughly hourly frequency on the Interstate. The other is just a three times a day through a state highway connecting to Worcester, it’s a service that we’ve had a lot of interest in riders from. And I’m a little disappointed that we couldn’t provide more than just these three round trips, but it was great to be able to get that running. Tamara Winter: Talk to me about the transit situation broadly in Massachusetts, and also kind of how does the transit system in the broader north-east differ from the rest of the US? Alex Forrest: Massachusetts works nicely as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country in that you have Boston, which is our north-east, I suppose. And then you have the rest of the state, which I mean, the rest of the state was settled very early. So it doesn’t necessarily have the same town patterns that you’ll find in the rest of the country. But in terms of transit availability, I think it’s a working analogy, it does the trick, which is to say MBTA is the transit provider in Boston. They run four subway lines, one of which doubles as kind of a surface streetcar route. They run a myriad of bus lines, including some nominal BRT routes. They also run ferries and commuter rail around Eastern Massachusetts. So very extensive network. One of the top performing networks for ridership in the USA. There are also, I want to say, maybe 15 or so regional transit authorities elsewhere in the state. Most of which have sort of one central city and a defined service area. And their job is to provide exclusively bus operations. Now it’s not written in, but that’s just how it works out, throughout the other parts of the state, not a bad model conceptually, but one of the oversights of it is that they made no account for travel between the regional transit authorities, which is why this route to Worcester was such a big deal. I mean, in Eastern Mass, the various regional transit authorities at least can get close to Boston or connect to an MBTA service. But beyond Worcester, that starts to become impossible and broadly speaking, the RTAs obviously get a lot less money than the MBTA. They have much cheaper services to run in the first place, but one of the consequences of this is that very few...it might only be PVTA, which is the one that I work at, very few RTAs actually offer weekend service. Most of them only offer service on weekdays. I think until recently, that was the case, even in Worcestor, which would be the next largest after us. But you will want to look into that. I’m not sure, they might have started running weekend service recently. Tamara Winter: It’s kind of wild though. You said this is sort of a microcosm for the rest of the US. Talk to me about how you would rate the US public transit system kind of compared to other countries specifically in regards to rapid transit. And when you decide on a rating, I’m curious why the US merits that rating. Alex Forrest: I think among countries which are capable of developing rapid transit, just because that is an admittedly pretty high bar, and so a lot of countries are still working on that or don’t really need to, I would say the US performs pretty badly. I don’t know about a out of 10 score and it’s not that it’s without any bright spots, but just there are so many little things and big things that are broken about transit in America. As far as the analogy goes for Massachusetts, one of the issues is that transit is very much a localized affair. And so where it exists at all, you might have reasonable transit, but anywhere else as kind of a national system, it’s sorely lacking. So connections between city areas are probably the worst component in the USA. And then within cities, there are various other issues just concerning schedule availability. Like I talked about the no weekend service, that’s hardly unique to Massachusetts, it’s true all around the USA. Even some rail systems. I want to say the Los Angeles commuter rail, I’m not convinced they run on weekends, or if they do, most commuter rail systems which do run on weekends, offer greatly reduced service. So, they prioritize specifically the times when they think it’s most likely people will ride. Which again, that sounds very reasonable, but that’s not actually the best way to run a transit network and we have empirical evidence to suggest otherwise. So we don’t need to be led by assumptions there. Tamara Winter: To ask maybe a silly question, because there are theories that I can see, for example, for why this is the case. The US developed much later than its peers, the decision-making power to create transit, particularly between cities is kind of difficult to, I guess, manage because of our Federalist system. Why is our transit so lacking? Alex Forrest: As you kind of suggested, it’s definitely one of those path dependent problems. The system is lacking here just because we sort of evolved this way through various small decisions. But the part of the reason we’re lacking now is because we’re actually very, very far ahead of the curve, about a 100 years ago. And it’s not quite as simple as the success went to our heads and we thought nobody could do it better than us, and so if we can’t do it well, we don’t even need to bother. It’s not quite that simple, but that’s definitely part of it. And the USA had a first rate, best in the world transportation system, well into the 20th century. But even before that, even before the early 20th century, there were some fundamental problems in how we developed our system. And those problems led to complications when the original developers of railways and local transit networks in America started to run into cost issues, not entirely just because of a lack of business, but also because they were hamstrung in their ability to set their own fares. A lot of municipal ordinances would require transit providers to operate a flat fare across an entire region, which is not best practice. You really want to charge by distance traveled. And also, that flat fare was limited. At the time, I think it was a nickel or a dime, just because we’re talking about the 1920s, ’50s here. The inability to raise fares to deal with drops in revenue kind of ensured that the old railway operators couldn’t survive and a handover would be necessary. So then we get to kind of step two, which is the mid-20th century handover when a lot of the trolley companies were replaced by bus companies and the intercity private railways got out of the passenger business entirely with the formation of Amtrak. And so at that point, we have another host of structural decisions coming into play that kind of limited our ability to rebuild the system or to modernize it properly. And that kind of led us to where we are today. There have been various attempts, no shortage of money spent, although at the same time, kind of not enough, it’s complicated. I guess you could say they spent the money on not the best things for keeping the system going. And even to this day, a lot of baked in costs like that, just from the way we’ve done things so far. I’ve always said, inertia is the hardest thing to overcome. And it’s not that there’s anything technically infeasible about modernizing transit here, it’s just, we haven’t done things differently in so long, even convincing people they need to do things differently can be very difficult. Tamara Winter: It’s funny, if we were re-cutting a trailer for the podcast today, most of what you just said would be kind of a prime target for it, because I think this is kind of the crux of creating infrastructure. From the outside, as I’ve been talking to people, whether they’re building new cities, so talking about kind of what is it about Lagos that would necessitate a new city? Or for example, the Salton Sea and its potential to be kind of a lithium mine, it’s interesting. There isn’t kind of one culprit for why things aren’t better than they are or why some things worked. It really does appear to be kind of pack dependence in inertia all the way down. And you add into that, infrastructure typically doesn’t have...it needs a policy entrepreneur, but it’s very difficult to kind of just make large scale changes even when we know what it is we need to do. And I guess speaking of cost, you kind of mentioned this in your last answer. I’m curious, if you could elaborate, in your experience, why are transit costs in the US so much more expensive and why does it take so much longer to develop transit in the US than in other similarly situated countries? Alex Forrest: Before I get started, I want to just break down the two main sides of cost in transit. One being the operating expense, just to pay the drivers, maintain the vehicles, keep the service on the road. And then the other being capital expense, which would be to replace the vehicles, get new ones to build any stations, garages, any kind of train service requires capital expense on its track. Both are more expensive in the USA, but the operating costs are, I would say, a lot more defensible by and large. They’re not perfectly defensible. There’s some problems there too. Really, it is the capital costs that are the biggest problem. It’s the large infrastructure projects. Those are the ones where the costs are just wildly inflated. And again, as with how transit got to be in its current state in America, there are so many culprits here, it’s hard to know where to start. There is the kind of NIMBY angle where people are loath to have large construction projects. And so, tremendously excessive measures have to be taken to make sure the project is as not disruptive as possible, which perversely can end up dragging it out and making it disrupt people for longer. So it’s trying to keep up with people’s demands about any given project, not least of which is the ability to block any given project or just modify it endlessly, which also adds costs. Part of it has to do with staffing and what, I guess, I can only call unrealistic agreements with labor. Which, again, this comes back to the inertia thing, it’s obviously critical that we have well paid and compensated drivers for any of our vehicles. You don’t want people crashing on the road. And likewise with our construction crews, we need them to be professional, trained, doing the best work possible. So we don’t want to sell them short, but at the same time, we need to come up with contracts that can actually ensure that there will be future contract. What are we doing here? This is a problem that Japan had a crisis with in the late ’70s to 1980s, which ultimately led to the privatization of their national railways. There were various causes, it boiled down to a labor dispute and they were able to work it out and solve that issue back then. So yes, in the USA, right, we have just regulations. People’s ability to interfere with the project can ramp up the cost tremendously. We have relatively expensive labor, not even the expensive labor is the issue, but the overstaffing, where you just have way more people on a crew than you particularly need to do it. This also shows up in transit operations where you might have...the practice of having conductors on a train to pick up tickets is definitely not the way they do it in Japan, for example, where either if a train line is so quiet that you can’t just have fare gates at the station, then the driver of the train will check the tickets instead of having another guy wander around to do it, needless to say, those are only on the quieter rural lines. So I guess that’s only two subjects right now. There are more, I don’t even want to get started on the EBA and requirements for environmental impact statements, which, again, depending on how zealously the jurisdiction wants to push the issue, they can take years, if not...I don’t think any have taken more than a decade. Tamara Winter: Well, speaking of a transit project that took more than a decade, this episode begins with the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan, which was first proposed, I believe, in a little over a 100 years ago. I wonder, are there other transit projects you can think of in the US that have similarly been extremely, exorbitantly expensive and also taken forever just to get off the ground? Alex Forrest: Yes. I think, frankly, you would’ve a much harder time finding projects for which that isn’t the case. I know that just recently in Boston, there’s a lot of celebration as a extension of the Green Line into Somerville, Mass opened. This goes to Union Square in Somerville, which is very close to where I lived in the mid ‘90s, living just on the border of Somerville and Cambridge. So it’s very heartening to think that finally, my old neighborhood has its own stop. I don’t remember the exact year, but I do remember when this project was being discussed back in at least 2004, if not earlier, I think versions of it have been on the drawing board since at least the 1940s. This particular round was finally authorized and it began construction sometime around also 2004, I want to say. And it was originally slated to open in 2011. So here we are now, it’s part open. There’s still more of it to open, which I think will open later this year, but they haven’t even finished opening it yet. And I’m as happy as the next guy that it’s finally here, but well over budget. I mentioned neighbors getting involved to just jack up the costs. Sometimes that does produce nice fruits, even if it does inflate the cost significantly. In this case, it involved connecting to a multi-use bike path, which branched off the Green Line Extension. There was already a bike path branching off it. They just wanted to run the bike path parallel to this new extension and connect it into the larger city bike network. A nice addition, but again, not strictly related to this project, did not need to get bundled in, inflated the timelines and the planning process, led to constant revisions. And so finally, here we are, halfway through 2022 and we’re not even done opening it. Tamara Winter: By Second Avenue Subway standards, that’s actually very, very impressive. But, of course, we are grading on the world’s biggest curve. Alex, I’ve known you for a few years and you have kind an unusual story with how you came into transit. Tell me a little bit about your unusual childhood and why you got so interested in transit in the first place. Alex Forrest: When I was born, my parents were still students and they were still kind of moving around quite a bit and they were both studying Asian languages. And so very early in my life, my family moved to Japan. This was in 1991, and I lived there for two years in a suburb of Tokyo called Machida. And I would describe Machida as on one hand, very much a suburb, outside the city proper, mostly single family housing, but also, it has nearly half a million residents right now. And it’s got its fair share of large buildings as well. So it’s a suburb, but a Tokyo suburb, to be clear. Anyway, living out there for two years, I was about old enough to go to preschool. I attended a preschool a short walk from my parents’ apartment, but every week, once a week, we would head down to the train station, which is maybe a 20 to 30 minute walk, shorter on a bike or a bus, and take the train two stops over to go to church. And so this train, even though it is ostensibly a commuter rail service, it’s far out in the suburbs, I don’t know, maybe 15 miles away from Tokyo, I’m not sure. But it runs eight car trains, using electric overhead power, every 10 minutes. And that’s where the local stops at the higher frequency stops, it’ll be coming every two to three minutes. So to have this out in the suburbs, this beautiful train, this is the first train that I ever rode, of course. And so if you look at Japanese culture, there’s certainly a carve out for the train nerds. They’re generally photographers. They like to take photos of trains and they know everything about them. I can see why kids growing up there would do that because the same effect hit me. The only difficulty was I moved out before I was even five years old. And so I came back to America and lived in the Boston area at this point. And the great news was there were still trains to ride. I was so happy. I didn’t have to abandon trains forever. The downside was they were American trains and that did not at all dim my enthusiasm as a five-year-old, six-year-old kid. I still loved riding them, but even as a kid, I could tell the difference in terms of the noise of the vehicles on board. They were clearly very old, the stations were pretty grimy, at best, and often a lot of things weren’t working. Just in general, the whole thing seemed to be shambolic compared to how incredibly organized and punctual everything was in Japan, and clean. So anyway, just from that point on, I’ve always been interested in what transit is out there in the USA, in Japan, in the rest of the world, just always taking the chance to ride it whenever I can. But by the time I was in middle school, I had kind of already cemented a personal goal for myself to make transit in America or at least in Massachusetts, as good as transit in Japan. Tamara Winter: It’s so crazy because the way you talk about Japan, I literally thought you had grown up there for many, many years. It’s amazing that all it took was two years and two of the most formative years in your childhood for you to kind of catch the train bug. Alex Forrest: Right. Well, and I have siblings as well and they didn’t quite catch the bug either. So it certainly depends on the person, but it was, I guess...you said it best, it was a very formative time in my life. And so those at the stage when I was just beginning to form memories, so basically, my earliest memories are of living in Japan, but I was also not so young that the whole thing was a blur. I had pretty concrete memories, for instance, of our trip on the last day when we were heading to Narita Airport, I remember the train we were on because it had a nice LED animated map showing the route we were going. And so I was just mesmerized, I could check off every station as we stopped on it and see the train in advance. Tamara Winter: You mentioned that you could clearly see, even at that age, the differences between US trains and Japanese trains. In your opinion, what are some of the main, maybe social and cultural differences that affect kind of how the US and Japan treat public transit? Alex Forrest: I think Japan has a reputation for very good manners and that’s incredibly well-deserved. In general, Japanese people are just very polite and they’re very social in public. They’re not going to make a mess in general or make a lot of noise or have a loud conversation, which is just kind of broadly refreshing, but hard to really imitate here. As far as kind of attitudes, social and cultural attitudes, there’s also sort of the impression that...and I mean, it helps to be on the cutting edge of the technology to do this, but there’s something much more glamorous and just every day about the train in Japan. It’s not considered the purview of only the marginalized in societies, it’s what everyone uses and everyone expects the best of it. Part of the reason that any reformers had any leverage here was that the public expected and demanded better service of the railways than they were delivering at that time. I’m hard pressed to come up with any more...you’ve heard the saying, "Why take a shower? I’ll just get dirty again." Tamara Winter: Yes. Alex Forrest: When, in fact, the point of taking a shower is precisely because you will get dirty again, so you want to be clean until that happens. I feel like that is kind of the attitude just as far as general maintenance goes. When I’m in Japan...I was visiting some years ago, I went to my old train station and they just had a guy...he was a part-timer apparently, but this is a very common thing there. They just had a guy walking up and down the staircases at the train station, just wiping down the banisters and walls, in the middle of the afternoon, it was 2:00 PM. He looked like he might have even been a retiree, which is why I gathered he was a part-time worker because senior citizens will often end up taking just odd jobs like that. But the fact that they actually have a position for this, you’re the guy who just wipes the station down every few minutes or so during the afternoon, they probably have another guy for the evening. But that kind of constant maintenance, much more so than people’s cultural inclination not to litter, is what makes the difference there. I feel like despite the well-deserved reputation for manners in Japan, people also tend to forget that they’re just human. People absolutely do litter there and they’ll leave things behind just out of forgetfulness, of course. I remember one time in my most recent visit in 2018, I rode a train out to one of the suburban terminals, got off, the train went out of service and the driver immediately got out of his cab and began walking down the entire length of the train, something like 11 cars and just picking up every little bit of trash that he found. That wasn’t the final cleaning. Obviously they’re going to have a crew deal with it, but on his way out, he’s just going to pick up everything and then let the next crew take over. And so that kind of attention to detail and just insistence on regular cleaning and maintenance goes a really long way. And I think that kind of focus also helps with other things like maintaining punctuality. Just if you care about the details, the details work themselves out. Tamara Winter: There’s something kind of interesting too. I don’t know the extent to which Japanese people just care more about their services, but it does seem like they expect more of their services than maybe we do. You can see those differences, we don’t have to just look at Japan and the US, even in say Dallas, where I grew up, and New York, where I live now, in Dallas, it’s expected that you really only ride the light rail if you need it as a connection downtown, let’s say you work downtown or just, if you can’t afford your own private transit, whereas in New York, I wouldn’t say it’s like Japan in that it’s totally ubiquitous, but it’s pretty ubiquitous, right? It’s not unusual to see people of very different kind of socioeconomic statuses riding the train together. And so even in the US, you can kind of see, and people in New York, of course, are accustomed to, and sort of demand much more. Alex Forrest: New York, you get this great mixing of social strata on the train, unlike you found in Dallas. And what is the critical difference here? Is it that New Yorkers are cleaner and more polite than people from Texas? I don’t believe that’s the case. I think what’s going on here is just that New Yorkers have a much more useful service around. And as you said, it’s not necessarily as useful and ubiquitous as in Tokyo, although certainly, it comes closer than anywhere else in America. And it’s also, certainly not as well-maintained as what you have in Tokyo. There are lots of problems with the New York Subway, but just the fact of its availability. As terrible as these trains are, as dirty or as overheated or whatever the problem is, that’s still useful enough to be pulling people from all realms of society together to take advantage of it. And it becomes just an everyday part of life. And I feel like this is probably the single largest thing that I wish I could convince more American transit operators to take seriously, the idea that you’re not offering a service for any subset of the population, you’re trying to offer a general purpose service, which is therefore useful to every subset. Whenever a new bus route wants to get proposed, you’ll usually have some interested party who says, "Ah, we need bus service here. There’s a lot of jobs here. There’s a lot of houses here." And generally, in this assumption is not just that there’s a lot of jobs or houses, but, "There’s a lot of low income houses here. We need a bus here." "Oh, there’s a benefit center here. We need a bus to go there." And so if you have a bus line that only goes between those two places, between the low income apartments and the Social Security offices, that doesn’t particularly do a good job of addressing the needs of people in those apartments or those offices, let alone anybody else. The people in those apartments also need to go to the doctor. They also need to go to the grocery store. They also would like to visit friends. These are all trip purposes that are being completely ignored in the calculus of where to put the bus and you can solve all these issues if you just stop thinking of, "Ah, we only need to worry about these particular people who are going to ride." No, you have to think about anywhere there’s a person, there’s at least a potential rider. Tamara Winter: I love that tagline. If there’s a person, there’s a potential rider. I want to talk about Japan a little bit more. Can you explain sort of briefly...although I don’t know if this is a brief kind of question, how Japanese rail companies operate as private companies? You’ve mentioned this earlier, but specifically around real estate speculation and development. Alex Forrest: It’s actually not that different, at least superficially, from how a lot of the railways in the USA were built up. Although there are, I think, a couple of critical differences that I hope I can get to, but the premise of the land use speculation really was something that happened around the time that the cities were still growing. And the railway industry was still pretty new in Japan, but you had suburban streetcar operators in say early 1900s Tokyo and Osaka. Some of which became quite successful and began running what in America, we would call interurban lines, which are not mainline freight, but they basically have the same standards in terms of their heavy rail operations. Generally running electricity, even for the USA back then in the 1900s. But in America, the interurbans all ultimately got shut down more or less, a few survivors, modern transit lines. But in Japan, a lot of them were founded as private companies. Most of them were able to stay as private companies and gradually phased away from streetcar operations to focus on their interurban lines, which over the years, were extended, branches were added, through service onto the subways was added. And so these interurban lines evolved into modern suburban rail. These are for companies that remain private the entire time. Japan also had a national railway industry, which originated as an amalgam of government funded lines and privately built lines, was run by the Imperial Japanese government through the war, and then by the reconstruction government after the war, and which was ultimately privatized in 1987 and broken up into several subsidiary companies. So the premise is you build a line out of the city, you develop the land around that line and therefore you plant passengers for yourself who will then use your line to go back and forth to the city. This is indeed how a lot of rail in America got built too, at least at the commuter level, not necessarily at the intercity level, but one of the most critical differences that a lot of people who are interested in this method, which they call value capture nowadays, assuming the future added value that a rail line will bring to an area and then developing based on speculation on that value around the station to guarantee your ridership in the future. When a lot of people hear this idea, they think that that is the only way that Japanese companies are making money. A lot of them are diversified. A lot of these interurban operators also run department stores, which they plant at their main stations. They also run smaller convenience stores. They are property developers and they sell apartment buildings and things like that, but they make most of their money from transportation sales. Cannot emphasize this enough. If you look at a suburban operator in Japan, yes, they are invested in land use. Yes, they do take steps to make sure that their own ridership will be there, but that’s not the part which makes them the money. That’s just the background work. The part that makes them the money is everybody riding those trains or buses. And this was usually not the case in the USA where the main goal was just to make a killing off the speculation and then you didn’t really care what happened next. You’d have a success where they take over the company. And that was very good at getting things built and really bad at getting things to stick around. And so, I think, that at least was part of why you had these interurban operators and streetcar operators in America running into trouble. I don’t mean to say it’s entirely their fault either. We cannot underestimate the impact of having tons of cars on the road, since a lot of American transit operators didn’t have dedicated rights of way, and so they’d be slowed down by anything that got in their path. But that’s also to say, I don’t want people to think it was entirely the evil car companies that did this. There were some really serious structural problems with American railway operators, which really doomed their efforts in the passenger rail business. Might have been overcome, but would not have come from the railways themselves, I don’t think. You would’ve needed a government intervention, which was a very, very tough sell and remains that to this day. Tamara Winter: That’s kind of the natural next question for me. So you say you might have an operator in kind of a regional line or a smaller line. Yes, they might invest in land and they might be speculating, but that’s really not where they make their money. How does that model compare to how transit agencies across the US are expected to function? Are there any US agencies that work like that? Alex Forrest: I don’t know if you could say there are any agencies that work like that, but there are, at least recently, some prominent private railway companies that have started operation. There’s Brightline in Florida, which is a private intercity railway line, which is, as far as I know, doing its best to develop the areas around its stations. You may be familiar with the term transit oriented development. Anyway, Brightline has taken advantage of value capture and TOD to build up its station areas. This is why they’re so interested in Miami and making sure their station location is close to downtown. Unlike the Amtrak Station, which is more peripheral. I know that Brightline is attempting to add a high speed line to Vegas from near LA. I’m not sure where that project stands. I just know that many operators have tried to do that route and the latest ones to step up to the plate are Brightline, so I wish them the best. The other one is actually a Japanese venture in America, where one of the companies that resulted from the breakup of the Japanese national railways is currently invested in developing a high speed railway line in Texas, between Dallas and Houston. In America, this is called the Texas Central Railway. It’s a subsidiary or partner company for the Central Japan Railway, which operates the busiest high speed line in Japan. The one from Tokyo to Osaka. And generally, as operations are, rural operations in Central Japan and commuter metropolitan operations around Nagoya, Japan’s third city. Tamara Winter: That’s one I’ve been hearing about for years. I didn’t realize it was a Japanese company behind that, which gives me a lot of hope for it. Alex Forrest: That has definitely improved my impression of the project as well. At the very least, I understand that the people who are working on it are technically very knowledgeable with literal decades of experience running the busiest high-speed railway in the world, whether or not that will be able to translate to Texas is still kind of anyone’s guess. But I don’t think you could find a better crew to do the job ultimately. Tamara Winter: Tell me, what do you think are the lessons and learnings for the US, as you kind of think back to your own experiences in Japan, and then now as a transit planner yourself, what do you think that US cities should aim to learn from the way that many Japanese cities operate transit? Alex Forrest: As far as learning from Japan, I’d already mentioned about planning for a general population. That’s pretty critical, but just as far as operations go, I think I would encourage them to not give up on the concept of farebox recovery. Even the most ardent transit advocates in America will frequently drop the line that there’s no transportation service that pays for itself. And this is where the reference to the Japanese providers, not only making their money from value capture is very important because usually the people who say that no system is profitable, will bring up the value capture argument to hand wave Japan’s example away, but that’s literally not true. A lot of these are publicly traded companies. You can look up their books and see where they’re getting their money from. I’d make a point to check the Odakyu Fact Book whenever they update it, which is once a year, that’s the line that I used to ride when I was a kid in the suburbs there. So we can confirm that it is indeed possible to make more than 100% of your operating costs from your fares. And the question is just, how do you do this? And there are so many ways to approach this that just don’t even get entertained because in America, they don’t think it’s an ideal worth pursuing. They don’t think there’s any finish line to that race. They think if you start focusing on your farebox recovery, you’ll never hit a 100%. You’ll waste a lot of time. You’ll have to make austere cuts on anything that isn’t profitable immediately. That’s really not how this works, really. If you’re only making 10% of your budget from fares, think about what you can do to get that to 20%. That’s not much, you don’t need to raise your fares necessarily, right? You might just need to change your fare structure. You might offer a discount on passes, which gets people to buy passes more often, which gets them to use the system more often. And then, hey, they don’t always have a pass or they might not ride the pass as much as the pass is paying for. And so you’re still making more money than if they never rode at all, right? Put it like this. If you buy a monthly pass for $50 and $50 pays for, let’s say, 30 trips on the bus, and you only use that monthly pass 20 times, transit operators has made a lot more money off those 20 trips than if they were all sold individually. And so, little steps that can be taken to improve farebox recovery. It’s not just about raising revenue, it’s also about reducing your costs. Obviously, you don’t need to change your fares at all if you can come up with a way to bring your operating costs down by, say, 5%, right? Again, it’s just that they don’t even entertain the idea that you could ever hit 100% profitability that they won’t take the smallest step in that direction. On the contrary, a lot of providers are talking now about trying to go fare free, which I admire where that’s coming from, but I can’t say that that would work out very well for us, even in the medium-term, let alone the long-term. Tamara Winter: It’s interesting because in the same way that a lot of the challenges that you see in infrastructure are not things that have a single cause, similarly, if you wanted to kind of fix sort of broken systems or even systems that are just operating suboptimally in some regard, these little changes...I wouldn’t necessarily think, "Oh, if you’re making 10% of your operating costs, maybe try and make 20 in revenue." That seems very doable. And I guess, as you look across the United States, do you see pockets of optimism? Alex Forrest: Yes. Not the least of which is my own local situation. It was nice to get a couple of routes approved. One of them’s doing badly, one of them’s doing well, but both of those were what I expected when I went into this. So I guess just things are going as expected there. Tamara Winter: Tell me again, just what did you get approved? And congratulations by the way. Alex Forrest: Oh, thank you. Thank you. And I should emphasize, I did not work on these grant proposals alone at all. So I had the collaboration of my great coworker over at PVTA, the director of planning over there. But one of the routes was a thrice per day, five days a week weekend-focused service, connecting Amherst, Mass. and Worcester Mass. The other is a roughly hourly to half hourly service along Interstate 91, between Northampton, Holyoke, at the Holyoke Mall and Downtown Springfield. Like I said a minute ago, the Springfield one has been a success. The Worcester one, not so much, but both are extremely well received. And the shortcomings of the Worcester route, I was well aware of when I went into designing the schedule with the very limited funds that were on the table. We, again, at the end of the day, only provide as much as people pay for, which is one of the reasons I think it’s so important that transit providers try to maximize their farebox revenue because the more your riders are paying for you to exist, the more you will be responding to the needs of your riders in continuing to exist. When you get all of your budget from state allocations, taxpayer funding, that money is just as good as any other money. The problem is that you have to address the concerns of the people giving it to you in order to get it. And their concerns may or may not line up with the actual interests of riders. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. The more of your money is coming from riders, the less likely you are to get paid to do something you wish you wouldn’t do, which happens all the time, I got to say. Tamara Winter: It’s a bit of a principal-agent problem. If the money isn’t coming from people that are actually using the service, it may or may not be useful. Alex Forrest: Right. Essentially, you’ll always reflect the priorities of whoever’s paying you to do your job. You want those priorities to line up with the users of your service, ideally, but as far as pockets of optimism, there are a lot. I think the thing which has had my attention the most in the past few years has been this phenomenon of bus network rationalizations. There’s a well regarded transit planner called Jarrett Walker who runs a private consulting firm, which I would say specializes in these network redesigns. Some of the fruits have been great. One of the first cities they went at was Houston. I know they’ve also done work in at least Miami, I want to say Seattle, and I want to say Rhode Island as well, at one point, or they might be doing Rhode Island now. I don’t quite recall, but these redesigns, essentially, they aim to have a cost neutral redeployment of existing resources. So you have X number of buses. You can pay X number of driver hours and X amount of fuel. Could you, just by changing where the buses are running, get a more effective system? Focusing on allowing people to transfer outside the central hub, as well as the central hub. Having services more frequent on more routes, even if that means having slightly fewer routes. The routes that you have will be higher quality. They’ll more consistently attract people to them because they’re more useful. And so this tendency doesn’t seem to be losing any steam. More and more cities are picking it up. The results have been very good where they’ve been attempted. This was pre-COVID, so I don’t know what happened after that, unfortunately, but pre-COVID, I do remember that any articles that would decry the general crisis of transit ridership in America would have to overlook Houston, which despite being a generally bus network, was actually improving its ridership at that time, while most of the country was struggling and losing ridership year after year, and it hadn’t been doing so before the redesign. So something clicked there and I want more cities to get this opportunity. I’ve taken a crack at it in my spare time, looking at our local network, but I don’t know. I feel like I’m maybe a little too in the weeds to do a good job. I’m already too accustomed to the usual special demands, special concessions, that I can’t quite bring myself to say, "Ah, well, rationally speaking, we shouldn’t do that." I know these guys too well, they’ll come yelling at me the next week if I mess it up. So it can be nice to have some outside eyes looking at it. At the same time, I think another thing that a lot of transit agencies in the US should be prioritizing more and some of them are, and doing a very good job at it, is developing in-house capability. The less you need to contract your plans, your operations, et cetera, out to external vendors, the better you are just at the industry in general, some of these Japanese suburban railway companies, one of them in particular, happens to also be one of the largest manufacturers of rail cars in Japan. So they make trains for themselves, but also for other companies in Japan and also around the world. Again, just the more things that we can be good at, the more effectively we can spend our money. It always sucks to see a huge chunk of your budget that isn’t even entering the transit system. It’s just being paid to you to give to a consultant to do work that you should really know how to do yourself. Tamara Winter: Alex, this has been honestly a delight. It’s crazy, I’ve known you for years, but I feel like I’m just meeting you again for the first time. It’s really wonderful to know that there are people working, not just in kind of the big transit systems, like in New York or in WMATA, in DC, but also in places like Springfield. And I appreciate so much that you gave us your time. Alex Forrest: No, thank you again so much for having me. It’s been a pleasure. It was great to catch up. We should definitely talk again soon.

Okay, that’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface B-sides. Archived audio Commercial: Why you eating a mint, baby? So I can kiss you on the face. Why? Because it’s National Night. What? Tamara Winter: That’s an ad for Mentos, the breath mint. It’s also kind of an ad for Singapore. It was launched in 2012 to coincide with Singapore’s National Day. Archived audio Commercial: I’m talking about making a baby, baby. You ready? Let’s go. Tamara Winter: National Day is celebrated on August 9th, the day that Singapore gained independence after separating from Malaysia. Traditionally, it’s marked by fireworks, official speeches and a massive parade. Archived audio Ladies and gentlemen, let’s welcome our cabinet ministers, senior ministers and deputy prime minister to The Float @ Marina Bay. Here come our cabinet ministers streaming into the… Tamara Winter: Dignitaries wave flags and the prime minister gives a National Day address, a little bit like the State of the Union in the US. In fact, in 2012, the same year as the Mentos ad, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong discussed Singapore’s falling birth rates in his address. Archived audio Lee Hsien Loong: But alas, we are having too few babies and therefore we have a problem. The long-term trend is down, but we cannot give up. We’ve got to do something about it. Married couples are having fewer children. On average, now, each married woman has two kids. Previously, it was more, so this number has also been coming down. Tamara Winter: So, Mentos to the rescue? Archived audio Commercial: It’s National Night. Let’s make Singapore’s birth rate spike. Birth rate ain’t going to spike itself. Singapore’s population, it needs some increasing. Tamara Winter: In the US, we aren’t used to ads like that, or to hearing politicians talk about these issues in the way that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong does, even though similar trends are at work here. The birth rate in the United States is also falling. Personally, I’ve always been drawn to these questions about populations. Birth rates, changes in the age of a population and what those numbers might mean. It always felt like a natural fascination to me. See, I grew up in a large family, and when I say large, I mean large. I’m not exaggerating when I tell you I don’t even know precisely how many cousins I have, and that’s just first cousins. Who knows how many second or third cousins I’ve got running around out there? And even though I haven’t met all of my cousins yet—they’re scattered across a few continents—I feel extremely fortunate to have an international support system that spans generations. I also want to have my own kids someday. And by the standards of most people my age, I want to have a lot of kids. But of course, the decision to have children is intensely personal. It’s also one that governments around the world try to influence in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. So I wanted to understand what impact these kinds of personal decisions can have at scale, and why governments have so often tried to influence their citizens when it comes to having children. Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface, a podcast series from Stripe Press, exploring new ideas and big questions in the world of infrastructure. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. So far on the podcast, we’ve looked at a lot of physical infrastructure: housing, transportation, cities, container ships. But why do we need all this infrastructure in the first place? People. It all comes down to people. So, in this episode, we’re looking at how a country’s population, its size, its growth or lack of growth, are perhaps the most critical infrastructure. Along the way, we’ll dig into one of the thorniest questions about populations. What happens when governments try to influence population growth and size through policy? Countries around the world put policies in place that influence their citizens’ reproductive choices. The United Nations Department of World Economic and Social Affairs keeps track of these policies. In 2021, their report listed 143 governments with fertility policies intended to either raise, lower or maintain population size. For example, Kenya has had government-led efforts to slow population growth since the 1960s. These programs, which began by providing basic contraception and family-planning information, evolved into healthcare systems for mothers and infants. By contrast, Hungary has recently made headlines for a distinctly different goal. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has spoken openly about wanting to raise Hungary’s birth rate, which is among the lowest in Europe. In 2015, the Family Housing Allowance Program created subsidies that increased based on whether a couple was married and how many children they had. The most benefits were available to married couples with three or more children. But Hungary has actually had policies in place to raise birth rates since the late 1940s. One country that has tried to both speed up and slow down its population growth through policy is Singapore, first by discouraging citizens from having large families and now by pursuing pro-fertility policies. So with that Mentos ad still ringing in my ears, I set out to understand what it was like to live with these ever-changing policies. How did people having kids in Singapore experience their government’s evolving attitudes towards procreation? Titus: My name is Titus. I’m 69 years old now. I have been in the government service for 25 years with the Housing and Development Board in Singapore. So that’s a little bit about me, and my wife and I, we have three children. Vimala: I’m Vimala and I’ve been a teacher all my life, taught for about 30 years, 35 years. Titus: We’re both born in Singapore and we have lived here for all our lives. Tamara Winter: Titus and Vimala have seen both sides of Singapore’s policy on family planning. Vimala: We lived through the times when we had this policy of “Stop-at-Two” family planning. Tamara Winter: After World War II, Singapore’s population was rising rapidly, much faster than its economy was developing. Even the introduction of family planning in the 1940s didn’t slow it down. In 1950, the population was barely more than one million. But by the time of independence in 1965, it was almost 1.9 million, close to double. Add to that, Singapore is a tiny island nation. It’s just 281 square miles. For comparison, the city of Los Angeles is about 500 square miles. A booming population, little room for expansion. So by the early 1970s, the government took action. Titus: You know, during our teenage years, I think the Stop-at-Two policy started somewhere the early ’70s. Tamara Winter: 1972. Titus: And we were our teenage years at that time. Vimala: No, it was early twenties. Titus: In our twenties, sorry. We were in our twenties at that time. That’s the purpose of the policy, to reeducate you on what is right and then what is wrong. I thought it was quite intuitive as well. One child, the child will be lonely. Two children, okay, he’s got a playmate. Three, if some mistakes are made then you have three. Tamara Winter: The Stop-at-Two policy, a combination of incentives and disincentives for families. Vimala: We got married in 1980. So my first child was born in ‘81, and after I gave birth immediately, I think the next day, the nurse comes to me and asks me, "What plans do you have for family planning?" So it was very strict at that time, and they wanted us to keep at two. So if you stopped at two, you had a lot of incentives. Like, they got us at places where it mattered a lot to us, which was the housing and health. If you had two children, both the children would get X number of dollars in school for them. But if you had a third child, then the third child would have nothing, that sort of thing. Titus: So you had to fund it yourself. Vimala: Yeah. Tamara Winter: Along with the policies came an aggressive PR campaign. Vimala: Maybe it was kind of a propaganda. There were campaigns, and very sadly, you’re told, "Two is enough," and "Because of two, you get X number of things." And so after a while, and we were young at that time, maybe in our late teens, early twenties, and then you start to see that, eh, it makes sense. Actually, I remember this poster very, very vividly in my mind with the father, mother and two daughters. And they say, "Boy or girl, two is enough." Tamara Winter: And those posters were inescapable. Titus: Once you have a government policy, the posters are everywhere, in government offices. Vimala: Bus stops. Titus: Public places, bus stops. Vimala: Yeah. Malls, everywhere. They just have different versions of it, but the idea is the same. Tamara Winter: Some other posters from the time directly promoted more drastic measures like sterilization, calling it "the best method for family limitation." Vimala: So if you stopped at two and if you sterilized yourself, the lady, she could get the best school for her child, whichever school she wanted for her child. And also the family could stay in some of the better areas in Singapore. So it was a very serious thing then, and most people adhered to that policy of "keep at two." Titus: Some of the ladies, actually, were sterilized, though of course, they took the more drastic action to stop at two. Many years later, when the government started encouraging people to have more children, there were some bad feelings that, "You had actually prevented me from having more children and now you’re telling me to have more children." So there were some of these undercurrents. Tamara Winter: So the Stop-at-Two policy in Singapore was more than just economic. Sterilizations took place on a mass scale with a peak of more than 10,000 procedures carried out in 1976. The Stop-at-Two policy was far from the only effort to limit population growth in developing countries. China’s one-child policy, which was put in place in 1980, is probably the most well known, but countries like India also put similar policies in place as far back as the early 1950s. But these kinds of policies often came at a heavy cost. One that has disproportionately impacted women. In Singapore, mothers, afraid they might be unable to bear the costs of a third child, were forced to make permanent, life-altering choices about their bodies. This was also the case on a much larger scale in China. Millions of women were sterilized as part of the government’s efforts at population control. Others were forced to undergo abortions. In some rural areas where there was a long-standing preference for male children, female infants were abandoned. And as a result, in China today it’s estimated that there are nearly 35 million more men than women. In economically-developed countries, the notion of having fewer children by choice gained traction, starting in the late 1960s, sometimes with an environmental argument attached. This anxiety about the world’s growing population was in large part because of one extremely popular book written by a husband-and-wife team. Archived audio Johnny Carson: It was about 10 years ago this month that Dr. Paul Ehrlich made his first appearance on the Tonight Show, and it elicited probably more mail than any guest at that time we have ever had on a show. It had to do with his book, The Population Bomb, and it was a major factor in launching the ZPG, which is zero population growth in this country. And since that show, he’s done about 25 shows with us. Tamara Winter: The Population Bomb, coauthored by Paul and Anne Ehrlich, was a sensation. Published in 1968, it predicted famine, drought and mass death due to overpopulation, all within the next 20 years. These ideas weren’t entirely new. Economist Thomas Malthus made a similar case in his 1798 book, _An Essay on the Principle of Populatio_n. But it was Ehrlich’s writing that brought these concepts to a broad, contemporary audience. Some paperback copies of The Population Bomb carried the typewritten warning, "While you are reading these words, four people will have died from starvation, most of them, children." Ehrlich’s argument, "Let’s make sure that the existing population cannot just survive but thrive before worrying about adding more people to the planet." Here he is in 1980. Archived audio Paul Ehrlich: We have a little over four billion today. Large numbers of them are undernourished. We don’t have enough energy to go around. People think the environment is deteriorating and so on. Why don’t we try doing a really good job with four billion people, see if we can do that? Tamara Winter: The legacy of this book, for better or for worse, lives on today. In 2019, a statement on the need for climate action, endorsed by over 11,000 scientists, was published in the Journal of Bioscience. One of the statements’ recommendations: stop global population growth. Now, the methods of population limitation proposed in this statement were mainly about personal choice, like increasing access to family planning services. They were not advocating restrictive government policies, but the anxieties that Ehrlich brought to mainstream attention are present. So I wanted to know, what is the state of population growth like today? I called up Clara Piano. Clara Piano: Alright. So my name is Clara Piano. I am currently an assistant professor of quantitative analysis at Samford University. My area of research is family economics, although I’ve also published in the history of economic thought and the economics of religion. Tamara Winter: In addition to being an expert on family economics, when we talked, she was also about to become a mom. Clara Piano: Yes, yes. I am eight months along with our first. She’s a little girl, and it has convinced me that no one is ever ready. I just really do feel like it’s been a privilege to not only be researching what I find most interesting, which is how families form and function and interact with society, but to be living it right now as well. Tamara Winter: So I asked her: is the world’s population still growing? Clara Piano: The world’s population is increasing, although much less than it was in the past. Tamara Winter: World population growth reached a peak in the 1960s. Since then, it has fallen. And within the next 100 years, the world’s population is actually projected to shrink. Researchers like Clara are keeping a close eye on these global trends because unlike Erlich, they see potential in a growing population. When we talked, she referenced the work of economist Julian Simon. Clara Piano: As Julian Simon would say, the ultimate resource is people. And of course, there are values of people beyond economics. I want to acknowledge that completely, and he does as well in his work. But basically, it comes down to the fact that people are not only hands. They also have brains and they have ideas, and population growth, even from the economic perspective, is not just a replication process but a diversification process. So the people who are being born now are going to have different ideas of how to do things that will generate technological progress, which is actually the source of economic growth. Tamara Winter: This is another view of population growth also captured by economist Michael Kremer in his 1990 paper, Population Growth and Technological Change. The paper is worth reading in full, but the takeaway is that as populations increase, so does technological advancement, which in turn increases economic growth, and more concretely, raises living standards. So population growth can possibly be a key to solving the existential challenges that Erlich described: like food and energy scarcity, and climate change. The theory goes, if there are more people out there trying to solve big problems, more possible solutions can be found. Shruti Rajagopalan: You live in New York City, right? That’s the greatest example of this. These kinds of places is where progress really quickens, where ideas multiply. That’s what we really need. Tamara Winter: That’s Shruti Rajagopalan. Shruti Rajagopalan: I lead the India policy research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. I’m an economist by training. I also direct the India grants for the Emergent Ventures grants program also at Mercatus. I’m a fellow of the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU Law School because, in another life, I did get a law degree and I work a lot in the field of law and economics. Tamara Winter: Her research on developing economies is rooted in India, a country with a massive and growing population. Shruti Rajagopalan: So India’s population currently stands at 1.35 billion. I know that’s sort of a hard number to even imagine. The United States, for comparison, where we are recording this, is about 330, 340 million people. So the Indian population is 18% of the world. Tamara Winter: India is projected to surpass China as the most populous country in the world within the next decade. While a growing population can put stress on a nation’s infrastructure, Shruti sees India’s numbers as one of its greatest assets. Shruti Rajagopalan: India already has the resources of a large number of people. Now we need to make sure that these people are healthy, that they’re educated, that they’re prosperous, that they can actually go into the ideas part of the economy and bump into each other. The ideas can have sex, and that can become the new engine of growth for not just Indian prosperity, but global prosperity. Because in the future, one in five people joining the workforce, globally, is going to be Indian. Tamara Winter: But not all countries are growing so rapidly, and some aren’t growing at all. So the fundamental question remains: how to ensure that people can have the number of children they want to have. Here’s Clara Piano. Clara Piano: So this is the billion-dollar question. There is an element of mystery about all of this, in terms of the declining populations around the world. However, there are some things that we know. We do know that as people have become more educated, particularly women, we see lower fertility, and this could be a variety of reasons. Some people think it’s better knowledge about family spacing, fertility decisions. I, from an economic perspective, the most compelling reason for me seems to be that just the opportunity of the cost of their time increases. Tamara Winter: With the kinds of economic benefits that Clara and Shruti describe in mind, by the mid 1980s, Singapore was changing its policies. Titus: The reversal in policy to have more children came in 1986. I think. Tamara Winter: It was in 1986 that the policy officially changed. As a snarky headline in the New York Times put it, "Singapore decides it wants lots of children after all." But the policy change didn’t happen overnight. Titus: 1984, the thinking was already quite clear. They started this graduate-mother scheme, graduate-mother policy, where if you are a graduate mother, you get more incentives— Vimala: School, education. Titus: For education for your children, tax incentives, including subsidy for even hiring a foreign maid. These were some of the incentives that were given for graduate mothers to go out and work, and also to have more children. At that time, anyway, there was a belief that smart women produce smart children. Tamara Winter: The shift wasn’t just from Stop-at-Two to, everyone have as many kids as you can. The new policy slogan was: have three or more, if you can afford it. And even then, the government preference was for highly-educated women to be the ones having children. The slogan and program were a little harder to distill in a soundbite than Stop-at-Two. It also had to convince a generation that grew up with Stop-at-Two messaging. Vimala: Among my siblings, we’re the only two who have three kids. All the rest have two. Even my brother, who married twice with each wife, he had two children. So it’s just like, "Oh, that’s the best number. It makes sense." Tamara Winter: When thinking about the intuitive power of Stop-at-Two, Vimala recalls a family night out at a restaurant. Vimala: When I had my second daughter, she kept telling us, "Oh, four of us, that’s just fine." I still remember we were at the restaurant, she said, "You see, there’s a table for four? That’s just nice for us." And so when I told her I was having my third one, she wasn’t happy at all because she felt that was really not the plan. So I think all of us had that in mind. We are very subtle... there’s subtle messages that they sent to us. Tamara Winter: Skeptical parents were only one of the barriers to Singapore’s new policy efforts. Another force was at work, a result of the country’s rapid economic growth over the years that the Stop-at-Two policy was in place. In the field of demography—the study of human populations—one of the major concepts is what’s called the “demographic transition.” This is the name for a phenomenon that has been observed in virtually every country around the world: it describes the shift within a country from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth rates and low death rates. There's an ongoing debate about what exactly causes this transition. Social and economic development—things like improved sanitation and better education, especially for women and girls—are correlated with declining fertility and increased longevity. The result: a more slowly growing population and an aging one, sometimes even one that shrinks. During the 1970s and into the 1980s, Singapore’s economic development was rapid, moving it further along the journey to, you guessed it, demographic transition. Since then, Singapore’s population has continued to grow, but the rate of growth has slowed and is projected to continue falling for the foreseeable future. So what does it mean to have an aging or declining population? Well, for starters the costs of supporting such a population can strain national budgets. And put more financial pressure on younger working-age people to support the elderly. Both individually and through expanding social programs. There’s also quite a lot of evidence that aging populations are less dynamic. And more hostile to new ideas. So as Singapore was going through its own demographic transition, it decided to work against the trend with policies that encouraged fertility. Some thinkers are encouraging economically developed countries to fight the demographic transition. To understand more about why Singapore and other countries are concerned about slowing population growth rates, I called up Matt Yglesias. Matthew Yglesias: I’m Matthew Yglesias. I write a newsletter called Slow Boring. I’m a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center, and I wrote a book recently called One Billion Americans. Tamara Winter: If you’re on Twitter, you probably didn’t need that introduction. The full title of his book is One Billion Americans: The Case For Thinking Bigger. And Yglesias certainly thinks big when it comes to the United States population. Matthew Yglesias: In some way, the population is the most important infrastructure of all. We’re talking about tripling the population density of the United States in this book. That would put us on a par with France. We’d be at about half the density of Germany. Most of the country is not unspoiled wilderness. It just has room for more people in it. Tamara Winter: He argues that a larger population in the United States would be beneficial to more than just technological development. Matthew Yglesias: I think it also matters for innovation and for culture that, part of the strength of the United States is that a lot of people come here to try to pursue their biggest dreams. And that can be technology entrepreneurs. It’s also movie directors. Like, if you do really well in New Zealand cinema, you get to go make a movie in America because we have a big audience, we have a big enterprise here. Tamara Winter: That New Zealand cinema example feels especially on point. Just a week ago, while we were finishing this episode, the biggest movie in the world was Thor: Love and Thunder, directed by Taika Waititi, who got a start making indie movies in New Zealand and had his international breakout with a mockumentary about vampire flatmates in Wellington. Now he’s in Hollywood making Marvel movies and scheduled to write and direct a Star Wars film. In his writing, Yglesias brings up a particular statistic, that many women in the United States end up having fewer children than they say they want. Matthew Yglesias: What’s interesting, though, is that in the ’70s, there was a really big decline in how many children American women said they wanted to have. For the past 20 years, you have not seen that decline in intended fertility, but actual completed fertility has kept ticking downwards. Tamara Winter: Listening to Yglesias, I was reminded that Clara Piano, who we heard from earlier on this episode, made a similar point. Clara Piano: Educated women in developed countries, in particular, have the highest fertility gaps, which essentially means that, although they say when they’re around age 25, "I’d like to have, maybe, three children," on average they end up having two. So that’s a pretty big gap and it’s, for me, a signal that there’s something going on that we don’t really understand. Tamara Winter: So what can governments do? Clara offers an answer that touches on some of the physical infrastructure discussed in previous episodes of this podcast. Clara Piano: At the end of the day, I think that, really, just the best way to think about this is to increase freedom quite literally. Because women and men, in general, are saying, "I would like to have more children." There are some barriers that are preventing them from having children, and so just basic things like increasing economic freedom, labor mobility, freeing up people to fulfill their plans, whether or not that’s economic or for their families. For housing, to be able to move and to increase the supply of housing so we can have rooms for the children. These are more promising approaches. Tamara Winter: So what does this look like in practice? The promising approaches Clara mentions point towards options beyond government policies aimed at directly encouraging or discouraging citizens from having kids. Maybe the problem is that people are being prevented from having the number of children they say they want because of rising costs of living, housing, social support, or any number of other pressures. So while building more housing, further expanding the child tax credit, increasing labor mobility, ensuring paid maternity and paternity leave, and promoting workplace flexibility might not solve every problem—I think they're policies worth pursuing anyway. Back in Singapore, Titus and Vimala ended up having three children. And though their third was born after the Stop-at-Two policy ended, there were still challenges and a lack of support. Vimala: When I had my third child in 1990, I had no maternity leave or whatever. I didn’t get a salary for two months if I decided to go on leave. Tamara Winter: Luckily, they have the kind of financial stability that allowed them to feel comfortable having a third child. Titus: Well, for us, actually, we were about to get married. Our idea was we would have children and, of course, at that time it had been ingrained in us two children. That was proper number to have. Even if we had three, we did not have an issue with that. We had our two children. First child was born in ’81, second one in ’85. And then, five years later, we were blessed with a third daughter. Tamara Winter: Titus and Vimala are both well educated and have stable jobs. The financial incentives and disincentives of the Stop-at-Two and have-three-or-more-if-you-can policies were a part of their lives, but they didn’t have to change their family planning decisions because of them. Today, they have three grown daughters with families of their own. Vimala: My mother was maybe my role model. My mom was a housewife and she worked, she was a very hard-working housewife, so I used her as, "Okay, I want to be a bit like her also." Because I read a lot, I’m a literature teacher, teacher of English and literature, so for me, having three girls, I tried to impart quite a lot of things that I enjoyed in my life to them, like poetry and taking them to plays. Seeing them come full-circle, like having their own families, I think that in itself is a joy. Titus: Yeah. I suppose when they were young, of course, there’s the joy as they developed and progressed. Achievements in school, achievements in other areas of art or whatever. That brings joy to us. And as my wife said, when they found their life partners, you know… Tamara Winter: Reflecting on the various policy programs he’s seen over the last 50 years in Singapore, Titus remains optimistic about the country and the future. Titus: We have lived in a fairly strict country. The standard of living is reasonably good. Salaries are reasonably good. And I think we are quite happy to have been born and living in Singapore. Tamara Winter: And Singapore continues to promote policies that support families that have more children. In 2008, paid maternity leave was increased to 16 weeks. And in 2013, one week of paid paternity leave was added. The government also offers tax breaks, housing subsidies, and even cash payments. Maybe this set of incentives will be enough on its own, or maybe, in 2022, the government will still be looking for all the help it can get and we’ll see a return of the Mentos ad. As we’ve been researching and preparing this episode, I’ve been saying that this one is for the mothers, because when it comes to decisions about having kids, the people who carry them for nine months are often the ones who pay the highest price, physically and economically. And I hope to be one of those people. So while it’s easy to get lost in the economic theory or the global-level demographic statistics, this is personal for me. And so many aspiring parents around the world. And very, very real. The kinds of policies we’ve been talking about in this episode could directly impact my life when I have kids of my own. Vimala didn’t receive paid time off to have her third child. The United States, where I will likely have my children one day, is one of the only industrialized nations that does not have a national standard for paid family leave. But what years of research into the causes of declining fertility rates have demonstrated is that economic policies, even very generous ones, aren’t necessarily enough to move the needle on birth rates. Extended families, communities and other layers of social support also really matter. They certainly did for my family. And at least in my circles, this fact is increasingly acknowledged. Some of my friends are even making concrete plans to raise their children together. So I’m hopeful. Hopeful that there can be policies and social structures in place that ensure everyone has the freedom to make their own independent choices about how, when and with whom to have children.

Original music for Beneath the Surface was composed by Auribus. Visit press.stripe.com to learn more about Stripe Press. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. Tamara Winter: Hello and welcome to Beneath the Surface B-sides where we bring you full interviews with infrastructure experts. If you listened to the most recent episode of the podcast, you heard a brief snippet of my interview with Shruti Rajagopalan. She is a Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center and leads the Indian political economy research program and Emergent Ventures India at Mercatus. In our conversation we discuss not only the economic implications of India’s population growth, but also she gives personal insights into India’s history, sharing some of her experiences growing up in socialist India and witnessing its economic transformation firsthand. So here is my conversation with Shruti Rajagopalan which has been lightly edited. I’m going to have you first introduce yourself and your relevant affiliations. Shruti Rajagopalan: That is relatively easy. I lead the India policy research at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. I’m an economist by training. I also direct the India grants for the Emerging Ventures Grants program, also at Mercatus. I’m a Fellow at the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU law school, because in another life, I did get a law degree and I work a lot in the field of law and economics. I host a podcast called the Ideas of India, which is an attempt to bridge the gap between academic ideas and political economy, real world problems in India. And my main area of research is writing about Indian political economy, more specifically, my training is in public choice economics, law and economics, constitutional economics. I’m a very classic George Mason University trained economist. So, that’s all my affiliations, I think. Tamara Winter: Wow, is what I’ll say. Wow. Shruti, I want to start off with some context about India. So, how big is India, both in size and population? And I’m curious, for somebody who doesn’t have an immediate picture of how large India is, how does it compare to the rest of the world? So I think it’s something like 17% of the world’s population? Shruti Rajagopalan: Exactly. So India’s population currently stands at 1.35 billion. I know that’s sort of hard number to even imagine, right. The United States for comparison, where we are recording this, is about 330, 340 million people, right. So, the Indian population is 18% of the world. Having said that, India is a very young country, right. So the median age is about three to four years lower than most developing countries and much lower than the developed Western world, which has an aging population. It’s the second largest country, in terms of population and barring natural disaster or existential risk, nuclear war, asteroid hit, it’s likely to be the most populous country in the world. It’s the sixth largest economy just because the size is so large. I think nominal GDP is about 2.7 trillion US dollars, something like that. Having said that, in terms of GDP per capita, it’s still relatively a low to middle income country. It’s about $2,000 GDP per capita. Just as a point of comparison, China is about 5X the GDP per capita of India. South Korea is about 15X, right. And the United States is about 30X. So, in terms of being rich, it’s great to have a very large country, but it’s even more important that it’s a very large number of people who are also very, very prosperous. Tamara Winter: I actually want to add one more question for context. So, I was born in Nigeria, we’ve talked about this a little bit and I saw a tweet forever ago, basically pointing out the futility of talking about a country like Nigeria as though it were one country, something like 200 different ethnic groups within the country. And I wonder to what extent is this also true of India? Shruti Rajagopalan: Absolutely. I mean, I think Nigeria and India are great examples of this kind of diversity, but also how difficult it is to paint the country in one color. So just as an example, Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest state in India, it’s the size of Brazil. The smallest state in India, Sikkim, is closer to the size of Bhutan, which is like a really small Himalayan Kingdom country, right. India’s richest states like Goa, which is a great place. All the tourists love to go to Goa. It has a GDP per capita closer to Jordan, right. And India’s poorer state, Bihar is closer to Haiti. So, that’s basically the difference, right. And there are some Southern states like Kerala, which have...great on human indicators, 100% literacy rates. Again, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which are relatively poor, they’re barely at the halfway mark. And in terms of linguistic diversity, there are 18 or 19 official languages, but they’re technically thousands of dialects. Very similar to Nigeria in this sense. The caste system is another point of fragmentation. There’s a lot of religious fragmentation, of course. Hindus are the majority in terms of population, about 83%, but it’s about 13, 14% Muslims, right. It’s one of the largest Islamic countries in terms of absolute numbers. I think it’s the second largest. So, in terms of religious diversity, caste diversity, ethnic diversity, it’s really, really big. You’d love this, the Cambridge economist, Joan Robinson, she once said that, "The frustrating thing about India is whatever you can rightly say about India, the opposite is also true." And I think this is really true also of Nigeria, in the sense, right. Anything you can say about one tribe, you can get the exact opposite example in another end of the country in a different state, in a different city. So I think that point is very well taken. So India, when we say...it’s just, I’m talking about a geographical boundary and a state entity and a certain kind of common culture, a democratic framework, those are things that hold Indians together, but you’re right. We got to get specific really quickly with countries like India. Tamara Winter: Well, now that we’ve said that, we’re going to zoom back out then. For anybody who hasn’t read How India Can Use Its Numbers, your excellent article, could you maybe summarize the argument and tell folks the context in which it appeared? Shruti Rajagopalan: I grew up in socialist India and at that time, the economic rates of growth were relatively low, but population was growing really quickly, because post World War II, with all the advances in medicine and infectious diseases or battling infectious diseases, suddenly you saw infant mortality drop, you saw people living much longer lives. There’s this huge boom in population. But if the size of the economic pie is not growing, it means you’re basically redistributing the same size of the pie with more and more people. So in this context, it becomes very easy to have a Malthusian point of view, which is people are the problem, right. Wherever you look, you think in terms of zero sum games, because that’s how socialist economies operate. There isn’t a positive sumness that comes from create and openness, but also, all the infrastructure is crumbling, right. There are too many people. Every time you need to get on a bus, you see that you got to elbow 15 people to even get on a bus, right. Or school admissions, right. Every single basic public service that you use, whether it’s roads congestion, whether it’s water runs out the moment you go to the public well or the public tap. So these kinds of problems led people to blame population and the government intervened in so many different ways. At one point, even policy called for sterilizations during the undemocratic time of the emergency. But usually, more benign ways of essentially reducing the population, right. And this has led to, I think, a basic misconception. We need to bring the focus back now that India has liberalized and now it’s actually a trading economy, it’s plugged into the global economy, that more people are actually a good thing, right. So as Julian Simon said that, "People are the ultimate resource." right. And why do we think people are the ultimate resource? I think that’s the insight which is a little bit harder for people who come from the Malthusian point of view. And this comes to why or where we think economic growth comes from, right. And it’s not coming from just more physical resources. Economic growth comes from new ideas. Tamara Winter: We take for granted the idea that having a large population is beneficial. You and I are doing this interview in the United States. You’re from India, I’m from Nigeria. So I’ll ask you directly, why is having a large population beneficial? Shruti Rajagopalan: This is a great question and it’s unintuitive to most people, right. Because most people just think, "Oh, there are more mouths to feed," right. Especially in socialist economies or developing countries, but economists and more and more economists who worked on growth theories, whether it’s Paul Romer or Michael Kremer, right. Their idea is that the central or the key to economic growth is new ideas, right. New ideas are more important than just some form of capital, physical capital or labor or something else, right. Once you recognize the power of ideas, the value of the population comes into focus, right. People, especially well educated people, healthy populations, smart, creative people in a space where they’re constantly bumping into each other, are the source of not just new ideas, but also how to combine these new ideas into more and more and more applications and that is really where economic growth comes from. And this is not just true of today’s tech economy or Silicon Valley or something very specific, right. Michael Kremer has this great paper, it’s called Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990. This is a generalized trend for all of human history. And you can even see this, you go to small island countries for tourism or something like that, you’ve seen that these populations can tend to stagnate. They need outside people to come in and trade with them all the time, otherwise they do stagnate, right. Whereas large connected populations, you live in New York City, right. That’s the greatest example of this. These kinds of places is where progress really quickens, right. Where ideas multiply. Matt Ridley has a great phrase, he says, "Where ideas can have sex," right. That’s what we really need, right. So now fortunately, India already has the resources of a large number of people, right. Now, we need to make sure that these people are healthy, that they’re educated, that they’re prosperous, that they can actually go into the ideas part of the economy and bump into each other, their ideas can have sex, and that can become the new engine of growth for not just Indian prosperity, but global prosperity. Because in the future, one in five people joining the workforce globally is going to be Indian. Tamara Winter: Shruti, in your article, you identified, I think it was three policy areas in which a large population could, if utilized well or if allowed to flourish, could really unlock other gains. What were those policy areas? Shruti Rajagopalan: Yeah, so I’ll tell you a little bit about India before jumping into the policy prescription, because I think it’s important to also specify the problem. So, as I said, the people exist in India, right. And India thankfully, is a democratic country with free movement, so that is a wonderful thing, unlike China, right. That’s the closest example of a country which has large numbers of people, but they’re not allowed free movement, free assembly and so on. But in India, there are a few really major problems. The first is that India’s internal market is completely fragmented. One of the reasons the United States has been such a huge economic success is the United States was one of the first and largest free trade zones. You can trade anywhere within the United States. That never quite happened for India because states had a lot of different taxation regimes. They used to have internal tariff regimes. If you’re shipping apples or banana chips from one state to another state, you have to not only pay tariffs and taxes, but the differential tariffs and taxes come with a lot of corruption, long lines at highways where bureaucrats and corrupt inspectors can extract lots of bribes from you. That was the economy, and that naturally fragments the economy into smaller and smaller parts. And the greatest losers in this are obviously the poorer states, right. Because they’re kind of getting cut out of the market. So the number one thing is how to make sure that India’s internal market stays unified. So for this, the Indian government already took one step, which is unifying the tax regime, right, from this splintered, many-state system to a unified value added tax, it’s called the goods and services tax, but they did it the Indian way. It has eight different tax rates. It’s very complex, it’s a complete mess. So, if they streamline that, that’s going to be a huge improvement. India also needs far better infrastructure and this is where the good news is. We know that if India unifies a single market, there’s going to be so much more trade and therefore, so much more revenue for the government that actually, the additional infrastructure is just going to pay for itself, right. It’s not a net loss to build more roads, right. Or to build more ports or railways and transportation systems, coal storage, warehousing. These are things that will pay for themselves, so that’s one major part of it. The second is India’s labor market is a complete disaster, right. And this is, again, goes back to the socialist history of...there are just about, I think 40 or 50 federal level labor laws and regulation, and every state has its own rules and own regulation, which means at any given point, if you’re a countrywide firm, you have to follow 200, 300 different codes of regulation. And there’s a labor inspection system, which is of course, very corrupt and can completely extract rents, but what that does is it makes it very costly to hire people in a labor surplus economy, which is a terrible, terrible thing. And therefore, and you’ll be familiar with this from the Nigerian experience, it gets pushed into the informal market. And what I mean by the informal market is that it’s basically just escaping taxes and regulation, right. There’s nothing poor quality of the informal market. My engagement ring, I’m showing it to Tammy right now, comes from the informal market, right. So you can have very high quality, very, very expensive jewelry, leather goods, artwork, all this manufacturing happening in the shadow of India’s regulation. And what that does is it doesn’t allow it to scale, right. When things can’t formalize, they can’t get access to credit. And more importantly, in the labor market, people can’t get gainfully employed in sensible jobs that are salaried. They’re basically working daily wage labor, right. So this really needs to get fixed. 80% of India works in the informal economy. So they need to be brought back in a way out of the shadows, into the light. And the only way to do that is to deregulate in a meaningful way, countrywide, so that it becomes very easy to hire labor and it becomes very easy for actually people to invest and develop their skills. And the third thing is India, for its state of development, got connected to the internet, right, very, very quickly. This has again, got something to do with its numbers, right. When you need to lay the pipes, right. Or to put down the infrastructure for internet or telecom connectivity, a very large size market helps, right. Because very large number of subscribers means that you can put in the capital expenditure required to lay the pipes. So in India, that happened really quickly. I believe 816 million people are connected to a mobile phone in India. So it has fantastic mobile phone penetration. I think three out of four households has at least one phone. So the household has access. And that means that...and data is so cheap in India that I believe at one point someone was telling me, I met someone who used to work at HBO and they told me that Game of Thrones is super popular in India, though, it never launched by then. Everyone was watching it on torrent or something because data and streaming is so cheap in India that HBO decided that, "Okay, this is a very large market. We need to simultaneously start releasing this in India because there’s this huge fan base." So I think because India got connected, a lot of the network goods as we call them, this is platforms, right. Especially...I mean, you work at Stripe, so you completely understand what I’m talking about, but even more basic, like Twitter, Facebook, any kind of platform good, Uber, all this has a massive market potentially in India, right. People should get used to how you and I speak because more and more stuff on Netflix is going to sound like you and me, right. Because that’s where the eyeballs are going to come from in the future. So I think this is an underappreciated insight and for some things, you just need more eyeballs, right. For things like subscription services, for things like Twitter. For some things, you also need purchasing power. So as India gets richer, then more people are also going to use Stripe Press, right. Not just Stripe, right. As India gets more educated. So I think this is an insight that’s really valuable. So these are three areas where massive amount of investment is going to help India in a meaningful way. Tamara Winter: I’m curious about the 1991 reforms in India and what effect they had on the Indian economy. Shruti Rajagopalan: Oh, this is great question and my current passion project. So, I should plug this because we run a project called the 1991 Project at the Mercatus Center right now. It started last year in July on the 30th anniversary of the reforms and the website is the1991project.com. So basically, India was a socialist economy and was increasingly growing more and more socialist, since let’s say about World War II until 1990. That meant that India was basically hugely impoverished, right. And there were years or decades when the rate of economic growth didn’t even keep up with population growth, right. So there were years of negative GDP per capita growth. And this was obviously not sustainable, but in the late ’80s and early ’90s, what actually brought the country to crisis was a balance of payments problem, right. India simply did not have enough currency to afford its huge imports, especially its oil imports and energy imports, and it didn’t export enough, right. It didn’t have enough foreign exchange. So it was this crazy economy where a lot of short term debt and ballooning interest payments, which could basically topple the currency and therefore, in a meaningful way, bring down macroeconomic stability. So something had to be done. And those years, the IMF and World Bank used to have something called the Washington Consensus and they would have this long list of prescriptions for countries who were going through this macroeconomic crisis. We’ve known about this in the East Asian countries or Latin American countries. India had had similar talks and exchanges before with the World Bank and IMF when this didn’t succeed, but in 1991, something very curious and interesting had happened. A lot of the people who were in the Indian government at that time had gone and seen the growth miracle in South Korea, in Taiwan, in Singapore, right. They had been to Western countries. They had worked at the World Bank and IMF as technocrats. They had studied in American universities and they brought back this idea that, "Hang on, markets and trade are not such a terrible thing." So there was a major shift away from these hard entrant socialist values towards, "We need to open up trade." So what India did in 1991, I’ll give you the Cliff Notes version and those who are deeply interested can go to the website, is it reduced import tariffs, it devalued its currency, right, in a meaningful way, and when I say reduced import tariffs, I mean, some of the average rate of tariffs was I think 155% and the highest tariff rate was over 350%, right. So it started bringing those down in a sensible way, so now people could actually import, and this is again, not so intuitive. If you can import better, you can export cheaper, because your imports just became more efficient and higher quality and so on. So India’s total, entire chunk of trade as a part of GDP started increasing. India started getting richer. But on the other hand, another major reform that happened was India had crazy industrial licensing. The kinds that you read in economic textbooks that are talking about the socialist calculation problem. The Indian Planning Commission would tell its industrialists or entrepreneurs, how many bicycles they can produce, how many Vespas they can produce, right. How much paper can be produced or printed in a given year? So this import controlled economy where they were told what they can produce basically became a shortages scarcity economy, right. Long lines for everything. Overnight, industrial licensing was completely eliminated in India by end of July 1991, except a few select industries where they controlled some things. This basically...I mean, now you say that, "Oh, you can produce as many bicycles as people are willing to buy?" And you can imagine the gains that just unleashes, right. So these were some of the reforms that happened that brought India out of a very strictly controlled economy, internally and externally, and integrated it to the global market. And I’m a huge beneficiary of it. At the time, I was seven, eight years old when the reforms happen and overnight, I went from choice between two chocolate brands, which weren’t even that good, now there were dozens of different kinds of chocolates I could eat, right. And Michael Jackson, who my sister adored and I adored, used to drink Pepsi, and now, we could get a Michael Jackson CD, right. We could buy a CD player and we could get Pepsi, which is what he used to drink. So my memory of liberalization is also very visceral, right. Even as a kid, I knew that something major’s happening and my life is so much better. Of course, I come from a very privileged, upper middle class background, but for poorer people, it meant shortages and lines went away. When they’re standing in line for their rations, now they’re no longer getting terrible quality. Now, they’re actually getting good quality rations or they’re getting better t-shirts to wear because they were imported from China or Taiwan, right. I mean their clothing bill just got cheaper, when people are very poor, that matters. So at every level, right. It brought this huge change in India and we’re working on a year long project. We are recording oral histories with technocrats. We’re trying to understand why these ideas changed. We’re trying to show the growth that it unleashed. India went from an economy that was growing at 3% or 4% to an economy that eventually started growing at 7, 8%. And for 25 years, India grew...sustained at about 6 to 7% on average per annum, and it has lifted 270 million people out of poverty, right. That’s the size of...it’s like creating a new prosperous country almost, right. That’s an extraordinary achievement. So, I think the 1991 reforms, after Indian independence from colonial powers, if there is one major thing that’s happened in India to make everyone’s life better, globally and for Indians, it would probably be that moment. Tamara Winter: I mean, that’s incredible and I encourage anybody listening to go to the 1991 Project and also, to keep following your work. Could you speak a little bit more to how the Indian government reacted to perceived overpopulation? Shruti Rajagopalan: Absolutely. So, it started in a benign way, right. It initially started with education programs. We need to tell people to have fewer kids and that sort of thing. And a lot of those educational programs were linked to women’s health, right. This is a huge stress on women, right. This kind of reproductive stress. Then, there were campaigns that encouraged more people to adopt birth control or use condoms and things like that, right. So at that stage, and this is all pre-AIDS, right. So this is not use condoms for safer sex, this is use condoms to birth fewer children, right. So this was what was going on in the heyday of socialism under Mrs. Indira Gandhi, who was then prime minister, at one point, India suddenly moved from a democratic to an authoritarian regime for about 22 months. This was the famous episode of the Indian emergency. So India called a national level emergency and civil liberties were completely disrupted or no longer guaranteed and the government became very oppressive, right. The entire opposition of India was jailed. One of the major policy programs at that time, which her son initiated in her name, was for sterilization. And they would just capture young men, young military age men, peak reproductive age rather, and they would take them away to these clinics and make them forcibly have this procedure. So it was just crazy for a little while, right. And it was obviously a hugely unpopular move. It went away immediately after the emergency. India has never done anything that terrible since the late 70s, but it did happen. Now, I want to talk for a minute about some of the unintended consequences. So in a poor country, which has a relatively high birth rate or fertility rate, and this is mixed with very high son preference, right. Culturally, countries like India and many countries in Africa too, including Nigeria, son preference. I mean, this is not uniform, but there are parts of Nigeria, there are parts of India where son preference is incredibly high. So not only should India have more people, it should have a lot more women. So this is one of the unintended consequences. I think this as a policy regime, has now been...it’s gone completely out of vogue. It comes up, some politicians will bring it up. In Uttar Pradesh recently, they said, "Oh, we need to limit to two children." Something like that, but this is no longer a major war cry of the socialist era. And I think there has been a lot of learning from China’s forced one child policy and how now it has this aging demographic that can’t quite carry...the next generation can’t quite carry the weight of this skewed demographic that’s going to age. So I think that is a learning globally, that you need to walk away from these very strict population control policies and I think India’s learned something from it. Tamara Winter: I just have two more questions because I know I’ve taken a lot of your time. To what extent does immigration matter for India, whether that’s in-migration or emigration? Shruti Rajagopalan: I think hugely. Indian diaspora does incredibly well abroad, right. And I mean, America’s a great example of this. There’s a fantastic book by Devesh Kapur and Sanjoy Chakravorty, it’s called The Other One Percent, right. And it’s basically talk about how the Indian diaspora in the United States is one of the most high performing groups anywhere, even within the States or anywhere in the world, right. So in terms of outmigration, Indians have done very, very well abroad and they have assimilated very well in a lot of different cultures. I think that really matters, right. That there is a group of people who are entrepreneurial, who are well educated and are syncretic and who can assimilate. In terms of in-migration, India’s neighboring countries, depending on which neighbor, may or may not have porous borders, right. So with Bangladesh, it’s a very porous border. In fact, there are millions of daily wage workers who cross the border, work in India and go back. Now, this is going to be lesser and lesser of a phenomenon, because I believe Bangladesh’s GDP per capita just overtook India’s, right. So as Bangladesh gets richer, we are not going to have an in-migration issue with daily wage labor, it might even be out. It might be Indians crossing the border to go to Bangladesh to look for work. In terms, but a lot of the borders are very, very strict, because it borders with China and there are conflict areas or it borders with Pakistan, which has been a very long running conflict area. So because of that, you don’t have this foot movement across borders, but India for all practical purposes has a pretty open immigration regime. It’s just a question of who would wish to come and work in India and naturally assimilate in that environment. So, it has to be someone who is...it’s very easy for someone who is English speaking, relatively elite, gets very easily plugged into the formal part of the economy. It’s quite easy to move to India and immediately find work and things like that. And India has so many examples of people coming in as BBC reporters and just staying back, right. Because they’ve assimilated almost too well. On the other hand, if you are looking to come from some of the poorer parts of Asia or Africa, it can be difficult to integrate into a country if you don’t know the lingua franca, and India is so specific in terms of its caste and religious and linguistic relationships that it’s not easy for outside groups to just immediately mingle on say, a factory floor or just come and buy agricultural land and become a farmer or something like that. So, the very typical migration that you see from an even poorer country in India to come to India and start picking cotton or something like that, you don’t see much of that happening in India. And as a percentage of population, it’s a blip. India has just got so many people that migration is not the route that changes numbers, meaningfully. Tamara Winter: One, I appreciate so much that you took the time and we’re both optimists, I think, and I wonder, to close this conversation out, what are, to your mind, the most potent reasons for optimism about India’s future? Shruti Rajagopalan: Lots and lots of people, right. And lots and lots of people who are getting better and better and get integrated into the global economy. And this is because of India’s own regime of relatively free speech, democratic systems and access to the internet. So, I should give you this example. Recently, I like collecting a lot of Indian art, especially tribal art. I bought a particular piece of art, it’s made on textile. It’s called Mata ni Pachedi. I can send you the picture and it’s by a wonderful artist called Sanjay Chitara. I hope I’m saying his name right, and he’s from Gujarat and it was...I mean, he’s basically vegetable dye on textile and it was sold on an online auction platform. I bought it sitting in a Washington, DC suburb and the payments were processed by Stripe, right. And so, this kind of integration has now made an artist who works on folk art in India so much richer because we have been able to connect with him and there’s massive gains from trade. Those are the sorts of things that make me incredibly optimistic about India. I think what is preventing India from reaching its full potential is basically, very poor regulation, bad government regulation. Government just needs to get out of the way and let Indians be entrepreneurial. And the second is just very poor health and education systems, which always...I think that really hampers people from reaching their full potential, right. How many wonderful artists and Einsteins and Mozarts and geniuses are hiding in India because they are not plugged into the global network, either because they couldn’t access education or they’re not healthy enough, or they’re not rich enough to afford a phone and an internet connection and so on, right. So I think those are the things, if India can manage to fix, I’m just very, very optimistic about its future, but most importantly, because of its numbers.

Whitney Chen was our production manager. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. We had additional editing support from Emma Jackson. Original music for the series was composed by Auribus. Visit press.stripe.com to learn more about Stripe Press. That’s it for this B-side. I’ve been your host Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface. B-Sides. Tamara Winter: Hello, and welcome to the final episode of season one of Beneath the Surface. I’m your host, Tamara Winter. Over the course of six episodes, we’ve traveled the world from London to Lusaka, from the Salton Sea to Singapore and talked to infrastructure experts and visionaries who are all working to find creative solutions to some of the biggest problems facing their communities and the world. So it’s not surprising that, well, we have a lot more information than can fit into the episodes we made. So today I’m sitting down with my friend and colleague Everett Katigbak. He’s the series producer for Beneath the Surface. You might remember him from episode two, when we visited his family’s plot of land near California’s Salton Sea. Together, we revisited each episode discussing some of the clips, characters, and stories that got left on the cutting room floor. We also got to talking about some of the big themes and episode ideas that we’ve been sitting on, ones that might make for an interesting season two, possibly a video spinoff? But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. For now, I hope you enjoy this look beneath the surface of Beneath the Surface. Everett Katigbak: Well, today we’re back in the studio talking about some of our highlights and lowlights and all the interesting things in between, our experiences in producing Beneath the Surface. Tammy just tracked the final episode, and now we’re just kind of reflecting on some of our learnings from it. Tamara Winter: I also wonder how many times we can say "beneath the surface" in this conversation, take a shot of oat milk every time. Everett Katigbak: So, Tammy, obviously we’ve kind of learned a lot through digging into these various topics, but maybe we can start at the top. The first episode was very kind of close to you, near and dear. And you have a lot of firsthand experience. What has happened in Zambia or what have we kind of just learned in Lusaka and in Nkwashi since we launched that first episode? Tamara Winter: I think what was particularly exciting about that episode, and I think for a lot of this series is that the stuff that we talked about is happening in real time. And that is very much the case with Nkwashi. So actually this week, as we speak and sit here in San Francisco, Mwiya and several other entrepreneurs are hosting the African Union and they are talking about just interesting ideas around trade and development and economic growth. And so I’m sad we couldn’t be there. But Nkwashi itself too, it’s amazing to see people move in. The residents of Nkwashi starting to kind of identify with the city and post about it. I think one of the things that was particularly interesting about that episode is that there’s a growth story within a growth story within a growth story. So we’re talking about a city in Zambia and then beyond that, we’re also talking about what it hopes to enable, which is like a really robust and flourishing technological ecosystem. So since that episode Nkwashi’s grown. There are, it seems like new interesting companies popping up, not just in Zambia, but across the continent, like every five minutes. So I’m optimistic. Everett Katigbak: It was really great kind of going from a place like Zambia and Nkwashi and then kind of bringing that somewhat closer to home. Obviously Salton Sea, was really kind of personal for me, but the most kind of exciting moment that I had there was actually spending time in Slab City and East Jesus and getting to meet a lot of the people that live off the grid there. And actually kind of realizing ultimately infrastructure is about supporting people. It’s the thing that kind of supports a lot of these different communities and lifestyles. Tamara Winter: More broadly, one thing I enjoyed about the Salton Sea episode, I think we could probably do a whole series on places that were, and then are now starting to come back. I mean, I don’t know that Salton Sea was ever on top necessarily, but it’s pretty striking that it went from being sort of the next Palm Springs to like an asthma machine. And so yeah, that could probably be its own series. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, it was interesting when, when we were there, I actually do recall quite a few like luxury cars, like Audis and BMWs driving around and exploring the area. And I can’t tell if they were just kind of extending their Palm Desert vacay or if they were genuinely looking at it from a developer’s perspective, because land can be had for pennies on the dollar there. But maybe there is kind of this thought that lithium is kind of permeating through the community and the people are starting to look at it as more of an investment. So it was really fascinating to see some of that going on. Tamara Winter: Yeah. And it just seemed like the conversation around Salton Sea is very much live. So I’m optimistic. I’m interested to see how GM kind of makes good on its commitment to have all electric vehicles by 2035. I’m interested to see what Tesla does there, what Ford does there. It’s going to be a place to watch, particularly if the Controlled Thermal Resources team can manage to make a breakthrough with the way that lithium is extracted. You’ll hear me say this a lot in this episode, I’m just very optimistic. Supply chains. Everett Katigbak: We talked a lot about, I think supply chains was probably the first episode that we really knew that we wanted to try and tackle this thing, not only because of how it’s been exacerbated by COVID, but also because I think the shipping container as a unit of measurement and as a metaphor and as an example for efficiency, actually gets kind of thrown around quite a bit in the industries and circles that we talk about. But just seeing you and Ryan Petersen interact was really fascinating. And seeing him kind of naturally dig into some of the storylines and the narratives that we talk about things like trade routes, historic trade routes, the Silk Road and how that was not only responsible for trading of goods, but also this kind of cultural transmission and how that shaped a lot of the people. You could almost see it as a cultural gradient throughout broader Asia and the Eastern Europe continent. So, that was really great. Tamara Winter: I think what was particularly interesting about this episode is that Ryan, it’s funny, he’s running one of the biggest companies in the world that’s focused on global trade. Despite the size of the company that Ryan is running, he had such a ground floor view of the acute challenges that the US, and kind of more specifically California, and even more specifically the port of Long Beach were facing. The thought to just like literally go out to the port and talk to some of the union workers and bring tacos. Everett Katigbak: Right. Tamara Winter: And literally just get people talking about what exactly was keeping people’s stuff so backed up was interesting. And it turns out that even though that was such a triumphant moment, when Ryan was able to help the city and really the state get that port up and running, there are still kind of persistent supply chain challenges. Everett Katigbak: Yeah. I remember, I think we had to rewrite some of the intros and some of the narrative bits to hear mainly because it was changing so rapidly. And I think when we first conceived the episode, things weren’t as congested in the ports. And then ultimately by the time we recorded, I remember going out to Malibu and seeing this long stretch of backed up cargo ships. And that was something I’d never seen. I’ve seen it in port towns, like maybe Singapore or Asia, but never on the California coast. So that was kind of mind blowing to actually visualize it. Housing, because a lot of it was Ben Southwood. I actually thought it was great seeing Ben Southwood in his natural element. When we were out there recently, I got to walk around with Ben and he’s just like a natural encyclopedic kind of tour guide, just hearing him point out very obscure, but also fascinating things about, "Look at this building. This brick pattern is because of this. And this is how it affects the building structurally." And going into ancient Rome and Londinium, and this was all within like a three block radius. So I really enjoyed kind of hearing him talk with the Haredi Jews, because they were able to kind of speak the same language, but also from very different perspectives, which was really fascinating. Tamara Winter: We knew we wanted to do something on housing, but the conversation around housing, why we don’t have enough of it, why it’s so expensive for me has gotten just extremely stale. And so it was really nice to see a very interesting community and maybe not necessarily the first one that you would think of being on the front lines of upzoning and really doing something about the astronomical rises in the cost of housing. So I really enjoyed personally, just learning about how Motty and Shmuel and the rest of the community were able to kind of solve their own problem. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, I guess that is one of the kind of things that changed even in the short time, since we launched this episode. I think we’re originally looking at it from a buyer’s perspective, looking at the markets, but then when you start looking abroad and realizing that even things like zoning, these are the things that are really impacting housing costs. And ultimately, what ties to the whole series together, I think it goes back to what a lot of things that Ryan Petersen was talking about, building materials and supply chains are also exacerbating housing inventory and things like that. One thing that I also started to see as a series unfolded was how all of these seemingly disparate topics were kind of connected through supply chain and infrastructure, ultimately. Tamara Winter: One thing I particularly appreciated about that episode was that I think sometimes with infrastructure, it can be such a big topic. It’s something that everybody needs, but it also has a ton of different stakeholders and the costs of infrastructure don’t necessarily always present themselves immediately. Everett Katigbak: Yeah, and it was really great to see. I mean, a topic like housing, there’s so many different vectors that can influence the ways that things like laws and zoning and ultimately building go. And this was a good example of them working with the municipalities local kind of government to retain the kind of historical sense of the area, but also kind of to address their cultural needs. Oh, transit was a great one. It was actually great to see kind of Tammy exploring her new surroundings out in New York City. In the episode she started off being a Dallas born and bred person, but moving to both places like San Francisco and New York that actually heavily rely on public transit. It was also really fascinating again, since we recorded and shipped this episode, there’s actually been some progress with bullet trains out in the Dallas and in the broader Texas area. So I’m wondering how that impacts you and your relationship with your kind of home base. Tamara Winter: Yeah. My sister texted me about that news. She loved the transit episode. So I’m from Dallas. My sister is in school in San Antonio right now. And so she was extremely excited about the bullet train. And I think people in Texas, I mean, that project has just made a ton of sense for a long time. So Texas I’m rooting for you. We started the housing episode talking about the fact that I had lived in San Francisco, DC and New York and kind of my experiences with renting in each of those cities. But the transit one is almost as striking, right? So each of those cities is very walkable, but the experience of taking transit and getting from point A to point B there is just very different. But I knew that I wanted to do an episode kind of as a thank you or a love letter or a like, thanks for welcoming me to New York. So it was really exciting to kind of explore the Upper East Side, to see the actual Second Avenue subway line in action. But it was just incredible listening to people talk about Japan and London and just other cities. I think what’s particularly striking about transit, even though it’s extremely difficult. It’s multifaceted. They’re all different agencies. There are like labor issues. There’s like what the public wants and will allow in their backyards. All of these things end up being impediments to transit. And yet some countries and cities still manage to get it done. Everett Katigbak: You know what, one thing that I observed, even in the kind of very few times that I’ve ridden Japanese trains, it is like quite a user-centric experience. I think it integrates very well into the landscape. It kind of connects this kind of futurist vision that people have of Tokyo and this kind of ancient historic version of Kyoto and the broader area. And it’s not a destructive process. Oftentimes we think of building trains, especially in the United States, it means that we have to tear down or retrofit something that’s historic, and it does change the landscape and make it look and feel different. But in Tokyo, these layers are able to exist in a way that I think is actually, I don’t know, it preserves their cultural history, but it also kind of projects Japan as this very futuristic and forward thinking place. Tamara Winter: Population. I mean, this is the episode that I was most excited about. This is the one I knew I wanted to make no matter if we made any other episode, because I don’t have any special love for buildings and trains and roads. It’s all useful insofar as it serves people. And so I think questions and population are just fascinating. I mean, years ago I got really interested in birthright trends in the first place and what governments were doing about it. And so you could probably sit for hours and just go down a non-stop list of downright comical things that governments are trying to do to address what they perceive to be the sort of big challenges of having an aging population. And so it’s everything from, we talk about Singapore in the episode. What we don’t talk about is like the time that some of their train stations had literal cartoon eggs on the floor, reminding women that they only had like a finite number of eggs, to Italy’s fertility day to the classic Australian campaign, 40 is the new 20, except if you want to have children. And so I was interested in moving beyond the kind of friendly cringe shaming of women and their sort of expanded choices about rearing families and to really kind of observe how people make decisions about fertility. Everett Katigbak: Yeah. It’s really interesting to see how Singapore kind of uses that lever or kind of turns that dial almost the way that we do here in the States with interest rates and things to kind of really stimulate or catalyze the economy because they’re kind of trying to envision 10, 20 years down the road, what the populace is going to do and how they’re going to impact all these things there. But ultimately, it does come down to like people and human capital as the main driver of economy because that’s why we do and make and build the things that we do is ultimately to kind of support and service people and human’s needs Tamara Winter: This episode, I was both very excited about, and that made me kind of uncomfortable because it turns human beings into kind of these fungible widgets that you can just kind of like turn on if you need more and turn off if you need fewer. It’s the one episode again, that I was kind of the most excited about going into it. And it’s also the one that I have the most questions, regrets. I don’t know what you would call that about. There are lots of things within population that are interesting. Decades ago, South Korea had a gender ratio that was like India’s. A lot more men than women due to a lot of like sex selective abortions and kind of social pressures to have more sons. And today their gender ratio is more like Canada’s. How does that happen? That’s a whole story in and of itself. And that right there may be the story of the series. That within every episode there was a thread that we barely got to pull. That could be an entire story in and of itself. It has been such a joy to work on this series, to sit down with climate scientists, population researchers, train nerds, housing analysts, and city builders, and to reflect on how all our lives are shaped by the infrastructure we build. If there were any questions that came up for you while you were listening to the series or just to this episode, let us know. The world of infrastructure is vast. And even though we’ve gone beneath the surface of six facets of it, I feel like in a lot of ways, we’ve only begun to scratch the surface. So get in touch with us. You can send an email to stripepress@stripe.com or you can tweet us at @StripePress or @_TamaraWinter. Well, you’ve heard me say it at the end of every episode, but Beneath the Surface is a production of Stripe Press. And since this is the last episode of season one, let me tell you a little bit more about Stripe Press. Our mission is to spread ideas for progress. So we publish books, produce movies, and yes, make podcasts all about people working for progress. One book that we recently released is Pieces of the Action by Vannevar Bush, which was originally published in 1970. For anyone who doesn’t know, he’s the guy who basically founded the National Science Foundation. This book is his account of working as the architect and administrator of an R&D pipeline that efficiently coordinated the work of civilian scientists and the military during World War II. He was central to catalyzing the development of radar and the proximity fuse, the mass production of penicillin and the initiation of the Manhattan Project. You can find out more about Stripe Press, the books we publish, the movies we produce, and yes, even the other episodes of this podcast at press.stripe.com. The senior producers for season one up Beneath the Surface are myself and Everett Katigbak. This episode was produced by Jack Rossiter-Munley. Whitney Chen was our production manager. Original music for Beneath the Surface was composed by Auribus. Our sound mixer and sound designer was Jim McKee. That’s it for this episode. I’ve been your host, Tamara Winter. This is Beneath the Surface.

Title: Powering 2026: The Strategic Shift to Domestic Uranium Security
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/20/3222171/0/en/Powering-2026-The-Strategic-Shift-to-Domestic-Uranium-Security.html

January 20, 2026 13:11 ET | Source: USA News Group USA News Group VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 20, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USANewsGroup.com News Commentary – As we enter 2026, the global uranium sector appears to be hitting a considerable supply wall[1]. With U.S. domestic production languishing at 90% below annual requirements[2], the push for North American fuel independence seems to have shifted from a political goal to a critical market priority. This structural supply-demand mismatch comes at a time when activity in the sector is picking up and positioning several key players as potentially essential infrastructure platforms, including Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), NexGen Energy (NYSE: NXE) (TSX: NXE), Gladiator Metals (TSXV: GLAD) (OTCQB: GDTRF), Premier American Uranium (TSXV: PUR) (OTCQB: PAUIF), and Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSE-A: UEC). The primary catalyst is a significant increase in digital power; data center capacity is projected to triple by 2030 as AI workloads redefine the global grid[3]. Consequently, the Western world appears locked in a strategic race to secure domestic critical minerals[4], moving past simple exploration and into the high-stakes build-out of uranium and copper supplies in jurisdictions that prioritize geopolitical security. Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) recently announced a pending merger with uranium miner Eagle Energy Metals, a next-generation nuclear energy company with the largest mineable, measured and indicted U.S. uranium deposit. Following the announcement, Eagle Energy Metals announced that it has engaged BBA USA Inc., a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because following the SPAC merger, the company is heading toward a NASDAQ listing, subject to customary closing conditions, under the ticker symbol NUCL. Notably, the team orchestrating this transaction is the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022. Eagle Energy Metals holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data. "We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.," said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. "Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten." The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan. President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and seeking to quadruple U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply. Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy, while Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear. Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds rights to exclusive Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized. NexGen Energy (NYSE: NXE) (TSX: NXE) announced its highest-grade assay results to date at the 100%-owned Patterson Corridor East (PCE) with drill hole RK-25-256 returning 5.5 meters at 21.4% U₃O₈ between 590.0 and 595.5 meter depth, including 2.5 meters at 46.1% U₃O₈ and 0.5 meters at 74.8% U₃O₈. The high-grade uranium intersection is reportedly 119 meters down-dip of drill hole RK-25-232 and an additional 51 meters down-dip of recently reported RK-25-254, with intense high-grade uranium mineralization currently interpreted along a minimum of 215 meters of dip extent. "RK-25-256 high-grade assay results, consisting of ultra-high grade 0.5 m 74.8% U₃O₈ takes PCE into a rare mineralized category on a world scale for uranium deposits," said Leigh Curyer, Founder and CEO of NexGen Energy. "This type of basement-hosted mineralization is synonymous with Arrow, only 3.5 km to the west." NexGen indicated that it is developing a uranium project portfolio focused on multi-generational nuclear fuel supply, with Arrow as the inaugural deposit. The company controls the most prospective portfolio of over 190,000 hectares across 140 kilometers of the southwest Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. Gladiator Metals (TSXV: GLAD) (OTCQB: GDTRF) announced a significant new discovery at its Whitehorse Copper Belt property in Yukon, with maiden drilling at Cub East intersecting 27 meters of 2.56% copper and 1.44 grams per tonne gold within 44.2 meters of 1.69% copper and 0.93 g/t gold. The five-hole program confirmed high-grade copper-gold-magnetite skarn mineralization over 300 meters of strike length, with all holes intersecting significant grades adjacent to the historic Black Cub South pit. "Gladiator's maiden drilling campaign on the newly identified geophysical target at Cub East has delivered exceptional high-grade results and a major new discovery, fully validating the company's innovative exploration strategy," said Jason Bontempo, CEO of Gladiator Metals. "All five drillholes intersected previously unknown zones of high-grade copper-gold-magnetite skarn, confirming robust continuity across more than 350 meters of strike and 300 meters down-dip." The discovery was identified through combined gravity and Induced Polarization surveys beneath shallow cover, with mineralization remaining open in all directions. Gladiator Metals says it is fully funded to execute over 50,000 meters of additional diamond drilling in 2026 targeting high-grade copper skarns throughout the Whitehorse Copper Belt. Premier American Uranium (TSXV: PUR) (OTCQB: PAUIF) announced that it filed a technical report containing its Preliminary Economic Assessment and updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Cebolleta Uranium Project in New Mexico, outlining the potential for a low-CAPEX, long-life uranium operation with strong baseline economics. The company indicated that the PEA demonstrates an after-tax net present value of US$83.9 million at an 8% discount rate, with average annual production of approximately 1.4 million pounds U₃O₈ over a 13-year mine life and total production of 18.1 million pounds. According to the company, the project features direct capital expenditures of US$64.2 million and average operating costs of US$41.60 per pound U₃O₈ recovered, with heap leach processing costs of US$16.72 per short ton. The updated Mineral Resource Estimate includes indicated resources of 20.3 million pounds eU₃O₈ grading 0.12%, representing a 9% increase compared to the 2024 technical report, with significant upside potential through improved metallurgical recoveries that could increase the base case after-tax NPV by approximately 90% to US$159 million at 90% recovery assumptions. Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSE-A: UEC) reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, achieving a Total Cost per Pound of $34.35 based on production of 68,612 pounds of precipitated uranium and dried and drummed U₃O₈ for the quarter. The company announced that it completed major construction milestones at Burke Hollow setting the stage for initial operations at South Texas's newest in-situ recovery production facility, while advancing six additional header houses at Christensen Ranch in Wyoming's Powder River Basin and completing a full refurbishment of the yellowcake thickener and calciner at the Irigaray Central Processing Plant. "This quarter represented a step change for UEC," said Amir Adnani, President and CEO of Uranium Energy. "With the launch of United States Uranium Refining & Conversion Corp, we added a new business line that positions the Company to become the only U.S. supplier with both uranium and UF₆ production capabilities." Uranium Energy has stated that it maintains a strong balance sheet with $698 million of cash, uranium inventory and equities at market prices with no debt, and holds 1,356,000 pounds of U₃O₈ in inventory. The company's workforce has grown to 84 personnel in Wyoming and 86 in South Texas supporting expanding operations.

European shares were hit by the continuing uncertainty caused by Us president Donald Trump’s tariff threats over his desire to “acquire” Greenland. The tensions have dented sentiment amid a positive start to the year, with investors believing Europe is vulnerable to higher tariffs, but that ⁠defence and infrastructure spending could soften the blow on the markets. The Iseq All-Share index underperformed against regional comparators on Tuesday, falling 0.89 per cent to 12,872.65. Insurance group FBD Holdings Plc topped the index, gaining 2.51 per cent to reach €16.35. That positive movement was not enough to keep the index out of the red, as a series of major components fell. In the news, Ryanair fell 1.18 per cent to €28.49 amid an ongoing saga between chief executive Michael O’Leary and Tesla owner Elon Musk. Mr Musk held a poll on whether he should purchase the company and oust its chief executive. Insulation and building materials specialist Kingspan Group dropped 2.05 per cent to a share price of €69.35. The company was joined in the red by bankers AIB and Bank of Ireland, which each fell 0.69 per cent on the day. The UK’s FTSE 100 logged its steepest one-day fall in close to ‍two weeks on Tuesday amid rising trade uncertainty. The blue-chip index closed down 0.72 per cent. In ⁠London, pharmaceutical stocks fell 1.6 per cent. AstraZeneca fell 2.6 per cent, after the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said it would delist its American Depositary Shares and debt securities from Nasdaq. Conversely, precious metals miners rose 1.8 per cent, as gold vaulted past $4,700 an ounce for the first time, while silver hovered near record highs as Trump’s tariff threats sparked a flight to safe-haven assets. Miners have been among the biggest drivers of the FTSE 100’s positive start to 2026, driving it to record highs. European shares touched their lowest in nearly two weeks on Tuesday, as mounting unease over Mr Trump’s tariffs threat ‍over Greenland hurt optimism from earlier in the month. The pan-European STOXX 600 ended 0.7 per cent lower, marking its biggest two-day drop in two months. While some remain sceptical about the extent to which Mr Trump will follow through on his threats, investors ‌are ​on ‍edge as the US president has shown little sign of softening his rhetoric. In company news, French automaker Renault Group’s shares rose 2.2 per cent after it said sales volumes had risen 3.2 per cent in 2025. Oil major TotalEnergies was up 1.4 per cent, as the company said it expects lower oil and liquefied natural gas sales in the fourth quarter of 2025, but stronger margins on refining fuels. Britain’s Wise jumped 16 per cent on robust third-quarter results, while Qiagen gained 12.4 per cent after a report said it is considering strategic options ‌amid fresh interest. Luxury group LVMH shares fell 2.2 per cent. Mr Trump threatened to slap a 200 per cent ‌tariff on French wines and champagne to push French president Emmanuel Macron to join his Board of Peace initiative. Wall Street’s main indexes started the holiday-truncated week on ‍a dour note as investors were spooked by the Greenland-related tariff threats from Mr Trump against Europe. The Nasdaq broke below its 50-day moving average – an important technical threshold – while the S&P 500 hovered at the edge. Critical Metals, which has a ⁠strategic presence in Greenland, slipped 2.7 per cent. Earnings season is also kicking into a higher gear, with several industry bellwethers set to report their quarterly earnings this week. Netflix gained 0.6 per cent after switching to an all-cash offer for Warner Bros Discovery’s studio and streaming assets, without increasing the $82.7 billion bid. The streaming giant, due to report its quarterly ‌earnings after the bell, was the only ‌stock in the mega-cap FAANG group of tech stocks – Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google – to trade in the green. Industrial bellwether 3M tumbled 8.5 per cent after forecasting annual adjusted profit a touch below Wall Street expectations, while Fastenal fell 3.8 per cent after missing fourth-quarter revenue estimates. – Additional reporting Reuters From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

January 20, 2026 12:38 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Jan. 20, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global single-use bioprocessing market reached a valuation of USD 30.12 billion in 2025 and is forecasted to expand to USD 122.92 billion by 2035, achieving a robust CAGR of 15.1% from 2026 to 2035. Today, the Single-Use Bioprocessing (SUB) market has definitively transcended clinical boundaries to become the operational backbone of commercial biomanufacturing. Fueled by an urgent industry mandate for flexible capacity, the sector is witnessing a technological breakthrough, exemplified by Thermo Fisher’s 5,000 L DynaDrive and ABEC’s 6,000 L systems, which now rival stainless-steel throughput. This structural shift is validated by massive capital projects, including Samsung Biologics’ 180,000 L capacity expansion, confirming SUB’s viability for high-volume production. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/single-use-bioprocessing-market Financially, the value proposition is compelling. As per Astute Analytica’s finding, Stakeholders leveraging single-use platforms realize a 40% to 50% reduction in CAPEX and accelerate facility commissioning by nearly 18 months. Operational efficiency is equally transformative in the single-use bioprocessing market, with CDMOs like WuXi Biologics utilizing agile, disposable workflows to manage a USD 20.1 billion backlog while cutting water and energy consumption by 46%. As sustainability becomes a regulatory priority and downstream innovations achieve 17x higher yields, SUB is no longer an alternative but the competitive standard. With the FDA approving 16 single-use-manufactured biologics in 2024 alone, the market is poised for sustained, high-velocity growth, fundamentally redefining the cost structure of global drug delivery. Key Findings in Single-Use Bioprocessing Market By Workflow, Upstream Bioprocessing Dominates By Enabling High Density Perfusion Architectures Upstream bioprocessing commands the lion's share of revenue in single-use bioprocessing market propelled by its pivotal role in enabling high-density perfusion architectures that redefine productivity benchmarks. Traditional fed-batch processes cap cell densities at 20-30 million cells/mL, but perfusion modes—powered by single-use ATF filtration integrated into bioreactor bags—sustain 100+ million cells/mL over 30-60 day campaigns. This eliminates stainless steel's sterilization nightmares: complex piping loops prone to biofilm buildup and validation delays. Disposable assemblies turn the bioreactor into a plug-and-play engine, slashing changeover times from weeks to hours and boosting titers 5-10x. The value proposition skyrockets "value per batch." Reinforced films withstand shear forces and extended runs, justifying premiums of 20-30% over basic bags. With downstream lagging in continuous purification—still bottlenecked by Protein A costs at $14,000/L—upstream captures 55% market share. Investments flood in: Cytiva's XDR platforms and ABEC's ATB™ exemplify scalability to 6,000L, fueling perfusion for bispecifics and cell therapies. North American retrofits amplify this, with Amgen-like hybrids yielding 40% OPEX cuts. Asia Pacific's scale-out farms parallelize perfusion lines, hitting commercial volumes in 12 months. Upstream isn't just dominant; it's the intensification vanguard, locking revenue as biopharma chases yield revolutions amid biosimilar wars. By Product, Simple and Peripheral Elements Capture Value Through The Integration of Sensor Intelligence Dismissed as commoditized, simple and peripheral elements—tubing, connectors, filters—seize 40% revenue of the single-use bioprocessing market via smart integration of PAT sensors, morphing passive plastics into data powerhouses. Pre-welded pH, DO, and biomass probes enable real-time CPP monitoring, sidestepping reusable sensor risks in sterile bags. A basic manifold jumps from $500 to $5,000 with embedded intelligence, compliant with FDA's stringent PAT mandates. Automation surges demand: single-use pinch valves and flow sensors sync with DCS in "ballroom" facilities, digitizing fluid paths for Industry 4.0 precision. This razor-blade evolution absorbs fixed instrumentation budgets, with high-margin kits bundling RFID-tracked assemblies. Failure rates—1-5% from pinholes—drop 60% via overwraps and laser welds, per USP <665>. Sartorius and Millipore lead, offering 20% discounts on sensorized manifolds for ADCs and vectors. Post-pandemic normalization cuts lead times to 8 weeks, but 12.8% CAGR persists, driven by closed GMP imperatives. Vulnerabilities linger—resin shortages inflate filter costs 15%—yet volume reigns: a 2,000L run devours 500+ units. Peripherals transcend simplicity; they're the neural network of bioprocessing, embedding compliance and analytics into disposables for agile, high-velocity operations. By End Use, Biopharmaceutical Manufacturers Lead By Optimizing Asset Utilization Ratios Biopharmaceutical manufacturers dominate the single-use bioprocessing market with 60% share, weaponizing single-use to skyrocket asset utilization from 60% to 95%+. Steel-era downtime—30-40% on CIP/SIP—vanishes as suites become generic shells, with assemblies handling Week 1 vaccines and Week 2 mAbs. This consumes vast consumables: monthly blockbuster sites outpace yearly pilots, fueling baseload demand amid 14% underlying growth post-stockpile burn-off. "Clinical-to-commercial" standardization seals the deal—uniform films/connectors across scales nix tech transfer headaches, locking multi-year contracts. Pfizer and GSK exemplify evolutive facilities: 2-4 day modality switches versus steel's weeks, yielding 30% OPEX savings. CDMOs nibble niches but lack volume heft. Inventory recalibration stabilizes leads at 6 months, unleashing capacity for 300+ mAb pipelines. Risks like $500M writedowns fade as AI optimizes assemblies. Biopharma's scale—24/7 campaigns—ensures leadership, blending flexibility with reliability to command the market's economic core in a multipolar biologics arena. Accelerating Innovation in the Single-Use Bioprocessing Market Through Advanced Reactor Technologies The single-use bioprocessing market is witnessing a technological surge defined by unprecedented bioreactor scales and efficiency.

Such innovations drive demand as they deliver a 190% increase in oxygen mass transfer compared to legacy designs. Competitors match these strides, with ABEC achieving blend times of under 60 seconds in their Custom Single Run systems, which now reach maximum working volumes of 6,000 L. These advancements allow manufacturers to achieve a 41% lower cost per gram using high-volume DynaDrive systems. Furthermore, the sector sees expanded capabilities in mixing and automation. Cytiva introduced the Xcellerex magnetic mixer in 2,000 L and 3,000 L capacities to solve large-scale buffer preparation challenges. Sartorius also strengthened the single-use bioprocessing market by releasing the Biostat STR Generation 3, which supports scalable volumes from 50 L to 2,000 L with native DeltaV automation. High-volume efficiency is crucial, as Thermo Fisher’s 5,000 L workflow demonstrates a 27% reduction in product and packaging waste versus 2,000 L legacy systems. These engineering breakthroughs confirm that single-use technologies can now rival stainless steel in performance. Massive Facility Expansions Highlight the Demand for Single-Use Bioprocessing Capacity Global leaders are aggressively expanding manufacturing footprints to accommodate soaring demand in the single-use bioprocessing market. Samsung Biologics will operationalize Plant 5 by April 2025, adding 180,000 L of capacity to its network. Upon the completion of Bio Campus II, the company’s total capacity will reach a staggering 784,000 L, covering an area of 96,000 m2. Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies is similarly investing USD 1.2 billion in its Holly Springs expansion. The site will house 8 new large-scale bioreactors, each boasting a capacity of 20,000 L, solidifying the shift toward flexible manufacturing. Smaller players and diverse regions are also contributing to this capacity boom. Syngene International operationalized its Unit 3 facility in late 2024, bringing 20 KL of total capacity online through 10 distinct single-use bioreactors. In Europe, CPi Biotech invested USD 11 million (EUR 10 million) to establish a new facility spanning 36,000 sq ft. Such investments underscore the industry's reliance on the single-use bioprocessing market to scale operations rapidly. Operational readiness is faster, with single-use technology capable of reducing facility construction timelines by 18 months compared to traditional builds.

To support this volume, WuXi employs 4,200 scientists dedicated to these complex modalities. Commercial readiness within the CDMO sector is equally impressive. WuXi Biologics completed 16 Process Performance Qualifications in 2024 and has scheduled another 24 for 2025. The company currently holds a service backlog valued at USD 20.1 billion, reflecting sustained long-term demand. Lonza is also expanding its capabilities by adding 2 new bioconjugation suites to its Ibex Dedicate facility. These figures illustrate how CDMOs rely on the flexibility of the single-use bioprocessing market to manage high-mix portfolios. WuXi supports these efforts with a workforce of 12,435 staff globally and maintains a high talent retention rate of 94%. Operational Economics and Efficiency Gains Are Reshaping Manufacturing Cost Structures Financial incentives are accelerating the adoption of the single-use bioprocessing market. Capital expenditure for single-use facilities is typically reduced by 40% to 50% compared to traditional stainless-steel plants. Operational speed is another benefit, as Thermo Fisher’s 5L DynaDrive system increases productivity by 27% compared to glass reactors. Researchers can run 141 experiments annually with these systems versus only 111 with glass, effectively reducing the workflow cycle time to 31 days from 39 days. These efficiency gains translate directly to the bottom line. Technical performance metrics further justify the investment. ABEC’s large-scale bioreactors now support oxygen transfer rates exceeding 45 1/hr, ensuring high cell density growth. Thermo Fisher’s 3,000 L systems offer 12:1 turndown ratios, enhancing economic flexibility for varied batch sizes. Risk mitigation is also monetizable; Cytiva estimates that a single minor leak in a large mixer can cost a manufacturer USD 60,000 to USD 100,000 in lost material. Avoiding such losses through reliable single-use technologies is a key economic proposition for stakeholders in the single-use bioprocessing market. Downstream Market Evolution and Increasing Commercial Scale Adoption Rates The downstream segment of the single-use bioprocessing market is expanding rapidly to match upstream productivity. This sub-sector was valued at USD 1.57 billion in 2024 and is projected to rise to USD 1.79 billion in 2025. Single-use chromatography systems commanded a 35.6% market share in 2024, driven by innovations like Sartorius’s "Sartobind Rapid A Lab." These membrane units offer 17 times higher antibody yields than resin columns and are rated for 100 purification cycles. Repligen further supports this growth by offering lead times of just 8 weeks for its large-scale OPUS pre-packed columns. Broader adoption statistics reveal the dominance of disposable systems. Single-use bioreactor systems held an 81.19% market share within the reactor segment in 2024. Commercial-scale systems ranging from 500 L to 2,000 L accounted for 52.44% of revenue, while the pilot-scale segment is growing at a CAGR of 17.11%. Mammalian cell culture applications dominate with 62.34% of the share, and monoclonal antibody production accounts for 45.21% of usage. Bags and connectors see usage rates exceeding 85% across facilities, confirming the ubiquity of the single-use bioprocessing market. Regulatory Approvals and Commercial Successes Validate Disposable Manufacturing Platforms Regulatory bodies are increasingly endorsing products manufactured via the single-use bioprocessing market. The FDA approved 50 new drugs in 2024, 16 of which were biologics that heavily rely on single-use components. Among these, 13 monoclonal antibodies were approved, serving as a key driver for disposable reactor demand. WuXi Biologics supported 16 commercial manufacturing projects in the first half of 2024 alone. The firm also has 56 late-phase projects preparing for commercialization, indicating a robust pipeline of future approvals.

Investors are using that as an excuse to move into other names in the stock market, but is that really a smart idea today? NVDA stock trades at $180 as of this writing. Shares have been lingering in the $180 range since August. One would expect a lot more action from the supposedly best AI bet. The anemic price action can mostly be traced back to the anxiety investors have about the “AI bubble” potentially bursting this year. Nvidia is an easy target for the bears after all. However, bulls expect the price action to speed up in the coming months through next year. Financials are still healthy, and Wall Street can’t keep underpaying if earnings keep climbing. Could this take NVDA stock above $300 this year, or should you buy Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) instead? AVGO stock has been hotter than Nvidia due to its smaller size and competitiveness in the AI scene. Let’s find out if it can keep that up this year or if you’re better off sticking to NVDA stock. The stock may be trading sideways, but it is actually getting cheaper… fast! The company’s underlying earnings have been climbing quarter after quarter, meaning a flat share price has turned Nvidia into one of the cheapest AI chip stocks you can buy today if you go by the forward price-to-earnings ratio. NVDA stock trades at less than 25 times earnings, despite analysts expecting 62% EPS growth for the next fiscal year. Revenue growth is also expected to be 50.6%. Growth hasn’t fallen off as quickly as the bears would have expected, and AI demand has remained strong with no sign of a slowdown. Management has kept its beat-and-raise cadence. As a result, nothing yet points to any weakness that can drag the stock down substantially from here. Instead, I expect the growth to continue and accelerate in the coming months. NVDA stock should ideally trade at around 35 to 40 times forward earnings. Even that might be too cheap, considering stocks like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) go for 35 times forward earnings with half the sales growth. The biggest predictor of NVDA’s price is its earnings. If we look at EPS, FY 2026 (ending January 2026) is expected to end with Nvidia having $4.7 in EPS. Guidance suggests revenue of around $213.3 billion. 2027 EPS is expected at $7.6, with revenue of $321.2 billion. If NVDA stock trades at 35 times earnings for FY 2027, the stock price can hit $266. I expect it to go even higher if management keeps beating estimates and raises its guidance. The highest EPS estimate puts $9.7 as a possibility for FY 2027, meaning NVDA stock could trade over $300 at just 31 times earnings. It is likely that the premium paid would be even higher if it managed to outperform consensus by such a wide margin. Anyhow, $300 is clearly in the books for Nvidia this year. The stock needs to climb 60% from here to be at $300, which should happen as long as the share price follows EPS growth. I would go further and put $266 as the floor price for 2026. The PE ratio is unlikely to drop below 35 times earnings. I’d argue that AVGO stock gives you a worse deal compared to Nvidia. You’re paying more per dollar of the company’s earnings, even though it has worse growth metrics and a worse long-term outlook. The company does come with an “underdog” story due to custom AI chips plausibly stealing customers from Nvidia, but it’s not going to make a dent in its market share. You’re paying 34 times forward earnings and 17 times forward sales for the stock. Growth is expected to be over 50% for both sales and EPS, but fall to 38% in FY 2027. Keep in mind that the total debt load is over $65 billion, so the enterprise value is also slightly worse. With that in mind, I’d stick to NVDA stock. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Mostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent Criminal Justice Eugene Volokh | 1.20.2026 11:36 AM Brief excerpts from today's concurrence in Ellingburg v. U.S., though the whole opinion is worth a read: I join the Court's opinion in full because it correctly applies our precedent. I write separately to clarify the foundation of that precedent. This Court's 1798 decision in Calder v. Bull established that the Ex Post Facto Clauses forbid only those retroactive laws that impose "punishment" for a "crime." Over the 228 years since Calder, the Court has struggled to articulate what it means for a law to impose punishment for a crime, and thus to be subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses. The Court's more recent precedents have implemented Calder through two multifactor tests that turn largely on whether the legislature labels the law as criminal or civil. But in 1798, "punishment" for a "crime" would have been understood to refer to any coercive penalty for a public wrong. Many laws that are nominally civil today would therefore have been subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses under Calder. I would restore Calder's approach to the Ex Post Facto Clauses…. Calder's understanding secures Ex Post Facto Clause protection in a wide range of contexts involving nominally civil laws. Those contexts include civil proceedings seeking fines for public offenses. See, e.g., Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co. (2016) (describing "civil penalties of up to $37,500 for each day [the challenger] violated the Act"). They include enforcement proceedings brought by administrative agencies. See Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC, 598 U. S. 175, 196 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring) (describing the 20th-century rise of such proceedings). And they include municipal sanctions like speeding tickets. "If one were to commit a minor traffic offense at a time the offense was to be punished by a $25 fine, and the government were to then amend the statute and impose a fine of $1,000,000 dollars, it would be nonsensical to treat that fine as non-punitive simply because the offense was processed civilly." Brief for Professor Beth Colgan as Amicus Curiae. Because all of these offenses impose punishments for public wrongs, Calder would treat them all as subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses.

Title: Six things to know about Germany's job market in 2026

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden Headlines about job cuts, the struggling economy and layoffs sparked by AI are common at the moment. But how is the German job market faring and what can we expect in 2026? Whether you are looking for a job, want to change industries or have your eye on Germany as a place to find new career opportunities, we've rounded up some trends affecting the job market this year. Workers want job security It's fair to say that Germany's labour market hasn't exactly been thriving of late – and unfortunately, this is expected to continue. The number of job vacancies has almost halved since its peak in 2022, and is even lower than pre-Covid times. "What is particularly dramatic is that fewer new jobs are being advertised than ever before," Enzo Weber from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), told German business newspaper Handelsblatt in a report earlier in January. This makes it a difficult market and means that many people are prioritising stable positions rather than giving up a job they don't like to or going freelance. "Employees are looking for reliable conditions," said labour market expert Julius Probst from recruitment portal Stepstone. Jobs that offer security are therefore likely to remain highly competitive in 2026, especially if they come with a decent salary and the opportunity to work flexibly. READ ALSO: Five hard truths foreign jobseekers need to know Remote/flexible working is not as easy When it comes to flexible working, employees may have to take a step back in 2026. The range of remote work options is declining slightly, studies by the job portal Indeed suggest, with employers having the upper hand. According to the latest data, flexible arrangements are only offered in around 14.1 percent of all job advertisements at the moment, with flexible working hours only offered in 19 percent. At the beginning of 2025, the proportion of jobs offering 'home office' options was 14.7 percent, while 20.2 percent of ads mentioned flexible working hours. It may be because more roles where in-person attendance is required are being advertised. These include sectors like construction, health, care and defence, where remote work and flexibility are difficult to implement. The takeaway is: it's not impossible but remote working isn't as accessible. "Working from home is changing from the norm to a negotiable benefit," said Virginia Sondergeld, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. This is a tend seen across the world as many managers have implemented mandatory office attendance following relaxed rules during the pandemic era. READ ALSO: Where most jobs are expected to be cut in 2026 AI is important – but it's not wiping out all jobs in Germany Unless you've been living under a rock, you'll be aware that everyone is talking about generative AI, known as KI (Künstliche Intelligenz) in German. So how is AI affecting the labour market in Germany? Several companies, such as Microsoft and Amazon, which employ people in Germany, have cited AI as the main reason for recent redundancies. But it's not all bad news. "While the number of job ads is declining overall in areas such as marketing, HR and project management, the demand for AI skills in these very professions is exploding," said Sondergeld. Importantly, we're not seeing mass layoffs across the board. A recent study by the IAB found that AI could see 800,000 jobs lost by 2040, but the same study said AI will create around 800,000 new jobs during the same period. The IAB study authors said the technology could even help increase Germany's GDP by 0.8 percentage points annually. Enzo Weber described AI as "the technology of our time that can be used across all areas". He added: "It will take on more and more tasks, but there will be a transformation in the job market, not a collapse.” Meanwhile, economist Julius Probst said jobs that require empathy and interpersonal skills will not be affected. It essentially means an understanding of AI will be important in 2026, but it's not needed everywhere. Career changers are in demand as worker shortage grows If you've been looking to take on new skills or move to a different sector altogether, now is the time. As The Local has reported, Quereinsteiger (career-changers) are in demand. These people enter a new profession without the traditional qualifications and experience from that field. READ ALSO: Why demand for 'career changers' is rising sharply in Germany But that's exactly why they are sought after. HR managers like that they bring their experience and perspectives from other industries. With Germany facing an ever-growing shortage of skilled workers, there are plenty of opportunities out there for those willing to be flexible. Many companies are moving toward skills-based hiring: hiring practices that value practical skills over formal qualifications. "In 2026, for the first time, fewer people will be entering the labour market in Germany than leaving it," said economist Probst. "This is another reason why skills are becoming more important than formal qualifications." International workers are needed Speaking of the labour shortage, 2026 will also see red tape eased in a bid to attract foreigners with in-demand skills to Germany. The new Work and Stay Agency, due to launch this year and be implemented over the coming years, is expected to offer faster procedures, clearer guidance and a single point of contact for people looking to live and work in the country. Billed as a “one-stop government”, it will link visa offices, the Federal Employment Agency and local immigration authorities. The coalition government initiative is a response to Germany’s shifting demographics, as a wave of retirements shrinks the workforce and deepens pressure on the economy and social security system. READ ALSO: The planned changes to immigration and citizenship in Germany in 2026 Wages are rising and becoming more transparent In January, Germany's minimum wage rose by 8.4 percent. "This is having a particular impact in low-wage sectors such as catering and agriculture," said Weber. And even employees who earn more can expect an increase, albeit a small one. "Wages have recently risen by almost five percent. However, the increase will be smaller because the economic situation is difficult and the days of high inflation compensation are over," added Weber. Wage transparency will also be an important issue in 2026. EU member states must implement the EU Pay Transparency Directive into national law by June 7th, 2026. German companies need to catch up. Employers will soon have to tell applicants the starting salary or salary range either in the job ad or before the first interview. Employees can also request information about their individual pay and the average pay for comparable jobs (broken down by gender).

Title: 8 signs the AI bubble may pop in 2026

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The AI industry is ridiculous. All you need is a cursory glance to spot utterly bonkers valuations, bizarre circular funding models, and a dearth of viable products and profitability. You don’t need to be an expert to know there’s something off about an industry built around companies promising to spend trillions while barely making billions. I have no insider information, crystal ball, horoscope, or deep AI-powered analytics of the industry to back up my idea that the AI bubble will burst in 2026. But the signs are all there and it seems awfully likely. Here are just a few of the many red flags. Major tech companies like Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Oracle have all seen their stock prices explode over the past few years as they’ve consolidated their AI efforts, pulled in gargantuan amounts of funding based on AI hype, and announced incredible infrastructure projects that have upset almost every industry, from smartphone production to water management. Nvidia They, in turn, are funding a few select data companies. (How do you think companies like ScaleAI grew so big, so fast?) But as for everyone else, they’re not doing so good. Indeed, if it weren’t for the big tech companies, the US economy would almost certainly be in a recession right now, according to Deutsche Bank research. That might be OK if these companies were developing something genuinely innovative, profitable, and/or showing real potential to deliver on their investments. But the biggest reason for their sky-high valuations is simple: they’re all just investing in each other. When Oracle announced its $300 billion Stargate Project with OpenAI, Nvidia was set to be the major hardware supplier. Nvidia also invested $100 billion of its own in OpenAI, and Nvidia is also a major investor in CoreWeave (another Oracle supplier). CoreWeave works closely with Microsoft, which is itself a major OpenAI investor. Microsoft and Nvidia have also invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, which has done major infrastructure deals with Amazon and Google. The list goes on. And while these enormous investments might have sent company valuations skyward, many of them are based on multi-year plans with estimates for future hardware delivery and assumptions around costs and scalability. For it all to succeed, it’s got to be done before whatever AI bubble there is bursts. In totality, these investments are completely unprecedented, too. By 2030, McKinsey estimates that AI investment could reach almost $7 trillion. For comparison, the entire Manhattan Project cost only $30 billion (adjusted for inflation). Yikes. Nvidia might be making a killing on AI as the seller of GPU-shaped shovels in this proverbial gold rush, but everyone else is struggling. Microsoft has revised AI sales targets due to poor uptake of its paid-for services, and OpenAI has churned through over $150 billion in investment dollars just to make $15 billion or so in revenue in 2025. If OpenAI can’t figure out how to turn a profit with the backing of all its AI friends, with close to a billion active users, and with the most dominant mindshare in the AI chatbot space, who else will? For institutionalized tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—the ones with diversified businesses, long-tail revenue options, and expansive cash stockpiles—this may not be a problem in the short or medium terms. But even major companies can’t burn through money forever. Microsoft and many others have enacted huge layoffs over the past year to help maintain healthier balance sheets, and investors are going to come calling for their returns sooner or later. Smaller AI companies will be affected first, but as we saw with Meta’s disastrously unprofitable endeavors to develop the Metaverse, even massive tech companies can run dry on interest and momentum. What happens then to the trillions in AI investment? From Nvidia’s DGI Spark system to home hackers running large language models on their gaming GPUs, it’s easier than ever to run local AI on your own machine. They aren’t the top models with their trillions of parameters, mind you, but the latest large language models designed for home hardware are becoming increasingly capable. Mark Hachman / IDG OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and others would love a future where you run all your AI services through their cloud platforms that are gated with subscription fees, but the latest local LLMs are capable enough to handle basic text generation, editing, summarizing, and image generation. With the added benefits of improved privacy, security, and response time for local LLMs, more and more individuals and companies are going to pivot this way in the months and years to come. That’s not going to do any favors for AI companies seeking profitability. This one might be more of a meta point on economic bubbles than a specific point for the AI industry, but massive market rallies only tend to last a few years. Yahoo Finance highlights how the dot-com bubble lasted just over two years, the Japanese stock bubble of the 1980s lasted three years, and the big tech-disrupted rally after COVID just under a year. In each of these cases, their respective stock markets saw enormous growth of several hundred percent in just a few years. The AI boom hasn’t quite managed that—it has experienced a gain of around 130 percent over the past three years—but three years is already longer than most of these historic booms. If AI is a bubble that’s going to bust, then it’s almost past due going by historic trends. All the major AI companies have announced their deals and are starting to make them reality. We aren’t going to see new rounds of trillion-dollar deals from even the major tech firms, as even they have limits on the capital they have available to them. But scaling up to these grandiose goals of AI data centers all over the world is proving difficult. After buying up all the GPUs and memory they can, some of these companies are still struggling to bring them online. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in November that the company now had a power problem, meaning it had GPUs that couldn’t physically plug in because it lacked the power to run them. And then you have Elon Musk’s xAI trying to import a power station (no, really) and supersonic jet company Boom Supersonic converting its jet engines into gas generators (no, really!). AI needs power, but power is at a premium. Power stations and their associated grid infrastructures take years or even decades to build. When power supply fails to catch up to their ambitions, it’s going to slam the brakes on expansion. A slowdown like that is the last thing the AI industry needs to keep its hype train rolling. No one likes Grok’s deepfakes and child exploitation images. Fake frames in Nvidia-run games are making gamers feel like they’re not really playing their games. AI-driven memory shortages and associated price spikes for everyday tech products are driving people crazy. Dell Companies are noticing and already pivoting, too. The most stark example so far this year is Dell relaunching its XPS brand at CES 2026. Sure, it’s still a “Copilot+ PC,” but you’d never know it from the marketing. AI is gone from the forefront and back is the focus on longevity, everyday performance, and lightweight design—you know, the things that consumers actually care about. If no one’s even interested in buying AI, how are these companies ever going to make it profitable? That’s not something investors are going to want to see or hear this year. On top of all the internal AI industry factors that could bring about its fall, there’s also global instability that could just as likely to deal a death blow. The US administration’s volatile leadership keeps throwing up (and tearing down) trade barriers. Hardware nationalization and nationalism are driving secular investments rather than global branch-outs. TSMC And as the superpowers keep eyeing up what their neighbors have, there’s the risk of war stalling out the world economy. Just China closing off Taiwan’s access to global markets would be enough to collapse just about everything in the tech sphere. Hopefully nothing like that comes to pass, but the prospect of it is one more Sword of Damocles hanging over the AI industry. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft won’t collapse. OpenAI probably won’t collapse. But the AI hype train of today could be heavily derailed. The smaller and medium AI companies, and all the firms promising agentic revolutions for your business? They’ll be gone. Stock prices will collapse, and global recession could be the medium-term fallout that eventually corrects everything back to some semblance of normalcy. Long term, though, even the companies that remain will have to contend with hardware deprecation that’ll see them scurrying back to Nvidia every 2 to 3 years. Even with all that hardware power, none of these companies are going to reach AGI (or even super-intelligence) with large language models that can’t functionally understand anything. AI is here to stay, but the industry as it is can’t last much longer. The signs are there that 2026 could be the year it all changes—again.

Title: 8 signs the AI bubble may pop in 2026

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The AI industry is ridiculous. All you need is a cursory glance to spot utterly bonkers valuations, bizarre circular funding models, and a dearth of viable products and profitability. You don’t need to be an expert to know there’s something off about an industry built around companies promising to spend trillions while barely making billions. I have no insider information, crystal ball, horoscope, or deep AI-powered analytics of the industry to back up my idea that the AI bubble will burst in 2026. But the signs are all there and it seems awfully likely. Here are just a few of the many red flags. Major tech companies like Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Oracle have all seen their stock prices explode over the past few years as they’ve consolidated their AI efforts, pulled in gargantuan amounts of funding based on AI hype, and announced incredible infrastructure projects that have upset almost every industry, from smartphone production to water management. Nvidia They, in turn, are funding a few select data companies. (How do you think companies like ScaleAI grew so big, so fast?) But as for everyone else, they’re not doing so good. Indeed, if it weren’t for the big tech companies, the US economy would almost certainly be in a recession right now, according to Deutsche Bank research. That might be OK if these companies were developing something genuinely innovative, profitable, and/or showing real potential to deliver on their investments. But the biggest reason for their sky-high valuations is simple: they’re all just investing in each other. When Oracle announced its $300 billion Stargate Project with OpenAI, Nvidia was set to be the major hardware supplier. Nvidia also invested $100 billion of its own in OpenAI, and Nvidia is also a major investor in CoreWeave (another Oracle supplier). CoreWeave works closely with Microsoft, which is itself a major OpenAI investor. Microsoft and Nvidia have also invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, which has done major infrastructure deals with Amazon and Google. The list goes on. And while these enormous investments might have sent company valuations skyward, many of them are based on multi-year plans with estimates for future hardware delivery and assumptions around costs and scalability. For it all to succeed, it’s got to be done before whatever AI bubble there is bursts. In totality, these investments are completely unprecedented, too. By 2030, McKinsey estimates that AI investment could reach almost $7 trillion. For comparison, the entire Manhattan Project cost only $30 billion (adjusted for inflation). Yikes. Nvidia might be making a killing on AI as the seller of GPU-shaped shovels in this proverbial gold rush, but everyone else is struggling. Microsoft has revised AI sales targets due to poor uptake of its paid-for services, and OpenAI has churned through over $150 billion in investment dollars just to make $15 billion or so in revenue in 2025. If OpenAI can’t figure out how to turn a profit with the backing of all its AI friends, with close to a billion active users, and with the most dominant mindshare in the AI chatbot space, who else will? For institutionalized tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—the ones with diversified businesses, long-tail revenue options, and expansive cash stockpiles—this may not be a problem in the short or medium terms. But even major companies can’t burn through money forever. Microsoft and many others have enacted huge layoffs over the past year to help maintain healthier balance sheets, and investors are going to come calling for their returns sooner or later. Smaller AI companies will be affected first, but as we saw with Meta’s disastrously unprofitable endeavors to develop the Metaverse, even massive tech companies can run dry on interest and momentum. What happens then to the trillions in AI investment? From Nvidia’s DGI Spark system to home hackers running large language models on their gaming GPUs, it’s easier than ever to run local AI on your own machine. They aren’t the top models with their trillions of parameters, mind you, but the latest large language models designed for home hardware are becoming increasingly capable. Mark Hachman / IDG OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and others would love a future where you run all your AI services through their cloud platforms that are gated with subscription fees, but the latest local LLMs are capable enough to handle basic text generation, editing, summarizing, and image generation. With the added benefits of improved privacy, security, and response time for local LLMs, more and more individuals and companies are going to pivot this way in the months and years to come. That’s not going to do any favors for AI companies seeking profitability. This one might be more of a meta point on economic bubbles than a specific point for the AI industry, but massive market rallies only tend to last a few years. Yahoo Finance highlights how the dot-com bubble lasted just over two years, the Japanese stock bubble of the 1980s lasted three years, and the big tech-disrupted rally after COVID just under a year. In each of these cases, their respective stock markets saw enormous growth of several hundred percent in just a few years.

Stock futures are sinking Tuesday morning amid rising geopolitical concerns; President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs on a number of European countries unless the U.S. is allowed to acquire Greenland; gold and silver prices are surging to new record highs as investors turn to safe-haven assets; tech stocks are under pressure amid the volatiity; and Netflix's latest quarterly results are due after the closing bell as the company sweetens its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery. Here's what you need to know today. Stocks are tumbling after President Trump over the weekend threatened new tariffs on several European countries if the U.S. isn't allowed to acquire Greenland. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and tech-heavy Nasdaq were recently down 1.2%, 1.4%, and 1.7%, respectively. The major indexes posted modest losses last week amid concerns that Federal Reserve independence could be compromised. Gold futures were up 3% at $4,730 an ounce recently, a new all-time high, while silver futures surged nearly 8% to $95.30 an ounce, also a record, as investors turned to safe havens. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 4.29%, up from its previous close of 4.23% and at its highest level since early September. Bitcoin was just above $91,000, down from a weekend high of above $95,000 and on track to decline for a sixth straight day as its early-year rally stalls. Financial markets are volatile this morning after President Trump said that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will each face a 10% tariff at the start of February that will increase to 25% on June 1 if the U.S. is not allowed to purchase Greenland. The Trump administration in recent weeks has stepped up its interest in acquiring Greenland, saying it aims to do so with money or with military force. Early Tuesday, Trump posted fake images of himself, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President J.D. Vance putting an American flag in the ground next to a sign calling Greenland U.S. territory, along with a photoshopped map showing Canada with an American flag on it. Gold is leading another safe-haven-asset rally, hitting a record of nearly $4,740 an ounce earlier this morning. Silver is also adding to its gains to start the year, setting its own record high just above $95 an ounce. Gold and other precious metals typically increase in value when investors are uncertain of the economy or the state of geopolitics and therefore less likely to invest in more-volatile assets such as stocks or cryptocurrency. The precious metals have already been gaining steadily this year amid concerns over the independence of the Federal Reserve. Gold futures have risen 70% over the past 12 months, while silver has surged about 200%. All seven of the Magnificent Seven stocks are losing ground this morning amid the larger market sell-off that is hitting tech stocks particularly hard. Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) are all down between 1% and 3% in premarket trading. Chipmaker stocks including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) are also down sharply. Tech stocks have powered much of the market's growth in recent years amid the AI boom, making the stocks also vulnerable to being hit hard when there is a broad sell-off like the one happening today. Netflix (NFLX) stock has resisted the sell-off so far this morning, as investors await the streaming giant's latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell and digest news that the company is now offering all cash to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Netflix executives will likely face questions from analysts during the earnings call about the pending acquisition, on topics including regulatory hurdles, competition from Paramount Skydance (PSKY), how the deal will be financed, and the timeline for when the deal could be completed. Netflix is expected to report that revenue rose 17% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while earnings per share are projected 30% higher, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Netflix shares were up about 1% ahead of Monday's opening bell.

Chips, models, hash rates, capital raises. That framing is already outdated. At this stage of the cycle, growth is no longer decided by demand or funding. It is decided by power. Not theoretical power. Not future contracts. Existing, usable electricity that can support a continuous load. That is the asset hyperscalers are quietly competing for, and it is where expansion is actually happening. Companies that already have access to it within live facilities can move. Those that do not are discovering that capital alone does not unlock growth. That framework is what makes Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) worth a closer look, because the company is not approaching this shift from the sidelines. It already operates across four U.S. colocation sites running continuous, power-intensive workloads, with uptime above 95%. Its current fleet of more than 3,100 wholly owned Scrypt mining rigs is live today, spread across diversified data-center load zones, and management has disclosed a funded expansion to more than 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026. This is not a future buildout. The facilities are live, powered, and operating today, with revenue being generated under continuous load. Look at where the biggest buyers are actually adding load. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has concentrated new AI capacity inside existing campuses in places like Iowa and Texas, where power delivery and transmission are already settled. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has done the same in long-established regions such as Virginia and Ohio. These are not speculative locations. They are places where electricity shows up on time and at scale. Expansion is flowing to what already works, while projects tied to future power remain stuck. That is the environment in which Datacentrex operates. It is not waiting on approvals or interconnection. Its sites are already live. Power is flowing, load is running, and revenue is being generated under continuous operation. At this stage of the cycle, the question is not who wants to expand, but who already can. What matters next is how that position is used. Datacentrex is not holding power idle. Today, it is monetized through Scrypt mining. The infrastructure is already paid for, and cash is already coming in. At the same time, the company sits adjacent to a data center and AI market already measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Secured access to live power does not promise outcomes, but it determines who even gets a seat when demand shifts. For now, Datacentrex uses its contracted, energized capacity the way infrastructure businesses usually do: by putting it to work. Datacentrex’s current revenue engine is Scrypt mining, a faster-growing and less saturated corner of crypto infrastructure that has outperformed expectations over the past cycle. Scrypt mining secures networks such as Litecoin and Dogecoin using specialized hardware designed for steady, always-on operation. It is a different market from Bitcoin mining. The field is smaller. Competition is thinner. Scale is not dominated by a handful of megasites, and that helps shape returns. Over the past year, that gap has been visible in operating results. While Bitcoin miners have dealt with rising difficulty, higher capital intensity, and margin pressure following the halving, Scrypt economics have held up better. Company materials show that Scrypt mining delivered stronger realized profitability than SHA-256 mining for much of 2024. And it’s all because of the structure. A clearer way to gauge mining economics is to look at what the networks pay miners. CoinMetrics network data show that total miner revenue on Scrypt networks such as Dogecoin and Litecoin stayed comparatively steady through 2024. Bitcoin miner revenue did not. The halving cut payouts sharply, and margins across the SHA-256 ecosystem tightened. Scrypt mining also allows a single machine to earn rewards from two networks at the same time, most commonly Litecoin and Dogecoin. Power use does not increase, but output does. That feature is known as merged mining. For many operators, merged mining creates a secondary problem. Rewards arrive in more than one cryptocurrency, each with its own liquidity and conversion process. Turning production into usable cash can involve multiple steps, additional timing risk, and unnecessary friction. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) handles this differently. Mining output is consolidated into bitcoin rather than managed across several smaller assets. The result is a simpler cash flow. Fewer conversions. Less exposure to liquidity bottlenecks. Revenue moves from production to cash without detours. That shows up in operating results. Datacentrex has disclosed that its Scrypt operations have been EBITDA positive from the start. Power costs are covered. Sites fund themselves. Expansion is incremental rather than speculative. Source: https://x.com/ElphaPex/status/2003624000581464457 This defines Scrypt's role in the business today. It is not framed as a destination. It is the current workload on energized sites. Cash is generated, infrastructure stays active, and the company retains the option to reallocate capacity over time. In a market where power is scarce, that combination matters. Treasury Strategy: Liquidity First Datacentrex pays attention to how revenue becomes usable capital, not just how it is produced. Scrypt mining generates value across multiple networks. As a result, many operators end up managing several different crypto assets. That complicates cash flow. Conversion timing matters. Liquidity varies. None of that improves mining performance, but it can affect outcomes. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) avoids that problem by consolidating mining proceeds into a single settlement asset. Revenue is realized quickly and cleanly. There is no need to manage multiple small positions or wait for favorable conversion windows. The result is a liquid treasury because operating costs are covered without the need to sell. Capital can be held, deployed, or left idle depending on conditions. Decisions are not dictated by short-term price moves or balance-sheet pressure. That flexibility is the point. The treasury does not try to add returns on its own. It preserves the ability to act when opportunities appear and to sit still when they do not. Execution: Scale, Control, and Cash Discipline Execution at Datacentrex begins with ownership. The company owns its machines and operates directly within third-party colocation facilities directly. There are no leased rigs and no vendor liens embedded in the fleet. Decisions around uptime, expansion, and capital allocation stay simple because nothing lies between the company and its assets. Today, Datacentrex runs more than 3,100 Scrypt ASICs across four U.S. colocation sites. Power is delivered and consumed under continuous load. These facilities are operating now, and utilization is happening in real time. Growth builds from that base. Management has disclosed plans to expand the fleet beyond 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026, adding capacity inside facilities that are already running. Power, cooling, and operating processes are in place. Capital goes toward machines, not construction. The economics are already visible. Datacentrex has said its Scrypt subsidiary, dogehash technologies’ operations have been EBITDA positive from inception. Power costs are covered. Sites carry themselves. Expansion follows cash flow. The company is also carrying cash. Datacentrex has disclosed roughly $45 million on hand, no long-term debt, and full ownership of its operating equipment. It is not forced to raise capital to keep operating or to add capacity. The people involved have been through cycles where that distinction mattered. Members of the board and management have built and run crypto and data infrastructure businesses during periods when power tightened and capital disappeared. They have seen where leverage breaks things first. That experience shows up in how the business is run. Assets are owned outright. Capacity is added where operations already work. Liquidity stays intact. The company is not built to chase scale just to justify fixed costs. Management has been explicit about how it sees the model evolving. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) has pointed to companies such as IREN, Cipher Mining, and TeraWulf as examples of businesses where the market stopped valuing hash rate alone and started valuing who has secured access to power,, balance sheets, and operating flexibility. The asset is not the output. It is the infrastructure underneath it. For investors, execution here is straightforward. The system is operating, and cash is coming in, while capacity can be added without rebuilding the business. Capital, Revenue, and the Size of the Playing Field The scale of what is unfolding in data centers and AI infrastructure is already well defined. J.P. Morgan estimates that U.S. data center capacity could exceed 130 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 20–30 gigawatts today, with total infrastructure and hardware investment required to support that buildout running north of $3 trillion. Power, not demand, is the gating factor. Generation exists. Transmission, interconnection, and delivery do not move at the same speed. J.P. Morgan’s work shows where capacity already exists. U.S.-listed bitcoin miners are operating more than 8.5 gigawatts of energized power, with approvals in place for roughly another 8 gigawatts. These are not plans on paper. The sites are connected, permitted, and already drawing load. Moving from mining to higher value computing is expensive, but the most difficult step is already complete. Electricity is reaching the site. J.P. Morgan estimates that converting existing mining power capacity to HPC applications could cost roughly $10-15 million per megawatt before GPUs, with all-in AI data center costs exceeding $45 million per megawatt once hardware is included. That math explains why expansion across the sector is gravitating toward sites that already work, rather than projects that still need power. This is where Datacentrex fits in. The company is not trying to solve the power problem. It is operating after it. Its business decisions concern how to use existing capacity, not how to secure it. At this point in the cycle, outcomes hinge on where electricity is already being consumed. Other companies to keep a close eye on in the space: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) NVIDIA is the dominant global supplier of GPUs and accelerated computing platforms that underpin artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and modern data centers. Its data center segment has become the company’s primary growth engine, driven by demand for AI training and inference workloads from hyperscalers, sovereign cloud projects, and enterprise customers. NVIDIA’s strength lies not only in hardware, such as its H100 and upcoming Blackwell platforms, but also in its tightly integrated CUDA software ecosystem, networking solutions, and AI development tools.

Chips, models, hash rates, capital raises. That framing is already outdated. At this stage of the cycle, growth is no longer decided by demand or funding. It is decided by power. Not theoretical power. Not future contracts. Existing, usable electricity that can support a continuous load. That is the asset hyperscalers are quietly competing for, and it is where expansion is actually happening. Companies that already have access to it within live facilities can move. Those that do not are discovering that capital alone does not unlock growth. That framework is what makes Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) worth a closer look, because the company is not approaching this shift from the sidelines. It already operates across four U.S. colocation sites running continuous, power-intensive workloads, with uptime above 95%. Its current fleet of more than 3,100 wholly owned Scrypt mining rigs is live today, spread across diversified data-center load zones, and management has disclosed a funded expansion to more than 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026. This is not a future buildout. The facilities are live, powered, and operating today, with revenue being generated under continuous load. Look at where the biggest buyers are actually adding load. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has concentrated new AI capacity inside existing campuses in places like Iowa and Texas, where power delivery and transmission are already settled. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has done the same in long-established regions such as Virginia and Ohio. These are not speculative locations. They are places where electricity shows up on time and at scale. Expansion is flowing to what already works, while projects tied to future power remain stuck. That is the environment in which Datacentrex operates. It is not waiting on approvals or interconnection. Its sites are already live. Power is flowing, load is running, and revenue is being generated under continuous operation. At this stage of the cycle, the question is not who wants to expand, but who already can. What matters next is how that position is used. Datacentrex is not holding power idle. Today, it is monetized through Scrypt mining. The infrastructure is already paid for, and cash is already coming in. At the same time, the company sits adjacent to a data center and AI market already measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Secured access to live power does not promise outcomes, but it determines who even gets a seat when demand shifts. For now, Datacentrex uses its contracted, energized capacity the way infrastructure businesses usually do: by putting it to work. Datacentrex’s current revenue engine is Scrypt mining, a faster-growing and less saturated corner of crypto infrastructure that has outperformed expectations over the past cycle. Scrypt mining secures networks such as Litecoin and Dogecoin using specialized hardware designed for steady, always-on operation. It is a different market from Bitcoin mining. The field is smaller. Competition is thinner. Scale is not dominated by a handful of megasites, and that helps shape returns. Over the past year, that gap has been visible in operating results. While Bitcoin miners have dealt with rising difficulty, higher capital intensity, and margin pressure following the halving, Scrypt economics have held up better. Company materials show that Scrypt mining delivered stronger realized profitability than SHA-256 mining for much of 2024. And it’s all because of the structure. A clearer way to gauge mining economics is to look at what the networks pay miners. CoinMetrics network data show that total miner revenue on Scrypt networks such as Dogecoin and Litecoin stayed comparatively steady through 2024. Bitcoin miner revenue did not. The halving cut payouts sharply, and margins across the SHA-256 ecosystem tightened. Scrypt mining also allows a single machine to earn rewards from two networks at the same time, most commonly Litecoin and Dogecoin. Power use does not increase, but output does. That feature is known as merged mining. For many operators, merged mining creates a secondary problem. Rewards arrive in more than one cryptocurrency, each with its own liquidity and conversion process. Turning production into usable cash can involve multiple steps, additional timing risk, and unnecessary friction. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) handles this differently. Mining output is consolidated into bitcoin rather than managed across several smaller assets. The result is a simpler cash flow. Fewer conversions. Less exposure to liquidity bottlenecks. Revenue moves from production to cash without detours. That shows up in operating results. Datacentrex has disclosed that its Scrypt operations have been EBITDA positive from the start. Power costs are covered. Sites fund themselves. Expansion is incremental rather than speculative. Source: https://x.com/ElphaPex/status/2003624000581464457 This defines Scrypt's role in the business today. It is not framed as a destination. It is the current workload on energized sites. Cash is generated, infrastructure stays active, and the company retains the option to reallocate capacity over time. In a market where power is scarce, that combination matters. Treasury Strategy: Liquidity First Datacentrex pays attention to how revenue becomes usable capital, not just how it is produced. Scrypt mining generates value across multiple networks. As a result, many operators end up managing several different crypto assets. That complicates cash flow. Conversion timing matters. Liquidity varies. None of that improves mining performance, but it can affect outcomes. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) avoids that problem by consolidating mining proceeds into a single settlement asset. Revenue is realized quickly and cleanly. There is no need to manage multiple small positions or wait for favorable conversion windows. The result is a liquid treasury because operating costs are covered without the need to sell. Capital can be held, deployed, or left idle depending on conditions. Decisions are not dictated by short-term price moves or balance-sheet pressure. That flexibility is the point. The treasury does not try to add returns on its own. It preserves the ability to act when opportunities appear and to sit still when they do not. Execution: Scale, Control, and Cash Discipline Execution at Datacentrex begins with ownership. The company owns its machines and operates directly within third-party colocation facilities directly. There are no leased rigs and no vendor liens embedded in the fleet. Decisions around uptime, expansion, and capital allocation stay simple because nothing lies between the company and its assets. Today, Datacentrex runs more than 3,100 Scrypt ASICs across four U.S. colocation sites. Power is delivered and consumed under continuous load. These facilities are operating now, and utilization is happening in real time. Growth builds from that base. Management has disclosed plans to expand the fleet beyond 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026, adding capacity inside facilities that are already running. Power, cooling, and operating processes are in place. Capital goes toward machines, not construction. The economics are already visible. Datacentrex has said its Scrypt subsidiary, dogehash technologies’ operations have been EBITDA positive from inception. Power costs are covered. Sites carry themselves. Expansion follows cash flow. The company is also carrying cash. Datacentrex has disclosed roughly $45 million on hand, no long-term debt, and full ownership of its operating equipment. It is not forced to raise capital to keep operating or to add capacity. The people involved have been through cycles where that distinction mattered. Members of the board and management have built and run crypto and data infrastructure businesses during periods when power tightened and capital disappeared. They have seen where leverage breaks things first. That experience shows up in how the business is run. Assets are owned outright. Capacity is added where operations already work. Liquidity stays intact. The company is not built to chase scale just to justify fixed costs. Management has been explicit about how it sees the model evolving. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) has pointed to companies such as IREN, Cipher Mining, and TeraWulf as examples of businesses where the market stopped valuing hash rate alone and started valuing who has secured access to power,, balance sheets, and operating flexibility. The asset is not the output. It is the infrastructure underneath it. For investors, execution here is straightforward. The system is operating, and cash is coming in, while capacity can be added without rebuilding the business. Capital, Revenue, and the Size of the Playing Field The scale of what is unfolding in data centers and AI infrastructure is already well defined. J.P. Morgan estimates that U.S. data center capacity could exceed 130 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 20–30 gigawatts today, with total infrastructure and hardware investment required to support that buildout running north of $3 trillion. Power, not demand, is the gating factor. Generation exists. Transmission, interconnection, and delivery do not move at the same speed. J.P. Morgan’s work shows where capacity already exists. U.S.-listed bitcoin miners are operating more than 8.5 gigawatts of energized power, with approvals in place for roughly another 8 gigawatts. These are not plans on paper. The sites are connected, permitted, and already drawing load. Moving from mining to higher value computing is expensive, but the most difficult step is already complete. Electricity is reaching the site. J.P. Morgan estimates that converting existing mining power capacity to HPC applications could cost roughly $10-15 million per megawatt before GPUs, with all-in AI data center costs exceeding $45 million per megawatt once hardware is included. That math explains why expansion across the sector is gravitating toward sites that already work, rather than projects that still need power. This is where Datacentrex fits in. The company is not trying to solve the power problem. It is operating after it. Its business decisions concern how to use existing capacity, not how to secure it. At this point in the cycle, outcomes hinge on where electricity is already being consumed.

Title: One Year of Wins: Trump's Top Accomplishments in First Year of 'Golden Age'

President Donald Trump worked at warp speed to “Make America Great Again” in his first year back in office, and the results, on countless fronts, have been bountiful. Trump inherited from former President Joe Biden a country reeling from a wounded economy and porous border policies that led to mass illegal immigration and a globe facing destabilization with the advent of two major wars in the Middle East and Europe under his predecessor. On day one of his administration, January 20, 2025, Trump began to take sweeping action to address issues inherited from the Biden administration with 26 executive orders — a harbinger of the breakneck speed at which he would work to implement the MAGA agenda. In total, the Federal Register shows he signed 228 executive orders throughout the first full year of his second term — and that is without mentioning the transformative legislation he signed into law and highly successful foreign policy initiatives he embarked upon. “President Trump accomplished more in one year than many presidents did in eight. The President delivered on every major campaign promise — securing the border, stopping Biden’s inflation crisis, signing the largest middle-class tax cuts in history, ending woke DEI nonsense, and restoring American strength on the world stage,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Breitbart News on Monday. “Under President Trump’s leadership, America is safer, stronger, and more prosperous than ever before, and the best is yet to come.” Trump implemented his wildly successful tariff policies that produced many positive outcomes without spiking inflation, defying critics who claimed it would, began to heal the American economy, secured the southern border, settled or de-escalated numerous conflicts around the globe through his “peace through strength” foreign policy agenda, secured significant tax relief for Americans through his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, protected America’s youth and women from radical leftist trans ideology, and unleashed his and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda. Trade Deals On “Liberation Day,” April 2, 2025, Trump instituted his worldwide tariff policy, giving the United States tremendous leverage to negotiate trade and pharmaceutical deals, broker peace deals, and drive monumental investment into the United States after policies of his predecessors led U.S.-based manufacturing to flee to foreign countries. In other words, Trump’s tariff strategy has driven many of his second-term accomplishments. Trump came out with forceful reciprocal tariffs, including a 20 percent duty on goods from the European Union (EU), a ten percent tariff on the United Kingdom, a 24 percent rate on Japanese goods, a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam, a 32 percent tariff on Taiwan, and lofty duties on scores of other countries across the planet. The results on the trade deal front in the months that followed were profound, headlined by the historic deal he reached with the EU on July 27. During a joint press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at Trump Turnberry in Scotland, the leaders announced the contours of the deal, which include the EU’s commitment to purchase $750 billion in American energy and to invest $600 billion in America on top of existing investments. Moreover, the EU agreed to pay a 15 percent tariff on goods from Europe to gain access to American markets, and Trump noted that European countries were opening their markets to American goods. Von der Leyen stressed that the deal was about rebalancing the EU’s trade surplus with the United States when asked about the concessions the U.S. would make. “The starting point was an imbalance, a surplus on our side and a deficit on the U.S. side, and we wanted to rebalance the trade relation, and we wanted to do it in a way that trade goes on between the two of us across the Atlantic, because the two biggest economies should have a good trade flow between us,” she said. “I think we hit exactly the point we wanted to find: Rebalance, but enable trade on both sides, which means good jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, means prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, and that was important for us,” she added. Trump called the agreement “the biggest deal ever made.” In 2024 alone, the countries swapped €1.68 trillion, or roughly $1.8 trillion, in goods and services, accounting for nearly 30 percent of global trade and 43 percent of global gross domestic product. The EU deal marks the centerpiece of Trump’s trade progress as a result of tariffs, and followed deals with the United Kingdom, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The trade bloc of these countries alone accounted for 57 percent of global GDP and 40 percent of international trade. Trump has also struck new trade agreements with Malaysia and Cambodia, finalized during his October Southeast Asia trip. Most-Favored-Nations Deals Trump’s tariffs are paying dividends for Americans through the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) deals he has struck with leading pharmaceutical companies, which have drastically reduced drug prices. Trump told Breitbart News outside of Air Force One on August 3 — more than a month before he announced his first deal — that there would be “tremendous” drops in drug prices when asked if he had advice for Republicans ahead of midterm elections in 2026. “We’ll be dropping drug prices. It’ll start over the next two to three months, by 1,200, 1,300, and even 1,400 percent and 500 percent, but not just 50 percent or 25 percent, which normally would be a lot because the rest of the world pays much less for the identical drug,” he continued. “And we’re going to be paying the same thing. We’re going to have a Favored Nations. We will pay as low as the lowest nation in the world.” On September 30, he announced his first agreement with Pfizer, followed by deals with Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, EMD Serono, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi through the end of the year. Trump’s deals are bringing prices down dramatically on a plethora of drugs, and his agreements with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly provide prime examples. Novo Nordisk-produced Ozempic and Wegovy are dropping to $350 per month in the United States, down from $1,000 and $1,350, respectively, while Eli Lilly-made GLP-1 drug Zepbound is falling to $346 per month from $1,086. Trump is now calling on Congress to codify the MFN deals in the “Great Healthcare Plan.” He told Breitbart News on Friday that he gave countries an ultimatum: either agree to MFN prices for America or face tariffs. “We’re doing that by most-favored nations and other nations, whoever pays the lowest in the world, that’s what we’re going to pay. Right now, we’re paying sometimes ten times higher than other nations. So, we have favored nations, that’s been approved. Other nations have, for the most part, agreed to it, and they had no choice. Otherwise, we were going to put tariffs on them,” he said before taking off on Marine One en route to Palm Beach, Florida, for the weekend. Investments In large part thanks to Trump’s tariffs and deregulation, he has attracted massive investment into the United States from countries and companies around the world, including drug companies as part of MFN deals. Trump puts the number at $18 trillion in investment in just one year, while the White House lists $9.6 trillion in investments on its website, with some of the most consequential commitments being: “In four years of Biden, they secured less than $1 trillion of new investment in the United States … In less than one year, I have secured commitments for over $18 trillion from all over the world, the most ever for any country,” he told the Detroit Economic Club on Wednesday. Leverage for Peace The president has also wielded tariffs to secure peace agreements. He described to Fox News in October how his strategy helped yield a ceasefire or de-escalation in most of the conflicts he has settled around the world: “I think we top everybody by a lot with the tariffs and all of that. But, you know, having the ability to deal with trade, having the ability to use tariffs to help me make a point — the tariffs have brought peace to the world. I’m telling you, they brought peace to the world. And not only here, but with so many other deals. You know, I’ve made seven peace deals where countries were in many cases, 30, 31 years, 135, 137 years they’ve been fighting and millions of people being killed. And I brought peace. And I did it through — in not all cases, but probably in at least five of the seven that we’ve done so far, it was through trade. That we’re not going to deal with people that fight. We’re not going to deal, and we’re going to put tariffs on you. We’re not going to let you deal in the United States. We’ll put tariffs on you.” “And without that, without the tariffs — I mean, far more than even the money that we’re taking in, which is trillions of dollars, essentially trillions of dollars,” he continued. “Far much — more importantly, it gives you a tremendous road to peace and the saving of millions of lives, just millions and millions of lives. You look at India and Pakistan. I said, ‘Well, we’re not going to do business with either of you if you don’t — if you don’t put it together.’ These are two nuclear nations that were — seven planes were shot down as you know, and they were really at it. They were going at it, and I said, ‘We’re not going to do any business with you. We’re not going to have anything to do with you. We’re going to put massive tariffs on you, both — in both cases.’ And they said, ‘Well, we got to start talking about this. This is tremendous amounts of money and power we’re dealing with.’” Trump added, “And within 24 hours, I had a peace deal. They made — they stopped. They stopped the fighting. And we can go one after another. You’ve been really nice enough to announce all of the deals, but there have been many deals. And a lot of them — a lot of the settlements were based on trade.” Speaking at the Ford facility in Dearborn, Michigan, last Tuesday, Trump touted that his “economic boom” is underway. The data from a full year in office backs it up. The Atlanta Fed projects the Trump economy grew at 5.3 percent GDP in the fourth quarter — an extremely robust number despite likely being hindered by the 43-day Democrat government shutdown in the fall. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett predicted in November that the Democrat shutdown was costing the United States $15 billion per week and would drop fourth-quarter GDP growth by one percent to 1.5 percent. Based on Hassett’s comments, the highly impressive fourth-quarter projection would presumably be even higher if there were no shutdown. This immense growth comes on the heels of a third quarter in which GDP “rose at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted 4.3 percent annual rate,” as Breitbart News noted. The substantial GDP figures come as Trump has halted Biden-era inflation while overseeing rising wages for workers, giving Americans more buying power with their dollar. Over the last three months, core inflation registered at just 1.6 percent, the president said last week — a welcome reprieve after runaway inflation under Biden at levels unseen since the Jimmy Carter administration in the late 1970s. Per White House data, while Biden’s policies led to a 22 percent increase in car prices, a 37 percent rise in hotel rates, a 32 percent jump in airfare, and a 31 percent increase in gasoline prices, Trump, as of late December, had presided over price decreases across all such categories. Wages under Biden for the typical private-sector worker dwindled $2,919 on average, according to White House data. In contrast, wages climbed $1,048 for the typical private-sector worker in just 11 months under Trump. Blue-collar workers are seeing particularly significant boosts. Factory worker wages were up $1,300, construction worker wages climbed $1,826, and miners’ wages soared by $3,336 from January into December. “For the first time in years, wages are rising much faster than inflation,” Trump said in a December address to the nation. The stock market has repeatedly hit all-time highs under the 47th president. White House data states the S&P reached 37 record highs in 2025, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke records 18 times. On New Year’s Day, Breitbart News Texas’s Bob Price and Randy Clark exclusively reported that “the Trump administration’s border team closed out [2025] with a historically low apprehension rate of less than 109,000 illegal aliens” for the year. The figure, which includes approximately 6,400 apprehensions along the southern border in December, underscores the effectiveness of the Trump administration’s border crackdown after policies of the Biden administration, including catch-and-release, allowed for historic illegal immigration. “Once again, we have a record low number of encounters at the border and the 7th straight month of zero releases. Month after month, we are delivering results that were once thought impossible: the most secure border in history and unmatched enforcement successes,” said Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement released in early December. “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership and the dedication of DHS law enforcement, America’s borders are safer than ever before.” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Breitbart News Texas that in under one year, “President Trump has delivered some of the most historic and consequential achievements in presidential history — and this Administration is just getting started.” “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are making America safe again and putting the American people first,” McLaughlin added. “In record-time we have secured the border, taken the fight to cartels, and arrested thousands upon thousands of criminal illegal aliens.” Border crossings throughout 2025 dropped a staggering 93 percent, and 130,000 feet of temporary barriers were erected, according to the DHS, while the construction of the rest of Trump’s border wall is underway as commissioned through the One Big Beautiful Bill. The DHS removed over 622,000 illegal aliens in 2025 alone. The removals are in addition to 1.9 million illegal aliens who had self-deported as of December. Trump has settled or de-escalated eight conflicts or wars around the globe since returning to office, led by his historic Middle East peace deal to stop the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Hamas’s brutal October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks. The president announced in a Truth Social post on October 8 that Hamas had agreed to his framework for a 20-point peace deal to end the war, including releasing all living and deceased hostages. Within days, the president jetted off to the Middle East to speak at the Knesset in Israel on October 13. Hamas released all 20 remaining living hostages on October 13. As of December 4, the remains of one deceased hostage, Ran Gvili, had not been returned, according to the American Jewish Committee. Trump, along with Arab leaders in the region, participated in a “Peace in the Middle East” signing ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, hours after he spoke at the Knesset. “So together, let us continue in the spirit of cooperation and goodwill that has finally brought us to this incredible, historic breakthrough,” Trump said at a press conference with world leaders following the signing ceremony. “If we do, together we will reach the Middle East’s incredible destiny — a safe and prosperous and beautiful crossroads of culture and commerce, faith in humanity, and geographic center,” he added. “This will be the geographic center of the world.” On December 4, Trump signed another historic peace agreement, brokered by his administration, between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda at the recently renamed Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, DC. The agreement marked the end of three decades of conflict between the two countries. “In this holy season we prepare to celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace, we have come to the U.S. Institute of Peace, to sign a historic agreement that will end one of the longest-running conflicts anywhere in the world, with far more than ten million people killed,” Trump said. “Today, we commit to stopping decades of violence and bloodshed and to begin a new era of harmony and cooperation between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,” he added. “I want to thank the two courageous leaders. They are courageous leaders.” These are just two of many conflicts or wars Trump helped end since returning to office. He has also quelled disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, India and Pakistan, Thailand and Cambodia, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Iran and Israel. A ceasefire to end “The 12 Day War” between Israel and Iran came days after the United States carried out operation “Midnight Hammer” to neutralize Iran’s nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. Trump and his administration also halted what could have been an escalation between Serbia and Kosovo, Turkish media reported. Trump’s foreign policy footprint continued to grow to start 2026, with operation “Absolute Resolve” on January 3, in which the United States captured former Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, without a casualty of U.S. servicemembers or loss of any U.S. equipment. “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition. We don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years,” Trump said in a press conference after the operation. Trump’s efforts on the foreign policy front earned him the Inaugural FIFA Peace Prize in December during the World Cup draw at the Trump-Kennedy Center. Trump shared that the peace prize is “truly one of the great honors of my life,” and “beyond awards … we saved millions and millions of lives.” During his meeting with anti-socialist Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado last week, Machado presented him with her 2025 Nobel Peace Prize “In Gratitude for [his] Extraordinary Leadership in Promoting Peace through Strength, Advancing Diplomacy, and Defending Liberty and Prosperity.” Another shining achievement of Trump’s — and hands down the biggest on the legislative front — was the passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. To date, the bill serves as Trump’s legacy legislation, making permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts and implementing significant tax deductions for tipped and overtime workers, as promised in his 2024 campaign policy proposal. Waiters, bartenders, casino dealers, and other tipped workers can deduct up to $25,000 on their tipped income starting this tax season, while overtime workers can use up to a $12,500 deduction. The House Ways and Means Committee projects that Americans could get $191 billion in net new tax relief this year, with filers potentially seeing an additional $1,000 on their tax refunds coming this spring. “Millions of Americans will see the working families’ tax cuts put more money in their pockets when they file taxes this coming spring. In our tax relief bill, Republicans wasted no time and ensured that we cut taxes on income earned this year. Americans voted to have more money in their wallet, and that’s exactly what President Trump and Republicans delivered,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) said in November. “Tax refunds are a big deal for a lot of American families. It covers home repairs, health care, or summer vacations; all of which became completely unaffordable under Joe Biden. Thanks to the working families tax cuts, more Americans will have greater financial security and ability to provide for their future,” he added. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows a maximum annual tax deduction of $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles that were assembled in the United States, as long as the filer has a modified adjusted gross income of less than $100,000 or less than $200,000 for joint filers. Beyond tax cuts, the law delivers on border security by commissioning the completion of Trump’s border wall, funding mass deportation operations, and establishing the Trump investment accounts for America’s youth, with a $1,000 seed investment from the Treasury for U.S. citizens born from 2025 to 2028. Trump has taken substantial steps throughout his second term to protect women and children from radical left-wing transgender ideology. In February 2025, he signed an executive order to protect women’s sports from male participants. “With this executive order, the war on women’s sports is over,” he said at the signing. As Breitbart News reported: The order contains several measures, the first of which is to re-write federal Title IX education rules to withhold federal funds from schools that allow transgender athletes to play as females. Another aspect of the order would charge the Department of Homeland Security with the task of denying visas to foreign trans athletes who want to enter the U.S. to compete among women. After signing the order, Trump cited the importance of female athletes and their role in the 2028 Olympics, which are scheduled for Los Angeles. He also mentioned the World Cup. “My administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes. We’re just not going to let it happen,” the president said. Several members of the Save Women’s Sports community, including former NCAA swimming champion Riley Gaines, witnessed the signing. Just over a week after he took office in January 2025, Trump signed an executive order to ban “chemical or surgical mutilation” sex-change procedures for minors. “Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,” the order reads. The implementation of Trump and Kennedy’s MAHA agenda is well underway, with the latest moves including the new, inverted food pyramid and the return of whole and two percent milk to America’s schools. The White House unveiled reformed dietary guidelines for Americans on January 7 at a White House press briefing with Kennedy, Food and Drug Administration chief Dr. Marty Makary, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz. The guidelines promote a diet rich in protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy. “Today marks a decisive change in federal nutrition policy made possible by President Trump’s leadership and the work of MAHA moms and public health advocates who demanded reform,” Kennedy said. “These guidelines replace corporate-driven assumptions with common-sense goals and gold-standard scientific integrity. These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation’s food culture and make America healthy again,” he added. Makary said that “a corrupt food pyramid” had been pushed on Americans for decades, focusing on “demonizing natural, healthy saturated fats, telling you not to eat eggs and steak, and ignoring a giant blind spot: refined carbohydrates, added sugars, ultra-processed food.” He added that most children are consuming a diet including “ultra-processed food,” which he called an “epidemic.” “We have 40 percent of our kids now with a chronic disease. It is not their fault. This is something that is the result of bad advice from the government and a medical establishment that for decades peddled research from a flawed 1960s model,” Makary added. Days later, Trump signed the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act to once again make whole and two percent milk available in America’s schools, after they were virtually banned by the Obama-era Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. In early December, Trump ordered a review of the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule in concert with peer nations such as Japan, Denmark, and Germany, which recommend fewer vaccines for children than the U.S. schedule. He directed aligning the U.S. schedule with peer nations if their schedules were deemed superior in the review. While the U.S. has recommended 18 vaccines for children, Denmark recommends ten, Japan 14, and Germany 15. As HHS noted on January 5: After consulting with health ministries of peer nations, considering the assessment’s findings, and reviewing the decision memo presented by National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, and CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, Acting Director O’Neill formally accepted the recommendations and directed the CDC to move forward with implementation. … The assessment reviewed 20 peer, developed nations and found that the U.S. is a global outlier among developed nations in both the number of diseases addressed in its routine childhood vaccination schedule and the total number of recommended doses but does not have higher vaccination rates than such countries. In fact, many peer nations that recommend fewer routine vaccines achieve strong child health outcomes and maintain high vaccination rates through public trust and education rather than mandates. For example, in 2024, the U.S. recommended more childhood vaccines than any peer nation, and more than twice as many doses as some European nations. The updated schedule “Recommends all vaccines for which there is consensus among peer nations.” Trump’s bounty of accomplishments does not end there. As Leavitt noted, he has rooted out Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies from the federal government, and according to Axios, was on track to oversee “the largest one-year drop in murders the nation has ever recorded” as of late December.

Macy's will close two fulfillment centers in Cheshire, Connecticut, eliminating nearly 1,000 jobs by August 2026. The closures are part of a broader corporate strategy to streamline operations and centralize functions. The retailer has been a top-ten employer in Cheshire since 1986, marking a significant economic blow to the community. Local and state agencies are coordinating job fairs and transition resources for displaced workers. The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative.

The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative. In a significant restructuring of its logistics network, the iconic American retailer Macyâs Inc. will shutter two major fulfillment centers in Cheshire, Connecticut, resulting in the permanent elimination of nearly 1,000 jobs. The phased layoffs, set to begin in March and conclude by late August 2026, deliver a severe economic blow to a community where the department store chain has been a cornerstone employer for four decades. This decision underscores the persistent pressures on traditional retail as companies aggressively streamline supply chains to improve profitability in an era dominated by e-commerce and shifting consumer habits. The scope of the Cheshire closure According to official notices filed under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the closures will affect 993 employees at facilities on Knotter Drive and West Johnson Avenue. The job cuts will occur in waves, starting with night operations and talent acquisition personnel on March 14, 2026. Subsequent rounds will impact part-time and full-time weekend and day-shift workers through the spring and summer, with a final group, including maintenance staff, ending employment on Aug. 29, 2026. A small maintenance team will remain until spring 2027 to manage the decommissioning process. Macyâs stated it will offer severance, benefits information and the possibility of transfers to other locations for affected workers. A decades-long community anchor is removed The human and economic impact extends far beyond the corporate balance sheet. Town officials expressed profound disappointment, noting Macyâs has been one of Cheshireâs top ten employers since it opened the fulfillment center in 1986. The town is collaborating with the Northwest Regional Workforce Board and the Connecticut Department of Labor to organize a job fair and provide transition resources for the displaced workforce. The ripple effect is already felt by local businesses, such as nearby restaurants and shops that have relied on Macyâs employees as regular customers for generations. Part of a broader corporate contraction The Cheshire shutdown is not an isolated event. It follows an October 2025 announcement to close a Macyâs distribution center in South Windsor, Connecticut, affecting another 150 jobs, and plans to shutter a fulfillment center in Oklahoma. The company frames these moves as essential components of its âBold New Chapterâ strategy, aimed at modernizing its supply chain, centralizing specific operations like its off-price Backstage business in Columbus, Ohio, and achieving $235 million in cost savings this year. This retrenchment mirrors a longer-term trend for the retailer, which has periodically closed underperforming stores and fulfillment centers over the past decade to adapt to declining mall traffic and intense online competition. The evolution of retail logistics The consolidation of distribution networks reflects a pivotal moment in retail history. For decades, large department stores like Macyâs operated extensive networks of regional fulfillment and distribution centers to stock physical stores efficiently. The rise of e-commerce giants, led by Amazon, revolutionized consumer expectations for delivery speed, forcing traditional retailers to overhaul their logistics models. Many are now moving toward fewer, more automated fulfillment hubs designed for direct-to-consumer shipping, often at the expense of older facilities built for a different era of retail. This transition, while a business necessity, frequently results in workforce reductions in long-established communities. Key elements of the modern retail supply chain shift include: Centralization of operations into high-tech hubs. Increased automation to handle e-commerce volume. A strategic focus on markets with the highest customer density. The closure of redundant or inefficient legacy facilities. Navigating the transition As the layoffs proceed, the focus in Connecticut turns to mitigation. The coordinated response from local and state agencies highlights the critical role of public-private partnerships in addressing large-scale job displacement. The planned job fair and access to retraining programs will be vital for workers whose skills are specialized to warehouse and logistics operations. The outcome in Cheshire will serve as a case study for how regional economies can respond to the ongoing structural changes in the retail and logistics sectors. An enduring challenge for the modern economy The closure of Macyâs Cheshire fulfillment centers is more than a corporate restructuring note; it is a localized manifestation of the relentless evolution of American retail. While Macyâs strategic pivot may bolster its financial resilience in a competitive market, it leaves a profound void in a community that relied on it for stable employment. The event underscores the enduring tension between corporate efficiency and community stability, a challenge that will continue to define the landscape of work and commerce in towns across the country as the digital transformation of the economy marches forward.

An enduring challenge for the modern economy The closure of Macyâs Cheshire fulfillment centers is more than a corporate restructuring note; it is a localized manifestation of the relentless evolution of American retail. While Macyâs strategic pivot may bolster its financial resilience in a competitive market, it leaves a profound void in a community that relied on it for stable employment. The event underscores the enduring tension between corporate efficiency and community stability, a challenge that will continue to define the landscape of work and commerce in towns across the country as the digital transformation of the economy marches forward.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Consolidation in a ‘Hunger Games scenario’ – and a true loss for the industry

Full Content:
Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → It’s January, and (as per…) the social feeds of most media practitioners are awash with predictions of how the industry will pan out in the coming calendar year. Many such missives are indistinguishable from the next, but among the platitudinous musings, last week’s 2026 outlook presentation from Arete Research stood out, complete with signature-style hot takes from the firm’s noted analysts Richard Kramer and Rocco Strauss. The Hunger Games First off, on a compliance note, the below does not constitute investment advice, with the whirlwind January 15 presentation exploring anomalies in the marketplace, all of which are likely to result in a Hunger Games-style scenario over the next 12 months, per the duo. All this takes place within the context of the media industry’s “Big Three” – Google, Meta, and Amazon – all of whom absorbed even more ad spend than earlier expected in 2025. “We are struggling to see from where in the economy we’re finding these incremental pools of spend,” observed Kramer, noting how this results in “Hunger Games competition.” Indeed, fellow presenter Strauss separately outlined his opinion on how the “Hunger Games scenario” will likely play out with media agencies, as holding companies “don’t have much more to give.” Of course, all this happens within the context of the AI arms race – Arete’s Kramer pointed out that the 2026 chapter of this era would see a move from “automation to action” in the rush to launch agentic offerings. He further observed the resulting “spaghetti junction of partnerships” in this rush, as demonstrated by last week’s tie-up between Apple and Google to power the latest version of Siri. “Distribution really wins in tech, and Google here seems to be in the poll position,” observed Kramer. “They have multiple billion-user properties of their own, they have captured end-point distribution with Apple… the Walled Gardens [continue to] play gatekeepers.” A ‘tale of woe’ & consolidation It won’t be news to Digiday readers that many independent ad tech companies listed on public markets had a difficult 2025, with this cohort’s talisman, The Trade Desk, seeing its stock price fall 70%. “It was a tale of woe,” observed Kramer, noting how of the near-dozen companies within this cohort, only Taboola and Zeta Global were in positive territory, with pretty much the entire category underperforming the S&P 500. It’s this downward pressure, including the need for ad tech companies to find new revenue streams and manage the risks of disruption as ad spend on the open web declines, that’s likely to lead to further consolidation within this cohort. Arete’s analyst duo noted that many developments in this sector of the ad industry will hinge on the outcome of Google’s antitrust cases. Of course, independent ad tech can’t bet its collective future on the defenestration of Google Ad Manager, as evidenced by the growth of Amazon’s demand-side platform – a dynamic likely contributing to the precipitous decline in the stock price of other DSPs – with Arete Research predicting consolidation to gather pace. “Many ad tech companies seem to be for sale right now, or looking to huddle together… this is going to accelerate in 2026,” observed Kramer, who later went on to note, “with the open web, shrinking the space for traditional SSP and DSP buying [ad space] at open web is a reducing market.” As to the potential nature of such exits? Strauss referenced speculation that Criteo may be up for sale, noting that entities such as OpenAI, PayPal, and Shopify are likely interested in assets as they seek to expand their revenue streams. Strauss again emphasized that such observations are not investment advice, although he pointed to Amazon as a blueprint for potential new market entrants. “It took Amazon a good four years to build that stuff, to hire the team, to build it, to have a proper data[set] and so on,” he added. The full presentation can be accessed via here. Elsewhere last week, the tragic death of OpenX CEO John Gentry emerged, with the breadth and depth of tributes to him serving as testament to the high regard in which he was held. Insights from the IPA Bellwether Q4 ’25: The EC further pushes to rein-in Google’s ad tech monopoly The European Commission published provisional findings on Google’s ad tech stack, ruling that its wares (primarily AdX and DoubleClick for Publishers) have been dominant for more than a decade, further recommending billions in financial penalties, with a forced divestiture also in prospect. ‘We don’t care if you don’t use our UX anymore’: Yahoo recasts its DSP as a data backbone for the agentic world Yahoo is intentionally making its demand-side platform (DSP) less sticky. “A big reason everyone wants agentic to happen is to make DSPs go away.” — One anonymous source opines on the subtext for the development of AdCP, etc. Ad tech’s Hunger Games are real… Advertising group Dentsu’s push to sell global unit close to collapse The Financial Times reports that private equity groups are turning their noses up at the international arm of the Japanese ad juggernaut. A Google VP explains why ads make sense in AI search but not Gemini — yet With Google’s Gemini surging in popularity, speculation has been bubbling in the ad industry that the app might be on the cusp of introducing ads to capitalize on the moment — and help offset the hefty AI infrastructure costs. Google’s Dany Taylor explains more to BI’s Lara O’Reilly. Google’s agentic commerce plan is here — what marketers must knowGoogle has provided a blueprint for major brands, writes Ad Age’s Asa Hiken, showing them how to connect to its AI commerce ecosystem that attempts to automate everything from shopping to pizza delivery. However, there are challenges for marketers navigating this complex landscape as Google builds its agentic framework parallel to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. McClatchy Media accuses Google in federal court of monopolizing online ad sales It’s that company again. We think you get the idea by now… Agencies blame clients for being so silo’d that the agency doesn’t have clarity on client data, arguably the lifeblood of modern digital marketing. Advertising is coming to ChatGPT, but not fast enough to outrun incumbent platform giants — one in particular. The European Commission is probing the industry’s response to Google’s proposed behavioral remedies.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Netflix Stock to Move After Earnings Tuesday

Netflix is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday, with traders anticipating a big swing in the streaming giant's stock following the results. Options pricing suggests traders expect Netflix (NFLX) stock could move up to 7% in either direction by the end of the week. At the high end, a move of that size from Friday's level at $88 would push the stock up to around $94, recovering some of its recent losses. At the low end, shares could slip below $82, their lowest level in over a year. Netflix shares are down nearly 30% since the company's last quarterly report in October, when an earnings miss due to a surprise tax expense sent the shares tumbling 10% the day after the results. The shares have also been pressured over the last month by worries about the streaming giant's pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which has faced some pushback from politicians and rival bidder Paramount Skydance (PSKY). Netflix executives will likely receive a number of questions about the deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, including how the company plans to pay for the purchase amid reports that it is considering making its offer all-cash rather than a mix of cash and stock. Netflix is expected to report a nearly 17% jump in revenue to $11.97 billion, while earnings per share are expected to gain nearly 30% year-over-year to $0.55, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Goldman Sachs analysts told clients earlier this month that they expect the fourth-quarter report to "reflect a solid end to 2025 as management continues to execute well against its core areas of strategic focus," such as growing user engagement and scaling live sports and gaming offerings, along with Netflix's ad business. However, the analysts said investors' attention could be more focused on questions surrounding the Warner Bros. deal, including regulatory uncertainty, competition from Paramount, and how Netflix's business will operate until the deal potentially closes. Ahead of Tuesday's results, most Wall Street analysts are bullish on Netflix stock. Of the 10 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha, eight consider the stock a "buy," compared to two "hold" ratings. Their average price target of $135 would suggest over 50% upside from its recent level.

Title: California Billionaire Tax: Why Some Billionaires Are Planning Exits

ByNathan Goldman, Contributor. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act has sent shockwaves across the U.S. This act is generally defined by its proposed one-time tax of five percent on California residents’ net worth if they have over $1 billion of wealth. There are clear theoretical arguments to be made for the bill’s passage as it would raise an estimated $100 billion for health care and educational needs. However, recent analysis suggests that design choices and the current wording of the act could have devastating legal and economic consequences, including some billionaires being taxed well beyond the proposed 5% rate. What follows summarizes the current state of the proposed California billionaire tax, the recent criticism of the act and the design choices that may need to be reconsidered before it is potentially put up to a vote. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act was filed by Jim Mangia, president and CEO of St. John’s Community Health, and Suzanne Jimenez, who represents the SEIU-UHW health care union, in October of 2025. The act has since been put forth as formal legislation on Nov. 26, 2025, under the header of Initiative No. 25-0024. The act is currently collecting signatures to appear on the November 2026 election ballot. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act enacts a 5% tax on the wealth of California residents who have accumulated over $1 billion in wealth. The tax is unusual because it is a tax on wealth, rather than income, and the tax would include payments related to unrealized gains. According to Forbes, this act would raise $100 billion from California’s 200 or more billionaires between 2027 and 2031 (assuming no taxpayer migration or successful legal challenges), and these funds would go to replenishing funding for California’s Medicaid and childhood education program. According to the bill, taxpayers’ wealth will be defined by “personal property and wealth, including shares of capital stock, bonds, or other evidences of indebtedness, and any legal or equitable interest therein.” Thus, the bill is taking the stance that all assets shall be considered when determining whether a taxpayer is a billionaire and subject to the wealth tax. The bill does allow a phase-in that will subject the taxpayer to the 5% tax fully once their wealth reaches $1.1 billion. Only a small amount of assets (up to $5 million) can be excluded from the taxpayer’s net worth when calculating their billionaire status and wealth tax liability owed. Even though the bill will not be voted on until November, the initiative proposes a retroactive effective date of Jan. 1, 2026, a feature likely to face legal challenge. As it is currently written, this retroactive application would subject California billionaires to the 5% wealth tax immediately. The proposal has already prompted significant responses among California billionaires. According to The New York Times, Peter Thiel and Larry Page have openly discussed leaving California due to this tax. Furthermore, Fox Business reports that real estate broker Julian Johnston is working directly with three billionaires about moving from California to South Florida due to this billionaire wealth tax. California already imposes the highest and most progressive income tax rate in the U.S., with a top marginal tax rate of 13.3% on income over $1 million. This billionaire wealth tax would represent an incremental tax on high-net-worth taxpayers in addition to the already high taxes that they pay, leading to possible perceived inequity over this tax. However, not all California billionaires are opposed to this plan. According to CNBC, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang has said that the additional taxes owed (a reported $7.75 billion) is “perfectly fine” with him. While this news is promising, it needs to be taken with caution for two reasons. First, even if some California billionaires pay the wealth tax, if a significant number do not and challenge paying it, California may lose out on those tax revenues both for the wealth tax and in the future. Second, just because a billionaire says they will support this does not mean that they actually will. In fact, just 2½ years ago, Jeff Bezos supported Washington’s proposed billionaire tax. According to the Tax Foundation, he then announced a move to Miami, Florida, shortly before its passage, allowing him to forgo paying any wealth tax and upending the legislation’s potential. Potentially the biggest criticism of this legislation is not from the billionaires themselves, but, instead, from the state’s current governor, Gavin Newsom. According to the Los Angeles Times, Newsom strongly opposes this ballot measure, saying that it is badly drafted and will not end up aiding the essential state services it is geared toward. Given Newsom’s prominent role in both the state and the nationwide Democratic Party, his opposition likely carries a lot of weight among potential voters this November. In theory, funding health care and education needs by asking billionaires to contribute a small percentage of their wealth may seem like a popular and plausible path toward addressing a key problem in California. However, there have already been numerous issues raised with this plan. For instance, Baker Botts highlights issues like the Dormant Commerce Clause lead to a failure of the Complete Auto Test because worldwide assets would be subject to a California tax. This article also highlights numerous legal concerns associated with the retroactive nature of the legislation, the legislation being aimed at single out specific individuals (Bill of Attainder), the Uniformity Clause of the California Constitution, among other things. The Tax Foundation highlights that, as a function of design issues and potential drafting errors, the 5% wealth tax is actually much larger than that. In particular, a billionaire’s valuation is based on voting interests. The article uses Tony Xu, the founder of DoorDash, as an example. Xu owns 2.6% of the company but controls 57.6% of the vote. In this example, Xu has a $2.41 billion net worth based on his ownership in the company. However, as a consequence of the bill as currently written, Xu’s wealth tax consequence would be $4.17 billion, or 173% of his company ownership. The Tax Foundation highlights five other California billionaires whose tax liability would be well over the 5% being advertised, including David Baszucki (Roblox), Sergey Brin (Alphabet), Larry Page (Alphabet), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), and Jensen Huang (Nvidia). This raises questions about whether affected taxpayers would remain in California due to the unusually high wealth tax rate they would be facing. Other considerations raised by the article are that the levying of the tax might force billionaires to sell a large number of their shares (potentially tanking the stock price and causing other financial issues), the assessment rules for private businesses might result in them being overvalued, large penalties for understating liabilities, unusual language defining anti-tax avoidance measures, and a substantial tax that can be assigned to taxpayers that get married or divorced. While the proposed California billionaire tax is still far from a reality, both the potential benefits and consequences have become increasingly apparent. Should billionaires decide to depart California, they will still be liable for paying the wealth tax if the bill is passed. However, whether and under what circumstances this tax is challenged in court, upheld, and collected is a completely different story. Thus, California lawmakers and taxpayers must carefully balance the costs and benefits of attempting to levy such a tax on its 200 billionaires given the uncertainty in the outcomes.

We love iPads, but it’s clear that they’d be so much more versatile if they had multiple ports. Well, this tiny little StayGo Mini USB hub from Twelve South that turns one port into four is just $10. This hub originally sold for $60 (and still sells for that much on Amazon), but somewhere along the line, the price dropped to half. Now, it’s on clearance for a fraction of even the sale price, and that’s absolutely glorious! So, what does the Twelve South StayGo offer? Well, there are four ports — USB-A, HDMI, a headphone audio jack, and USB-C for power. This means you can hook an external 4K display to your iPad, add wired headphones, and charge your gadget at the same time. Oh, and you can transfer some of those photos that occupy your tablet’s storage space. While this Twelve South gadget is uber useful for iPads, it’ll be just as great to use with Macs, too. Considering this product is on clearance, you should hurry and order yours for $10 before the stock runs out.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept. Few are going to miss it. As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices. In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more. Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets. Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI. According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire. And last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well. The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers. Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit. In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending. Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate. That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments. Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers. Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores. “This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.” He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030. Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size. Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity. From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta. For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.) But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more. Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy. As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely. In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior. At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached. These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.” Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!) Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.) With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass. Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.

Title: ASML Stock Can Hit $1,500, According to Pro

Investing ASML holds a virtual monopoly in lithography machines essential for manufacturing advanced AI chips. ASML stock gained 80% over one year and now trades at 44.6 times forward earnings. Memory makers are expanding DRAM capacity aggressively to meet surging 2026 AI demand. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Michael Vi / iStock Editorial via Getty Images The semiconductor stocks have enjoyed another big leg higher to start the year. With unprecedented AI demand and aggressive AI data center builds pushing the fabs to ramp up on capacity expansions, it should be no surprise to see the broader basket of semiconductor names making up for lost time. With the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) surging more than 9% so far in 2026, it certainly feels like the AI trade is back on. And if you’ve rotated out of the names, the feeling of FOMO (fear of missing out) might nudge you to get back into some of the names you may have sold out of in the recent months of relative choppiness. With a memory chip shortage powering the data storage firms higher while the more cyclical semiconductor equipment makers get in on the boom, many may be wondering if it’s too late to act on the latest upswing in the hottest of semiconductor plays. Though the memory makers might be a tad overheated right here, I do see plenty of value in the more cyclical semiconductor equipment makers. Notably, shares of ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) look like a great catch-up trade for investors who want a massive beneficiary without having to pay as high a premium. Of course, the stock has already gone parabolic, gaining about 80% in just the past year. With 17% of the gains coming year to date, though, the shares are seemingly going vertical, as the photolithography machinery (it’s necessary for making the latest and greatest AI chips) orders come in hot. Undoubtedly, demand seems to be off the charts for AI chips, and that’s finding its way down to the equipment makers themselves. With a virtual monopoly over lithography machines, it’s the only game in town for a lot of fabs. And while the past-year run has been magnificent, many analysts see more upside for the firm as the wave of AI looks to lift it significantly higher. The stock might be hot, but it’s not nearly as hot as its peers. Shares are up just over 25% from their 2024 peak, which isn’t exactly bubbly, at least not in my view. In any case, a number of analysts see shares of ASML rising over $1,500 for the year ahead. As foundries look to expand capacity, I do not doubt that ASML could have the potential to surprise to the upside for its coming quarters. But given the steep ups and downs in the semi equipment makers, there is bound to be an upset at some point. I think we’re closer to the start of a boom than the end of one. But at 44.6 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), could investors be pricing in too much of the boom? It’s tough to tell, but the EUV machine makers are the place to be right now. And there’s potential for shares of ASML to lift off in a similar manner as the memory chip makers. Anywhere you look on Wall Street, it’s not too hard to find a bull on the Dutch semi equipment maker, especially as memory makers rush to invest to meet demand for DRAM, which nobody can seem to get enough of in 2026. All considered, I view ASML as a solid semiconductor pick and perhaps one of the more intriguing ones as the semiconductor scene experiences another massive growth spurt. Perhaps there was a reason Michael Burry got out of his bearish bets against the semiconductor industry a few years ago. He was early, perhaps many, many years too early.

Title: Microsoft researchers have revealed the 40 jobs most exposed to AI—and even teachers make the list

Time Published: 2026-01-19T14:41:41Z

Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. As companies like Amazon publicly announce AI-driven workforce reductions, workers are scrambling to understand which careers might soon disappear and be outsourced to technology. A report from Microsoft researchers studying the occupational implications of generative AI offers some clarity. Translators, historians, and writers are among the roles with the highest AI applicability score, meaning the job’s tasks are most closely aligned with AI’s current abilities, according to the report that ranked professions. Customer service and sales representatives—which make up about 5 million jobs in the U.S.—will also have to compete with AI. Overall, the jobs most exposed are ones that involve knowledge work—like people doing computer, math, or administrative work in an office, the researchers wrote. Sales jobs are also high on the list, since they often involve sharing and explaining information. While Microsoft said high applicability doesn’t automatically mean those jobs will necessarily be replaced by AI, the list of roles quickly went viral—with professionals deeming them “most at risk.” It comes as companies like IBM have been freezing thousands of would-be new roles that it expects AI will take over in the next 5 years, and graduates in the U.K. are facing the worst job market since 2018 as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs, said Indeed. Of course, there are some jobs that are unlikely to be touched by AI: Dredge operators; bridge and lock tenders; and water treatment plant and system operators are among the jobs with virtually no generative AI exposure, thanks in part to their hands-on equipment requirements. Still, business leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have said every job will be touched by AI in some way, and so it’s best to embrace it. “Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable,” Huang said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in 2025. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Many of the jobs with high chances of getting upended by AI soon, like political scientists, journalists, and management analysts, are all ones that typically require a four-year degree to land a job. And as the researchers point out, having a degree—which was once considered a surefire path to career advancement—is no longer a safeguard against the changing tides. “In terms of education requirements, we find higher AI applicability for occupations requiring a Bachelor’s degree than occupations with lower requirements,” wrote the researchers, who studied 200,000 real-world conversations of Copilot users and cross-compared the AI’s performance with occupational data. On the flip side, there are some career paths with low AI exposure, that are growing in demand. The health care sector, in particular, is an area that is experiencing this heavily. The home health and personal care aid industry is expected to create among the greatest number of new jobs over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. At the same time, the researchers recognized even their findings don’t capture the full scope of the AI revolution—and there could be further automation caused by more than just generative technology: “Our measurement is purely about LLMs: other applications of AI could certainly affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving.” Kiran Tomlinson, a senior Microsoft researcher, told Fortune the study focused on highlighting where AI might change how work is done, not take away or replace jobs. “Our research shows that AI supports many tasks, particularly those involving research, writing, and communication, but does not indicate it can fully perform any single occupation. As AI adoption accelerates, it’s important that we continue to study and better understand its societal and economic impact,” Tomlinson said. After seeing the rollercoaster of layoffs across the tech industry over the past few years, many Gen Zers have turned to seemingly steadier fields like education. The sector was the fastest-growing industry among recent U.K. graduates last year, and it was similarly a top career choice for American graduates. And while the profession can provide further work-life balance and decent benefits, the ability for AI to do the work may cause further headache. The report singles out farm and home management educators—as well as postsecondary economics, business, and library science teachers—as roles with relatively high AI applicability. While it’s unlikely that schools will roll out AI teachers en masse, the report’s findings underscore how quickly the technology could reshape the education profession—and many others.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Welcome to your complete guide to all the Alexa and Alexa Plus commands you'll need for your life and home, from productivity to games. The newest Echo speakers are a great excuse to brush up on your Alexa commands. Amazon's Alexa voice assistant just had an epic year. Alexa Plus is finally out, offering AI-powered conversational features and advanced capabilities that go way beyond setting timers and playlists. But even if you're happy with your conventional Alexa voice commands, you may not know everything it's capable of, whether on an Echo speaker or your phone. From ordering an Uber to managing your calendar or movie watchlist, we're going over the top ways to use Alexa -- with a complete list of well over 200 options. And if you're worried about privacy, you should know our latest voice assistant survey found that Alexa is the most trusted voice assistant in the US, and you can change settings to help improve anonymity. Now let's get started with the newest commands we like. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include the following: Add in the latest third-party app connections supported specifically by Alexa Plus, and your capabilities greatly expand to some of our favorite interactions yet: Alexa Plus is going to get more of these in-depth interactions, too, with connections to Takrabit, Fandango, Grubhub and more coming soon. Before rolling out Alexa Plus, Amazon announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A few years ago, HR practitioner T. Tara Turk-Haynes hired yoga instructors and meditation gurus to help employees handle burnout at the media company where she worked. She's not doing anything like that today. Wellness perks are no longer "a thing," said Turk-Haynes, now an independent HR consultant in Los Angeles. "Attracting and retaining talent is not a business challenge right now." The white-collar workplace has gotten a lot less cuddly in the past few years, as the economic bargain between employers and employees has been redefined. Perks have vanished, in-office mandates are on the rise, and layoffs continue even as profits hold up — changes that reflect a system that prioritizes shareholder returns over stakeholder capitalism and corporate loyalty. With job openings thinning, wages struggling to keep pace with inflation, and AI looming as a threat to entire occupations, the recalibration is altering how advancement and compensation are determined inside companies — a new reality that some workers view as destabilizing, and others see as a long-overdue reset. "When COVID happened, there was a shift in power from employers to employees with the Great Resignation," said Jessica Kriegel, chief strategy officer at workplace consulting firm Culture Partners in Sacramento, Calif. "The pendulum swung really far. Now it's swinging back." This story is part of Business Insider's series "The Future of Capitalism," which looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth. Earlier this month, Meta began rolling out a new employee evaluation program that ties career advancement and financial rewards to measurable impact, while Citi CEO Jane Fraser issued a memo saying she expects higher performance this year and to see "the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away."

In August, AT&T's John Stankey told managers the company had moved away from a tenure-based "employment deal" toward one "focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment." Meanwhile, some CEOs, particularly those aligned with the Trump administration, have become more outspoken about their political views, suggesting diminished concern about alienating talent. In November, Palantir CEO Alex Karp told analysts on an earnings call that his software company is the first "to be completely anti-woke." The shift toward a more explicitly capitalistic workplace is taking hold even as leaders across the political spectrum are championing increased government involvement in private enterprise. The US, for example, has recently taken equity stakes in about a dozen private companies—an unusual expansion of direct federal ownership in the private sector. Now, even though the economy is relatively healthy, most employers are planning to trim or maintain head count this year, survey data show, while white-collar workers are job-hugging and bracing for more layoffs. "There is pressure on CEOs from investors and shareholders to continue to grow," said Kriegel. "And that pressure is getting pushed down onto employees." The current moment stands apart, though it's not the first time the pendulum has shifted toward employers. The dot-com bust in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 also cooled hiring. Both events, however, coincided with steep stock market declines, whereas the post-pandemic period has been marked by generally strong results on Wall Street. "The stock market's doing well, record-setting, and yet companies are squeezing their employees," said Peter Cappelli, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. The rise of AI has also posed a new existential threat to workers. Many employers see the potential for the technology to replace human talent through automation, and some have cited AI directly or indirectly as a reason for layoffs. "Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI," wrote Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke in an April memo to the company's employees. To be sure, employers' labor costs — typically their largest expense — are on the rise. For one, the average price of employer-sponsored health insurance in the US is expected to increase 6.7% this year, up from 4.5% in 2024, according to consulting firm Mercer. Businesses have also incurred a new expense: AI investments, including chatbot licenses and employee training. Research firm IDC forecasts that US-based firms will spend roughly $320 billion on AI hardware, software, and services this year. Those costs come as corporate leaders are navigating what they describe as a shakier economic environment. Mentions of "economic uncertainty" on US public company earnings calls more than doubled in 2025 compared with the prior year, according to market-intelligence platform AlphaSense. Employment experts say the uncertainty helps explain why the job market has been stuck in a low-hire, low-fire state. Even as large companies such as Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, and Disney announced massive layoffs last year, the overall rate of layoffs and discharges stayed below historical norms, Labor Department data show. The result is a labor market full of contradictions, said Nicole Bachaud, an economist at ZipRecruiter. "That's why it feels so weird," she said. The unemployment rate finished last year at 4.4%, near historic lows. Still, many professionals lack confidence in the job market as career opportunities in once-reliable sectors, such as technology and the federal government, have thinned. "Psychologically, it's damaging," said Lars Schmidt, a recruiting executive in the Washington, D.C., area. In industries where jobs were plentiful, workers generally knew how long it would take to find a new position if they craved change. Now, "most people don't have any safe prediction of what that may be," Schmidt said. Another drag on confidence is the bleak employment outlook. A recent survey of US CEOs by the Yale School of Management shows that nearly two-thirds plan to maintain or reduce head count in 2026. Further, average annual pay increases are forecast to remain flat in 2026, despite continued high inflation and after shrinking in recent years, according to Mercer. These factors may help explain why workers feel economically insecure. Nearly a third of Americans expect their finances to worsen this year, according to a December survey by Bankrate. That is the highest level of pessimism since 2018, when the personal-finance site began asking consumers about their financial outlook. Against that backdrop, workers are increasingly reluctant to quit. The US quit rate has fallen below pre-pandemic norms, federal data show, even as more employers mandate five days in the office and track workers' hours and AI usage. All of this leaves workers with little appetite for pushback, said Jeff LeBlanc, a management lecturer at Bentley University. "You're not going to see a big revolt," he said. "I don't think people have it in them right now." Though the overall job market forecast is gloomy, there are some bright spots for workers. Demand is robust for people who can build out AI applications across industries, said Aditya Challapally, who teaches a course for Stanford Online about generative AI. "This is a small, but rapidly growing niche," he said. AI fluency can help just about anyone get ahead in their career, added Challapally. Workers who understand AI are "able to move faster, make better decisions, and take on higher-leverage work," he said. Hiring is also strong in healthcare, social assistance, and leisure and hospitality, according to recent data from the US Labor Department. Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at job site Indeed, expects the overall labor market to improve as long as the economy continues to grow. "This low-hire, low-fire environment cannot last forever," she said. "At some point, companies will need to start hiring more." In the meantime, some workers are regaining a sense of control by taking on freelance or contract gigs that they could parley into full-time work should they get laid off. Others are starting their own businesses, tapping AI tools to get up and running quickly. Adopting a side hustle is safer than quitting a job and launching a search for a new one right now because the market is just so competitive, said John Ferguson, an HR consultant and former chief human resources officer at NASCAR. "If you don't have the next opportunity lined up, I encourage you to stay where you are," he said. "But also plan your exit strategy." Jump to

Title: Teamsters President Sean O’Brien kicks off reelection campaign

Teamsters President Sean O’Brien kicked off a 2026 reelection bid in Charlestown on Sunday — defending his record, speaking to the future and warning his opponent that Teamsters politics are a “full contact sport.” “We need a full court press going into Las Vegas in June,” said O’Brien to a lively packed crowd of supporters. “We’re going to send a message. Send a message that we are united, and we are ready to fight. And our opponents need to understand, it’s a full contact sport. They need to put the helmets on and buckle the chinstraps. It’s gonna be a long game.” O’Brien, who was elected general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for a five year term in 2022, is running for reelection along with Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman. The incumbents face a challenge from Philadelphia-based head of Teamsters local 623 Richard Hooker Jr., and his “Fearless 2026” slate. Candidates need at least 5% of delegates at a Teamsters convention in June to advance to the November election. O’Brien held his kick-off rally at the Knights of Columbus in Charlestown at noon Sunday, cheered on by a hometown crowd. The president highlighted his accomplishments over his five years in office, including organizing over 90,000 new members — noting he hopes to hit 100,000 by the end of 2026 — securing financial stability for members on strike, making sure no contract can be implemented that members vote down and ensuring rank and file members a seat at bargaining tables. “There is no union that is doing what we’re doing,” O’Brien said. “We negotiated the largest settlement and the largest collective bargaining agreement in the entire country. When people didn’t think we could do it, we got a $30 million deal. We negotiated the strongest contracts in the food service, in the rubbish, in the airline, in every single every single division we represent.” O’Brien also came at Hooker directly, saying “if you listen to him, you think he’s running against Donald Trump, not Sean O’Brien.” Hooker has been a vocal critic of the relationship between Trump and O’Brien, who met privately with the president and spoke at the Republican national convention ahead of his election. “He has not discussed one platform of what he’s going to do to improve this union,” O’Brien said, accusing the challenger of only organizing two contracts. In response to the rally, the Hooker campaign contended the candidate has negotiated five contracts, with two being first time contracts, since being elected in 2020. “Our campaign has explicitly talked about member power and how plan on giving it to them,” the Hooker campaign said. … “One of the campaign platforms is to lower the per capita revenue the international union receives so local unions can survive. With so many layoffs and building closures happening in our ranks, local union will lose resources to fight against employers. Without the resources, local unions will have a difficult time to organize new workers.” O’Brien noted the goal is to make sure the opposition does not even advance to the November ballot. “Of course, why wouldn’t you want to run when the pensions are fixed, when the strike benefit at its highest, when membership continues to grow,” said O’Brien. “F—, that’s pretty easy, isn’t it, to walk in, but we’re not going to look back. We’re going to look forward.” The president spoke to continued “trials and tribulations” ahead of the union, calling Amazon the “largest white collar crime syndicate in the world.” “They’re represented in every single division we represent,” said O’Brien. “They’re our biggest threat. And by us getting the strongest contracts in each in all divisions, we are empowering the non-union to look at what we’re achieving.” The crowd was enthusiastically supportive of O’Brien and Zuckerman Sunday, packing into the event space and cheering loudly. O’Brien called the rally the largest attended union meeting in five years. “We’re going to keep going to every state, every city,” said O’Brien. “Make sure that we’re getting our message out there, make sure we’re talking to members, make sure they’re included and make sure we’re transparent about what our agenda is moving forward for the next five years, and just execute it.”

Title: Fortune 100 companies are back in the office — but 'work from home dark matter' is thriving under the radar

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Remote work is far from dead — it's just learned to live in the shadows. Think of a big-name company, and there's a good chance it's rolled out a return-to-office mandate in the past couple of years. Amazon, AT&T, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Paramount Skydance have adopted a five-day-a-week office mandate, while Microsoft, Intel, and Starbucks have tightened their hybrid policies. As of the second quarter of 2025, a majority of Fortune 100 employees were subject to a full-time office mandate — up from just 5% two years prior — according to Placer.ai, a location intelligence and foot traffic data firm. Over the same period, the average number of required in-office days a week at these companies rose from 2.6 to 3.9, according to real estate consulting firm JLL. However, data reflecting how many US workers are actually in the office tells a different story, said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Bloom said actual work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years. He referred to it as "work-from-home dark matter" — a nod to the invisible material that makes up much of the universe. Like dark matter, remote work appears to be widespread, Bloom said, but may often be procured through special exceptions or flying under the radar.

"We keep hearing endless stories of companies pushing employees to return, but we just don't see much of this in the survey, swipe-card or cellphone tracking data," he said. For companies, the apparent disconnect between rising return-to-office mandates and actual office attendance raises questions about whether employees and managers are complying with RTO policies. For workers, it suggests there may be more opportunities to work from home than they realize.

Fill out this form or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Bloom's research, published on the WFH Research website he co-founded, shows that the share of work-from-home days in the US has held fairly steady over the past two years — fluctuating between roughly 25% and 30%. Bureau of Labor Statistics data backs this up. Bloom pointed to a few potential explanations for why work-from-home rates have remained resilient. One is that while fully remote arrangements have declined sharply since the height of the pandemic, hybrid setups — with employees splitting time between home and the office — have been adopted by many employers. Additionally, Bloom hypothesized that some employees have secured exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. He believes many of these arrangements are "off the record" — granted by individual managers without formal company approval. Bloom said one reason some managers might allow these exceptions is that they're often evaluated based on their team's performance. If a manager is concerned that top employees will quit or become less productive under stricter in-office requirements, they may decide to offer more flexibility. "Managers are allowing employees extra days at home because they are high performers or hard to replace in their jobs," he said, adding, "Managers ultimately care about their team performance." One of these off-the-record exceptions was granted to a Wisconsin-based mother of three who works in a corporate role at a manufacturing company. When her employer announced a five-day-a-week in-office policy in 2023, she worried a two-hour round-trip commute would make it difficult to manage her childcare responsibilities. After an "off-the-record" conversation with her manager, she was told that as long as she came in a few days a week — especially for key in-person meetings — they wouldn't give her any trouble. "If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK," she said. Not every work-from-home exception is off the record. After struggling to make it into the office following day care drop-off, Georg Loewen, a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency, said his manager formally exempted him — for the time being — from the company's three-day-a-week in-office policy. "If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home," said Loewen, who's in his 30s and lives in New Jersey. Loewen said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but that he has consistently felt supported. Bloom said he often hears about West Coast employees who are granted additional work-from-home flexibility because they have regular calls with colleagues in China or India that take place outside standard business hours. He also cited a case in which the head of a department at a Fortune 500 company was allowed to work remotely so his son, who had a health issue, could live near a specialist hospital. The survival of remote work isn't just about individual exceptions. While large employers have made headlines with return-to-office mandates, many smaller businesses and startups have quietly continued to offer flexibility. A report published last year by Flex Index, a platform that tracks flexible work policies, found that as of the third quarter of 2025, businesses with fewer than 500 employees were much more likely to offer flexible arrangements than Fortune 100 companies. And according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about half of US private-sector workers are employed at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Leslie Snipes is among the workers who have benefited from the flexibility of working at a small business. Snipes, a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency with around 15 employees, said her 60- to 90-minute commute through LA traffic quickly took a toll during her first few months on the job. After speaking with her manager, she received formal approval to work almost exclusively remotely. She said she typically goes into the office once or twice a month to "show face" and connect with colleagues. "I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic," said Snipes, who's in her 30s. "It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked." In addition to the explanations mentioned above, lower office attendance may also reflect limited desk availability at some offices. Some employees, however, have simply ignored RTO policies without their managers' approval — a move made easier, in some cases, by geographically distributed teams. Others have turned to "coffee badging," the practice of swiping into the office, grabbing a coffee, and leaving shortly afterward to meet attendance requirements. If a weaker job market persists and companies increasingly use attendance-tracking tools, more workers may be compelled to return to the office. On the flipside, a rebound in the labor market could empower workers to push for greater flexibility. Amid this uncertainty, Bloom said he's confident in the long-term outlook of remote work. "Work from home is here to stay," he said. "But it's mostly hybrid, and it seems it's mostly off-record." Juliana Kaplan contributed to this story. Jump to

Title: What Do Costco Price Tag Codes Really Mean?

If you shop at Costco, you may notice that price tags sometimes look different. Some end in $.99 and others in $.97, for example. Then there's the "death star" asterisk that means low inventory and likely end of run. When you understand the numbers, dates, and symbols, it can help you shop better, save money, and get items not only before they're gone, but at the best price possible. Costco sometimes brings items in seasonally or to test them. Some stay stocked long term while others are only available for a limited time. At Costco, you can't always see something and decide to come back and buy it later. If you love something and it's a good deal, you may want to get it now before it's gone. Knowing the tricks of the trade will help you get the most out of your Costco membership. Many members follow deals posted in local Costco groups on sites like Facebook and by popular content creators. But understanding Costco pricing patterns puts you on another level. The superstore uses the same price codes in both the U.S. and Canada, so if you're from one country and shopping in the other, the same conventions ring true, too. Here's how to decipher Costco's price tag codes. The two numbers that represent cents at the end of a Costco item price have more meaning than you might think. If the price of an item ends in $.99, this means it's being offered at full price. It's still typically a great deal since you're buying in bulk, but it's the original price Costco offers on this item with no additional markdowns, unless you see additional instant savings. If an item is marked with $.97 at the end, this means it's a clearance item or the manager of that location has manually marked it down. This is usually specific to the location, so while you might see this price in your local Costco, a friend who lives in another city may not see it in theirs. It usually means the price isn't going to go any lower, so if it's something you have been eyeing, grab it now. Sometimes, this marking will appear in pen over a crossed-out original price, so it's easy to tell that it's a further markdown. With plenty of Costco electronics worth buying along with lots of other items for smart homeowners, you'll want to take advantage of these $.97 deals. You may occasionally notice product marked in $.00 or $.88. This could mean one of a few things. It could be that the store is running low on inventory for this item, and the manager is clearing out the remaining stock. It could also mean that it's a returned item, it may have damage, be open-box, or it's missing parts. It could also be a discounted floor model. Your best bet in this case is to ask a manager on duty for more specific details. Some items may end in a "9" but have another number before it, like "$12.89" or "$22.59." If you spot one of these, it usually means there is a promotional deal being offered directly from the manufacturer as a test for pricing adjustments and placement. This is typically done for limited sales periods. If it's something like coffee beans or toilet paper that you know you'll use and has a long shelf life, stocking up when you see these deals can save you a lot in the long run. The same goes for some of the best Costco electronics. But you may also want to wait for potential deeper discounts when Costco holds its own manager discounts. Along with different pricing conventions, you might notice symbols on price placards for all types of items, like DIY gadgets at Costco, which have meaning, too. Known as the "death star" for a product, when you see an asterisk, this means the item likely won't be restocked once the current inventory depletes. It's either discontinued, seasonal, or isn't selling well, and it probably won't be returning, at least not for a long time if at all. This could also designate a simple SKU or packaging change, so check with a manager to clarify so you don't miss out. Price signs often have dates underneath the cost as well. This informs the last time the price changed for that item. Based on this date, you can theorize about when the item might go down again in price, or if it seems like something that goes on seasonal sales, for example. Costco rotates deals so if the date is at least a few weeks ago, you might want to wait to see if the item goes on sale again. If there's no asterisk on the tag, this means there's plenty of stock, and chances are, it might drop even lower in price. One other detail to note about Costco price tags is that if it's green, the product is organic. Note that not everything that's organic at Costco will have the green price tag, so you should still read labels. But everything that has a green price tag is organic. Overall, look or the prices that end in $.97 for the best deals. Pricing that ends in $.88 or $.00 are good deals, too, that could be specific to your location. Manufacturer discounts that end in a $.X9 could be decent, but chances are if the item stays, you'll get a better deal down the road. That one's a toss-up judgement call you'll have to make. If you see an asterisk, get the item now, maybe even stock up with more than you need if it isn't perishable because it will likely be gone soon. Following these tips, you can save even more at Costco, won't miss out on the best deals and limited inventory items, and have plenty left over for the always $1.50 hot dog to satiate your hunger after a long shopping session.

Title: Legendary investor Rob Arnott outlines the 2-part strategy that's helped his personal stock portfolio double the S&P 500 over 8 months

Rob Arnott is revered in the investing world for his alternative passive index strategies, but when it comes to his own portfolio, the Research Affiliates founder likes to have a little fun playing the role of hedge-fund manager, too. In an interview on Thursday, Arnott detailed a leveraged long-short strategy that has allowed him to double the returns of the S&P 500 over the last eight months. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of his personal brokerage account showing this strategy having produced a 36.67% return since mid-May. The S&P 500 has returned about 14% in that time. The strategy comes from the idea behind the ETF Arnott launched in September: the RACWI US ETF (RAUS). The fund takes a fundamental approach to indexing, identifying companies with attractive qualities and valuations, and then weighting them by market capitalization. It essentially seeks to correct what Arnott sees as flaws in passive indexes like the S&P 500, which add stocks following periods of outperformance, only to dump them when they've underperformed. RAUS has a 95% overlap with the S&P 500. Seeking to capitalize on this concept outside the index, Arnott had the idea to take long positions on the stocks that his index includes which the S&P 500 does not, and take short positions on stocks that the S&P 500 includes but his index does not. He then amplified those positions with leverage. Every time William publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. "One really fun strategy, and I wish this had occurred to me back in '21, is what if we go long our non-overlap holdings, strip out the whole 95% that's overlapped, just go long our 5% non overlap and let's short the S&P's 5% non overlap," Arnott said, referencing when Research Affiliates launched its Cap-Weighted Index, on which RAUS is based. "Why stop there? Why not go 200% long and 200% short? I did that in my personal portfolio." Arnott could not share the names of individual stocks in his portfolio for compliance reasons. However, in September, he listed Palantir (PLTR), DoorDash (DASH), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as examples of S&P 500 stocks not in RAUS. Examining a list of RAUS's holdings, a few examples of stocks held in RAUS that are not in the S&P 500 include Xerox (XRX), Zoom Communications (ZM), and Rivian Motors (RIVN). "One of my colleagues likes to say, 'Suppose I come to you and I say I've got this great strategy: I'm going to buy stocks when they've just doubled and when they're trading at twice the market multiple, and I'm going to sell stocks when they've just fallen in half and are trading at half the market multiple. Why don't you invest with me?'" Arnott said. "Most people would listen to that and say that's stupid, but that's the way index funds trade." In September, Arnott illustrated this inefficiency in passive index funds with Dillard's Department Store, a repeat constituent of the Russell 1000 index. "In the last quarter century, it has been removed from the index and added back to the index four times," Arnott said at the time. "So buy low, high, low, four times, and every time you're doing enormous damage to your wealth if it's the only stock you're trading." "How big a difference does it make? It's been a member of the Russell 1000 in 22 of the last 35 years. During those 22 years, it has underperformed the Russell index by 99%," he continued. "In the 13 years that it wasn't a member, it gave you 67 times the wealth of the Russell 1000." Jump to

Title: I had 90 days to find a job after getting laid off while on a work visa. A $50 book helped me land my dream role.

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aman Goyal, a 26-year-old associate product manager at T-Mobile. His words have been edited for length and clarity. I was laid off in September, just six months into my role as an AI product manager at an ad tech company. Because I'm from India and was on an F-1 optional practical training (OPT) visa, the layoff triggered an immediate 90-day deadline to either find a new job or leave the US. During my last job search in 2024, while finishing a master's degree in management information systems at Carnegie Mellon University, I submitted hundreds of applications before landing an offer. This time, the tech job market felt even tougher — marked by widespread layoffs, uncertainty around the Trump administration's proposed $100K H-1B salary rule, and intensifying competition for AI-related roles. Despite these challenges, I landed my dream role within 60 days as an agentic AI product manager at T-Mobile. These three things helped me get the job.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After learning I'd been laid off, I took a few days to process the news before diving into my job search. It was a big surprise, as I had recently received a positive performance review. With my visa deadline looming, I knew I couldn't afford to wait long before starting to look. I applied for roles at several top tech companies and a few startups, but the startups that responded weren't willing to sponsor visas. I came across three roles at T-Mobile and applied to all of them. A friend referred me for two of the roles, but I accidentally left his name off the third application. Interestingly, the only role I heard back from was the one I wasn't referred for. The job description was closely aligned with my past experience, and the lack of a referral didn't hurt me. I think referrals have become highly overrated, especially since it seems like almost everyone has one. My referral contact was helpful in another way, though. I asked if he knew who the hiring manager was for the role, and he shared the hiring manager's name. I used the email-finding tool Hunter.io, which offers a free plan with a monthly search limit, to look up the hiring manager's email and sent a short message expressing my interest in the role. I could've asked my referral contact for the hiring manager's email, but not everyone feels comfortable sharing someone else's contact information, so it's helpful to have tools that let you find it yourself. Fortunately, I found the right contact — and shortly after, the hiring manager connected me with the recruiter to schedule interviews.

Landing an interview was only half the battle, and I knew I had to be fully prepared to make the most of the opportunity, so I spent about $50 on "Decode and Conquer," a product management interview preparation guide by Lewis Lin. By emailing the author with my receipt as proof of purchase, I gained access to a Slack community with more than 20,000 members, including aspiring product managers, current PMs, and professionals between jobs like myself. What I found most valuable about the community after I joined was how easily I could schedule mock interviews with other job seekers. Over about six weeks, I completed a few dozen mock interviews — some with senior or staff product managers at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. A few of them were also hiring managers in their current roles, which made their feedback especially valuable. One of the most helpful parts of the mock interviews was that they helped me build confidence and develop the muscle memory to answer questions spontaneously. Doing practice interviews — and also many real-life interviews — also helped me realize that many people focus too much on what they say during interviews and not enough on how they say it. It's essential to pace yourself, keep the interviewer engaged, and be mindful of how you're coming across, especially since attention spans are often short nowadays. Some interviewers prefer concise answers, while others appreciate more detailed responses. You have to read their body language and adjust your responses accordingly. I also learned how important it is to really understand the question before answering — instead of just reciting a rehearsed response. The community also proved valuable for networking. Over about five weeks, I completed six interviews with T-Mobile that covered a range of topics, from product design to system thinking and agentic AI. I felt confident throughout the process. I received an offer in early November, about six weeks after being laid off, and started the role later that month. Today, I'm working on projects closely aligned with my background in AI, and I'm genuinely excited about the direction of my work. One of the biggest pieces of advice I give to the young job seekers I mentor is that even in a tough job market, networking can still work. It may not come through a traditional referral, but in my experience, finding a way to connect directly with the recruiter or hiring manager can be a game changer. Jump to

Title: What to Expect in Markets This Week: Trump Davos Speech, MLK Holiday,
PCE Inflation, Netflix, Intel Earnings

It's a short trading week due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, but there is still plenty happening. Stock and bond markets are closed for the holiday on Monday, the day the World Economic Forum begins in Davos, Switzerland. President Donald Trump is expected to speak on Wednesday in Davos, where he is expected to address housing market reforms and other economic topics. The delayed Personal Consumption Expenditures price index for October and November is scheduled for release, as is the final reading for third-quarter Gross Domestic Product. Netflix and Intel lead the tech firms on this week’s earnings calendar. United Airlines, Johnson & Johnson, Travelers Companies, GE Aerospace, and 3M are also reporting this week. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Housing affordability is expected to be a key topic for Trump during his Wednesday address in Davos. He has announced several housing market reform proposals, including banning large institutional investors from buying homes and instructing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase mortgage bonds to help lower borrowing costs. PCE inflation data for October and November will be released on Thursday as the Bureau of Economic Analysis continues to catch up on reports delayed by last year’s government shutdown. The Fed’s preferred measure of prices follows last week’s Consumer Price Index report showing that inflation continued to cool. Officials will be closely watching the inflation reading ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, with central bankers divided over whether to continue to lower interest rates. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Fed Governor Lisa Cook's challenge to Trump's efforts to fire her. Netflix’s report and commentary, set for Tuesday, could offer additional insight into the streaming giant’s efforts to acquire Warner Brothers Discovery, which could be upgraded to an all-cash offer to match bids from rival Paramount Skydance. Netflix missed on its most recent quarterly earnings due to a tax hit in Brazil. Also reporting is Intel, the stock of which stock has been surging on optimism over its new AI PC chip and significant investments into the company from the U.S. government, Nvidia, and others. GE Aerospace, also slated to report, has seen its stock price near all-time highs after its most recent earnings showed strong demand for commercial and military aviation. Investors will be watching United Airlines’ report after rival Delta Air Lines reported a weaker-than-expected profit outlook, sending shares of airlines lower. Several Dow Jones Industrial Average components are also scheduled this week, including 3M, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Travelers Companies.
