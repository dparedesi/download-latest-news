As Krugman focused on Bitcoin’s wild price swings, Haun steered the conversation toward something else — stablecoins. “Stablecoins are really interesting and really important to this ecosystem to hedge against that volatility,” she argued on stage, explaining how digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar could offer the benefits of blockchain technology without the ups and downs of traditional cryptocurrencies. Krugman dismissed the idea entirely. It wasn’t exactly a turning point in Haun’s career, but it was one moment among others that have helped define it. A former federal prosecutor, Haun brings an unusual background to crypto investing, having spent over a decade investigating financial crimes and creating the government’s first cryptocurrency task force. After becoming the first female partner at Andreessen Horowitz in 2018 and co-leading its crypto funds, she founded Haun Ventures in 2022 with over $1.5 billion in assets under management. Hanging her own shingle hasn’t been without its complexities. Despite her role at a16z and the industry connections that came with it, the two haven’t publicly co-invested in anything since shortly after she launched her fund, and Haun stepped down from Coinbase’s board last year while Marc Andreessen remains a director. When asked Wednesday night at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event about her relationship with Andreessen Horowitz, she downplayed any potential friction while acknowledging they aren’t collaborators exactly. “There’s no ‘gentleman’s agreement,’” she said, echoing this editor’s question about whether there’s any understanding to avoid competing with her former employer. “In fact, I still talk to Andreessen Horowitz. You’re right that we haven’t really done any deals together of late.” The apparent lack of co-investment could reflect the cutthroat industry or the challenges associated with leaving one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent firms to compete directly with former colleagues. Whatever the case, Haun is now charting her own course, and at the heart of it is stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can swing wildly in value, stablecoins like Circle’s USDC or Tether’s USDT are meant to trade at exactly $1, creating a digital representation of traditional currency that can move on blockchain networks. Indeed, fast-forward to today, and Haun’s belief in stablecoins looks increasingly prescient. Stablecoins — which barely existed in 2015 — now represent a quarter of a trillion dollars in value. They’ve become the 14th largest holder of U.S. Treasuries globally. Reportedly, for the first time last year, stablecoin transaction volume exceeded Visa’s. “I think people who looked at stablecoins a few years ago thought, what is the value prop?” Haun said Wednesday night. “You’ve asked me this before. You said, ‘Why do I need stablecoins?’ And I said, “I refer to this as an ‘If it works for me, it works for everyone’ problem.” In reality, for most Americans, the existing financial system works reasonably well. We have Venmo, bank accounts, credit cards. But Haun, drawing on her prosecutor’s understanding of global financial systems, says she has long been aware that the U.S. experience isn’t universal. In countries with unstable currencies or limited banking infrastructure, stablecoins offer something unique, she argues, which is instant access to stable, dollar-denominated value that can be sent anywhere in the world for pennies. “People in Turkey don’t think of Tether as a cryptocurrency,” she said Wednesday, “They think of Tether as money.” The technology has evolved dramatically since those early debates, certainly. Stablecoins once cost $12 to send internationally. And Circle says its USDC stablecoin is fully backed one-to-one by dollars held in JP Morgan bank accounts and audited by Big Four accounting firms. Little wonder the corporate world is taking notice in a big way. Walmart and Amazon are reportedly exploring stablecoins, as are other goliaths like Uber, Apple, and Airbnb. The reason is simple economics. Stablecoins provide a way to move the value of U.S. dollars using cryptocurrency rails instead of traditional banking infrastructure, potentially saving these retail-heavy companies billions in processing fees. But the shift has critics worried about economic chaos. While Circle and Tether are committed to having enough reserves to support their tokens, unlike traditional banks, there’s no insured government protection behind these reserves. Relatedly, if major corporations can issue their own currencies, what happens to monetary policy and banking regulation? The concerns run deeper than just economic disruption. Not all stablecoins are created equal, and many lack the backing and oversight that companies like Circle provide. While well-regulated stablecoins like USDC are backed by actual dollars in U.S. Treasury securities, others operate with less transparency or rely on complex algorithmic mechanisms that have proven vulnerable to collapse. (TerraUSD has had the most specular crash to date, wiping out $60 billion in value when it nosedived.) Corruption concerns in particular came into sharp focus recently when President Donald Trump’s family issued its own stablecoin, a move that highlighted potential conflicts of interest in an industry where political influence can directly impact market value and regulatory outcomes. These concerns came to a head as Congress debated the GENIUS Act, legislation that would create a federal framework for stablecoin regulation. The bill passed the Senate early last week with bipartisan support, with 14 Democrats crossing party lines to support it. It now awaits a House vote before potentially reaching the president’s desk. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, has been particularly vocal in her opposition, calling the legislation a “superhighway for Donald Trump’s corruption.” Her criticism centers on a notable gap in the bill: while it prohibits members of Congress and senior executive branch officials from issuing stablecoin products, it says nothing about their family members. Asked about Warren’s concerns on Wednesday night, Haun practically rolled her eyes. “I think it’s really ironic that Elizabeth Warren or other Democrats who do call this corruption are not running to pass crypto legislation,” she said. “Had there been rules of the road in place [already], there would have been a framework, there would have been clear rules for what’s a security, what’s a commodity, and what are the consumer protections around that.” Haun, whose venture capital firm has made numerous stablecoin investments including Bridge (acquired by Stripe for reportedly 10 times forward revenue), is largely supportive of the legislation, unsurprisingly. But she had one notable criticism when asked what she doesn’t like about it: the bill’s prohibition on yield-bearing stablecoins. “I’m not sure that yield-bearing stablecoins are a good idea for consumers in the U.S., but I’m not sure that a prohibition is a good idea,” she told StrictlyVC attendees. The issue comes down to who profits from the interest earned on stablecoin reserves. Currently, that money goes to companies like Circle and Coinbase. But Haun wonders why consumers shouldn’t get that yield, just like they would with a savings account. “If you had a savings account or checking account and you’re getting yield on that, you’re getting interest,” she explained. “What if you just said, ‘No, the bank gets interest, not you,’ and they’re lending out your money?” Haun was less nuanced when it comes to another Warren concern: that if the GENIUS Act is signed into law, stablecoins could become a vehicle for money laundering and terrorism financing. “Criminals are great beta testers of all technologies,” said Haun. “But this technology is highly traceable, way more traceable than cash. The largest criminal instrument is the dollar bill.” (According to Haun, the Treasury Department has testified that 99.9% of money laundering crimes succeed using traditional bank wires, not cryptocurrency.) Meanwhile, she said, the regulatory clarity that legislation like the GENIUS Act provides could actually make the system safer by distinguishing between legitimate, well-backed stablecoins from more experimental or risky variants. In fact, as the stablecoin ecosystem continues to mature, Haun sees even bigger changes ahead. She envisions a future where all kinds of assets — from money market funds to real estate to private credit — get “tokenized” and made available 24/7 to global markets. “It’s just a digital representation of a physical asset,” she explains. “BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, they’ve already tokenized their money market funds. That’s already happened.” According to Haun, tokenized assets could democratize access to investments in ways similar to how Netflix democratized entertainment. Instead of having to be wealthy enough to meet minimum investment thresholds, someone with $25 and a smartphone could buy fractional ownership in a share of Apple or Amazon, for example. “Just because something’s inevitable doesn’t mean it’s imminent,” Haun said on Wednesday. But she’s confident the transformation is coming, driven by the same forces that made stablecoins successful: they’re faster, cheaper, and, she insists, more accessible than traditional alternatives. Looking back at that 2018 debate with Krugman, Haun’s persistence seems to have paid off. A major question now isn’t whether digital dollars will reshape the financial system but perhaps more importantly, whether regulators can keep pace with the technology while addressing legitimate concerns about corruption, consumer protection, and financial stability. Haun doesn’t seem concerned. While critics point to the fact that stablecoins represent just 2% of global payments, questioning their product-market fit, Haun bats away that concern, too. Instead, she sees this as a familiar tech adoption story — one that has played out repeatedly and often takes longer than people initially imagine. “We think it’s really early days,” she told the crowd.

More impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece examines the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential US economic implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. Vector illustration Beyond the obvious humanitarian tragedy that surrounds any armed conflict, the Israel-Iran war has crucial possible implications for the global economy. With the US striking Iranian nuclear sites, there is a concern that a spreading conflict could impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece will examine the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were some similar concerns to today. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in the week following and took months to recover. By the following year, stocks were over 10% higher. The backdrop was quite different from today, though, with the US in the midst of a recession and the Savings & Loan crisis. To be clear, even though they are luckily in the minority, there are events like World War Two or September 11, where markets are significantly lower a year after the initiation of hostilities. Stock Performance After 29 Major Geopolitical Events Since the start of the current Israel-Iran hostilities on June 13, the S&P 500 has been 1.2% lower. Stocks were little changed last week. The S&P 500 is 2.9% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to 8.7% below its mid-December level. Market Returns Since the war began on June 12, the price of WTI crude oil has increased by 10.1%. Since energy, with oil being a significant part of that mix, is a key fuel for all economic growth, past spikes in oil prices have been associated with economic downturns. On the surface, the increase in prices does not seem extreme enough to collapse economic activity. The price remains well below the 2022 spike on both a nominal and, more importantly, inflation-adjusted basis. Oil Prices Notably, the US and the world have become much more efficient in the utilization of energy. This improved efficiency has translated into a lower proportion of consumer spending allocated to energy, even at the same oil price. In other words, consumers are less negatively affected by oil price increases than in the past. Percent Of Total Spending On Energy To be clear, higher oil prices are still felt by the consumer. One need only think back to the adverse reaction to high gasoline prices in 2022 to prove the point. Furthermore, like tariffs, the higher oil and gasoline prices weigh more heavily on lower-income households than on higher-income households, as they spend a larger percentage of their income on energy. US Retail Gasoline Prices Fracking changed the story of US oil production more than many appreciate. US domestic oil production began to decline in the 1970s and reached its lowest point in 2008. Since then, fracking has led to production surging to all-time highs. US Domestic Crude Oil Production The US has now become the Saudi Arabia of oil! While Saudi Arabia’s share of the global crude oil production has remained reasonably constant at around 12%, the US has increased from providing about 8% of the global oil supply to over 20%. Share Of Global Crude Oil Production In the past, the automatic answer was that the US economy suffered a net loss when oil prices were higher. Consider that without significant domestic production, the US economy was primarily seeing higher prices without benefiting from the oil price increase. With the surge in US production, the increase in oil prices is likely to be neutral for the US economy. This less US economic harm isn’t to imply that a spike in oil prices would be an optimal situation for the economy or markets. Consider higher oil prices as a general reallocation of profits from other industries to the energy sector. This profit reallocation is not typically healthy for overall stock market performance. Economic Impact Of US Oil Production The recent release of US household net worth presents a relatively optimistic picture in aggregate, with net worth only slightly below all-time highs. US Household Net Worth: 1Q 2025 While it is correct for pessimists to point to rising US consumer debt levels since the pandemic lows, the ability of households to handle that debt remains at better-than-pre-pandemic levels. US Household Debt Levels Further to rising consumer debt, credit card debt has also increased, but delinquencies remain below pre-pandemic levels. Credit Card Delinquencies Overall, US households are in a reasonable financial position to withstand an increase in oil prices. Much of the positive story relies on the US labor market remaining resilient. There are signs, as indicated by slowing payroll job growth and rising continuing claims for unemployment benefits, that the job situation is deteriorating. As noted previously, a rise in oil prices disproportionately negatively impacts lower-income households, who are already struggling with the elevated inflation of recent years. As expected, the Federal Reserve made no change to short-term interest rates last week. The meeting continued the trend of the central bank holding steady under “elevated” uncertainty about the economic outlook. The updated median estimates from the Fed still call for two rate cuts this year. Under the surface, the forecast showed a considerable difference in opinions among members, with seven expecting no cuts in 2025 and ten forecasting two or more cuts. To underscore the lack of confidence in the outlooks, Chair Powell said, “No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction.” Markets currently expect two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is little chance of a cut in July. Instead, the first move lower in 2025 is expected in September. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts The betting market priced in slightly higher odds of a recession in 2025 following the beginning of the bombing of Iran. This relatively small increase in recession risk is consistent with the decline in stock prices. Notably, markets currently project a relatively low risk of a US recession, which is consistent with the fundamental health of the US economy and its current resilience to higher oil prices. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession The primary economic risk of the Israel-Iran conflict is the potential threat to oil supplies, which could lead to significantly higher oil prices. Higher oil prices are a headwind to global growth. While higher oil prices are a significant drag on many sectors within the US economy, the profits from US oil production provide a positive offset. Within industries, high energy prices reallocate profits from other sectors to the energy sector. Stocks within the energy sector tend to outperform when oil prices rise and underperform when they fall. S&P 500 Energy Sector Relative Performance Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a significant allocation to energy stocks, which account for approximately 11% of the publicly traded stock portfolio, compared to a little over 3% of the S&P 500. Berkshire controls almost 27% of the outstanding shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which, combined with its Chevron (CVX) position, results in a significant overweight in the energy sector. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Buffett has noted that energy investments are a bet on oil prices over the long term. Based on past geopolitical conflicts, investors should be prepared for pressure on stocks at the start of any widening conflict. While the timing is always unclear, stocks have rebounded as the uncertainty surrounding the events waned. If energy stocks aren’t already part of their diversified portfolio, investors should consider allocating some portion of their portfolio to energy stocks. The energy sector is expected to benefit from rising oil prices, providing some offset to the pressure on other industries.

Furthermore, like tariffs, the higher oil and gasoline prices weigh more heavily on lower-income households than on higher-income households, as they spend a larger percentage of their income on energy. US Retail Gasoline Prices Fracking changed the story of US oil production more than many appreciate. US domestic oil production began to decline in the 1970s and reached its lowest point in 2008. Since then, fracking has led to production surging to all-time highs. US Domestic Crude Oil Production The US has now become the Saudi Arabia of oil! While Saudi Arabia’s share of the global crude oil production has remained reasonably constant at around 12%, the US has increased from providing about 8% of the global oil supply to over 20%. Share Of Global Crude Oil Production In the past, the automatic answer was that the US economy suffered a net loss when oil prices were higher. Consider that without significant domestic production, the US economy was primarily seeing higher prices without benefiting from the oil price increase. With the surge in US production, the increase in oil prices is likely to be neutral for the US economy. This less US economic harm isn’t to imply that a spike in oil prices would be an optimal situation for the economy or markets. Consider higher oil prices as a general reallocation of profits from other industries to the energy sector. This profit reallocation is not typically healthy for overall stock market performance. Economic Impact Of US Oil Production The recent release of US household net worth presents a relatively optimistic picture in aggregate, with net worth only slightly below all-time highs. US Household Net Worth: 1Q 2025 While it is correct for pessimists to point to rising US consumer debt levels since the pandemic lows, the ability of households to handle that debt remains at better-than-pre-pandemic levels. US Household Debt Levels Further to rising consumer debt, credit card debt has also increased, but delinquencies remain below pre-pandemic levels. Credit Card Delinquencies Overall, US households are in a reasonable financial position to withstand an increase in oil prices. Much of the positive story relies on the US labor market remaining resilient. There are signs, as indicated by slowing payroll job growth and rising continuing claims for unemployment benefits, that the job situation is deteriorating. As noted previously, a rise in oil prices disproportionately negatively impacts lower-income households, who are already struggling with the elevated inflation of recent years. As expected, the Federal Reserve made no change to short-term interest rates last week. The meeting continued the trend of the central bank holding steady under “elevated” uncertainty about the economic outlook. The updated median estimates from the Fed still call for two rate cuts this year. Under the surface, the forecast showed a considerable difference in opinions among members, with seven expecting no cuts in 2025 and ten forecasting two or more cuts. To underscore the lack of confidence in the outlooks, Chair Powell said, “No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction.” Markets currently expect two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is little chance of a cut in July. Instead, the first move lower in 2025 is expected in September. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts The betting market priced in slightly higher odds of a recession in 2025 following the beginning of the bombing of Iran. This relatively small increase in recession risk is consistent with the decline in stock prices. Notably, markets currently project a relatively low risk of a US recession, which is consistent with the fundamental health of the US economy and its current resilience to higher oil prices. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession The primary economic risk of the Israel-Iran conflict is the potential threat to oil supplies, which could lead to significantly higher oil prices. Higher oil prices are a headwind to global growth. While higher oil prices are a significant drag on many sectors within the US economy, the profits from US oil production provide a positive offset. Within industries, high energy prices reallocate profits from other sectors to the energy sector. Stocks within the energy sector tend to outperform when oil prices rise and underperform when they fall. S&P 500 Energy Sector Relative Performance Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a significant allocation to energy stocks, which account for approximately 11% of the publicly traded stock portfolio, compared to a little over 3% of the S&P 500. Berkshire controls almost 27% of the outstanding shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which, combined with its Chevron (CVX) position, results in a significant overweight in the energy sector. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Buffett has noted that energy investments are a bet on oil prices over the long term. Based on past geopolitical conflicts, investors should be prepared for pressure on stocks at the start of any widening conflict. While the timing is always unclear, stocks have rebounded as the uncertainty surrounding the events waned. If energy stocks aren’t already part of their diversified portfolio, investors should consider allocating some portion of their portfolio to energy stocks. The energy sector is expected to benefit from rising oil prices, providing some offset to the pressure on other industries.

June 22, 2025 09:33 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Bengaluru: Raymond Realty, which is scheduled to list on the stock exchanges on 1 July, is looking at faster growth through higher home sales and several project launches in 2025-26, said a top company executive. The real estate firm was demerged from Raymond Ltd on 1 May and will list as a standalone entity. Mumbai-based Raymond Realty clocked around ₹2,300 crore of sales in FY25, and is targeting at least 20% growth this year. It also expects a 20% return on capital employed. Also read: Gautam Singhania meets European royal Prince Albert II: Here's why they met, what they discussed & more By the end of FY26, it plans to launch six projects - two in suburban Thane, where Raymond owns about 100 acres, and four projects in different locations across Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) - Wadala, Sion, Mahim and Bandra. The developer currently has six projects under execution. Raymond Realty's residential portfolio, combining projects under execution and the ones to be launched, has a gross development value (GDV) of ₹40,000 crore. Of this, projects worth ₹25,000 crore GDV would be in Thane alone. The remaining projects of ₹15,000 crore GDV are in MMR. “In the next 3-4 years, we will double our sales and portfolio size. As a company, we are trying to solve for two things in the industry - quality of projects and timely delivery. We also want to focus on post delivery service, and have started our own facilities management arm," Raymond Realty chief executive Harmohan Sahni said in an interview. Also read: Centre links part of state capex loans to new reforms in land, and digitization The demerger will consolidate the group's real estate business under a single entity, which, going forward, will further unlock the firm's potential as a pure-play property development vertical. The company will sell at a broad price range of ₹20,000-65,000 per sq ft, and is not looking to sell below that, or in the uber luxury category. “We can't go lower than ₹20,000-22,000 per sq ft. We will not dilute the brand, and it is not a price-sensitive market," he added. MMR, India's most valuable property market, stands as one of the leading contributors to pan-India launches and sales. Most of the projects Raymond Realty has signed are redevelopment projects. The newly signed projects, in Mahim and Wadala, are a Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) redevelopment and a slum redevelopment project respectively. Also read: Centre weighs easing conditions for interest-free capex loans to states “We will continue to pursue an asset-light model by signing projects through the joint development route as it is capital efficient. We are a net debt-free company," Sahni said. Beyond Mumbai, the company is exploring project opportunities to enter the Pune property market. “We are choosy about the deals we want to sign," he added. MMR among all the top cities witnessed the highest sales of around 155,335 units in 2024, almost the same as 2023. Pune followed with around 81,090 units sold. The two western markets together led residential sales last year, said Anarock Property Consultants. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: A revolutionary drug for extreme hunger offers clues to obesity’s complexity

By Claire Sibonney, KFF Health News Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction. The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn’t suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. “It’s crazy,” said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. “All of a sudden, they flip.” Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn’t address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. GLP-1 agonist medications Ozempic, Wegovy and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions. But what’s becoming clear is that obesity isn’t one disease — it’s many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity’s drivers can be environmental, familial or genetic. “It only makes sense that it’s complex to treat,” Yanovski said. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn’t respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn’t significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity’s many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation’s infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a “Make America Healthy Again” agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. “That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now,” said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. “We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions,” he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she’d spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She’s heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she’s seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. “It opens up their world in so many ways.” Over 26 years in practice, she’s also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean’s mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body’s strongest hunger signals. “In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away,” said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company’s first drug. “In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn’t exist. It’s literally your brain telling you, ‘You’re starving,’ as you eat.” GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR’s possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug’s average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the co-payments will be “minimal.” Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno’s stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. “Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite,” said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa’s School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He’s more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — “Star Wars,” “American Ninja Warrior” and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. “Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable,” Foley Shenk said. “Now, we have our son back.” ©2025 KFF Health News. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Title: What Analysts Think of Micron Stock Ahead of Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-micron-stock-ahead-of-earnings-q3-fy2025-11756888

Micron Technology (MU) is slated to report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with analysts expecting the memory chip maker's profits to more than double from a year ago. Analysts on average expect Micron to report revenue of $8.86 billion, up 30% year-over-year. It's projected to post adjusted net income of $1.86 billion, or $1.61 per share, up from $702 million, or $0.62 per share, a year earlier. In March, the Nvidia (NVDA) partner posted quarterly revenue that topped analysts' expectations, thanks in part to data center sales tripling on growing AI demand. Of the 11 analysts covering Micron tracked by Visible Alpha, nine have a “buy” rating for the stock, alongside two “hold” ratings, though their consensus price target near $121 would suggest a slight decline from Friday’s close at $123.60. Shares of Micron have been on a tear in recent weeks, and have added nearly half of their value in 2025 so far. The results also come after Micron earlier this month announced plans to boost its U.S. investments to about $150 billion in memory manufacturing and $50 billion in research and development. The chipmaker said most of the money would be used for "two leading-edge high-volume fabs in Idaho, up to four leading-edge high-volume fabs in New York, the expansion and modernization of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia," and advanced its high-bandwith memory packaging capabilities.

Title: The Sources of Global Economic Uncertainty

22 June 2025 Time taken to read : 5 Minute The recent surge in government bond yields has forced business leaders and investors around the world to confront a critical question: Should corporations lock in debt at current interest rates before they rise further? At the same time, higher capital costs and persistent market volatility are compelling investors to reassess their portfolios. The question has become increasingly urgent as the yield on ten-year US Treasuries has climbed 50 basis points to 4.5% in less than a month. The yield on 30-year Treasuries is approaching 5% after rising 30 basis points in May alone. Beyond short-term market swings, at least five structural shifts could reshape the global economic landscape, with the potential to upend corporate strategies, erode investment returns, and further undermine growth prospects. First, there is the United States’ deteriorating fiscal position. The Congressional Budget Office’s latest forecast assumes a ten-year Treasury yield of 4.1% in 2025, falling to 3.8% by 2035. But given that the ten-year yield is already hovering around 4.5% and interest rates are expected to stay elevated, the federal deficit could expand far more quickly than previously anticipated. America’s fiscal trajectory is already unsustainable, with the CBO projecting that the federal budget deficit will increase from 6.2% of GDP in 2025 to 7.3% by 2055. Even more alarming, the debt-to-GDP ratio – currently 124.3% of GDP – could reach 156% by 2055 if current trends persist. The second source of uncertainty involves credit default swaps (CDS), which helped fuel the 2007-08 global financial crisis. Since Moody’s downgraded America’s sovereign credit rating from triple-A to Aa1 in May, the cost of insuring against a US default has risen sharply, as markets increasingly treat US government debt as a higher-risk asset. In fact, US CDS spreads now exceed those of countries with a similar credit rating, such as the United Kingdom, and are trading at levels comparable to those of Greece and Italy, both of which are rated BBB. Similarly, insuring US government debt now costs more than insuring Chinese government bonds, despite China’s lower A1 rating. A third issue is the opacity of private credit markets, which represents a long-term structural vulnerability. BlackRock predicts that private credit assets under management will more than double to $4.5 trillion by 2030. As more capital flows into private markets – both equity and debt – pricing becomes less transparent, making it harder for investors to value assets. The continued expansion of opaque private markets also increases the risk of leverage building up unnoticed. Much of this debt lies beyond the reach of regulatory oversight, leaving analysts and policymakers without the data needed to assess or model the true extent of systemic risk. In an environment marked by growing uncertainty, they must be prepared to adjust their portfolios and capital-allocation strategies to account for a wider range of risks and potential outcomes. Unregulated credit markets may be especially vulnerable to cascading failures, while persistently elevated interest rates heighten the risk of default. If left unaddressed, these vulnerabilities could result in widespread financial distress and job losses, ultimately triggering an economic downturn. Fourth, the relationship between the US dollar and interest rates appears to be changing. Historically, rising bond yields have supported a stronger dollar, while falling yields tended to weaken it. Since late March, however, bond yields have climbed even as the dollar has declined by 6% against the euro. This divergence suggests that global markets are repricing the premium on holding dollars and are now demanding higher returns. US stocks have also been volatile, suggesting that the repricing of risk premiums on dollar-denominated assets extends to equity markets. Rising yields reduce the value of existing bonds, signaling that Treasuries are no longer viewed as a reliable hedge against stock-market turbulence. Lastly, many Americans remain heavily exposed to equities. According to one estimate, stocks account for more than 70% of US households’ financial assets. This makes the recent surge in bond yields and the rise in economic uncertainty particularly concerning, as both developments point to fundamental shifts in market dynamics. The business leaders and investors most likely to succeed in this rapidly shifting landscape will be those who grasp the far-reaching implications of economic and geopolitical trends. In an environment marked by growing uncertainty, they must be prepared to adjust their portfolios and capital-allocation strategies to account for a wider range of risks and potential outcomes.

Belfast native Helen McAlinden is a fan of natural fabrics, particularly in the bedroom. As a designer of the home range for Irish heritage brand Foxford for almost 20 years, she uses its new linen bedding in her own home, a sea-facing terrace in Blackrock. It comes in three stonewashed colours: a soft sunrise pink; an aqua green that is the colour of the Irish Sea; and a gentle glare-free white. It gives a look of casual ease, she says. “It’s not trying too hard but yet it looks really sophisticated. It’s light to sleep under, cool in summer and warm in winter, and you don’t need to iron it. I don’t want to iron or pay someone to iron for me.” It uses Irish flax that is woven in Guimarães, northeast of Porto in Portugal – a region known for its weaving – and dries faster than cotton. Its long fibres make it smooth to the touch and give it tensile strength, she says. “It’s also low maintenance. You just wash it and hang it out on the line.” Now you can see and touch this bedding range in the new Foxford shop in Dundrum Town Centre, as well as other outlets such as Arnotts, where Mags Fitzgibbon is the brand manager. “One thing Foxford has always had is distribution in the tourist industry, but it is more than that, it is a lifestyle brand,” says McAlinden. Indeed, its throws drape beds in ultra-luxe hotels such as Ballynahinch Castle and Ashford Castle and have found their way on to overseas hotel beds, including the Cornwall-based Hotel Tresanton, part of the Polizzi Collection. In addition to bed linen and throws, Foxford can supply almost all bedding needs, except the mattress, she says. For that she opts for a King Koil design, made in Ireland. She then layers her bed, starting with a mattress cover, made in Co Mayo for Foxford. A fitted bottom sheet is her foundation garment. Foxford’s new linen range has a generous depth of 40cm so it will fit any mattress height and stops you having to wrestle with the base to try to get the bedding over the mattress corners. She also insists on luxuriating under a top sheet, a touch that works in summer, on hot nights. Then it’s a featherlight duvet. Her main bedroom is bedecked in the aqua colourway, for it works with the warm grey of the walls, painted in Athena 858 by Benjamin Moore, and the seascapes of Dublin Bay that she can see from her home in Blackrock. The colours work with the animated greys and greens of the water breaking below. Her down duvet is Danish band Danica. “I spent €300 on it when I didn’t have €300, bought it in Copenhagen airport and carried it home as hand luggage. It’s the only thing I can sleep under.” On the nights when there’s a chill in the air, she adds a honeycomb waffle 100 per cent cotton throw, €139, also Foxford. The feather and down pillows are part of Foxford’s bedding range, made in Mayo. She opts for the empire-size, two of which will fit across her super-king bed. “It is an Irish-designed bed.” The new collection, launching in the autumn, will feature additional colours, including a denim blue, a deep inky green, a mauve and nacre, a pearlescent colour. There will also be stripes, fresh takes on toile de jouy, and contemporary checks for the Christmas market. The brand also offers a 400-thread count boxed cotton bedding set that can be customised with monogrammed embroidery or another such message, a great wedding gift to give. Easy ways to ensure your bed is well dressed, according to Mags Fitzgibbon, brand manager for Foxford at Arnotts Pillows should fit the width of the bed. If you sleep on a king-size bed buy king size pillows, which measure 50cm by 90cm instead of the standard 50cm by 75cm. This will fill in the gap in the centre of the bed. Continental pillows, 65cm squares, can be used to dress the bed. They also prop you up if you like to read or watch TV in bed. Mattress depths vary. There are about 10 different depths available. Before buying new fitted sheets, measure the depth of your mattress, to include any other layers; toppers, covers or electric blankets that will add to its height. Sales staff can then direct you to the brands that do those sizes. A flat sheet or top sheet has two purposes. It cuts down on how often you have to launder your duvet cover, and it adds a layer that feels silky to sleep under. When choosing a duvet, pick a size up from the size of the bed it will cover. Lay a king-size duvet on a double bed, for example, and so on. It gives a better look to the bed and hides part or all of the divan sides. It also gives enough cover to accommodate two people. The standard pillowcase with an inside flap, also known as the housewife, is so-called as it was developed in the 1880s by the Housewives Co-operative in Bolton to keep the pillowcase in place. Before that pillowcases were simple sleeves. Oxford pillowcases have the same internal dimensions as the housewife, but have an external edging. The pocket-springs in the Vesteroy mattress have been designed to respond independently to each other, meaning you can have a great night’s sleep regardless of whether your partner tosses and turns. The springs also allow air to circulate whilst you sleep. From €318 at ikea.ie. Rimel is a lacquered metal bedside table that comes in two colour options, the teal, pictured and a bone white. It stands 61.5cm high and has a circumference of 48cm, with a rattan top covered with tempered glass and a secret storage. €234.99 from laredoute.com. Joules Thornton king-size bedframe, €1,625, exclusive to DFS, comes in a blue stripe, floral or pink, to order. dfs.ie This velvet feather filled cushion, Fia, 40cm by 60cm, €58, also comes in 58cm squares, €75. The print will add a taste of the tropics to summer nights. harveynorman.ie This Birdie pistachio and petal coloured, frill-edged duvet cover and matching pillowcases set is a frivolous way to bring the trend for stripes into the boudoir. About €84 excluding delivery and charges from frenchbedroomcompany.co.uk. This white gold confetti-effect glass lamp, €59, from next.ie, looks good and is wireless and rechargeable. This bedside table in natural oak has tambour doors to hide all your bits, €100, jysk.ie This Favour lamp has a powdercoated steel frame and an acrylic shade, €105, from pieces.ie. A rug underfoot softens the feel of timber floors.

Title: See Jane 128 by Arktronics run (ft. Magic Desk, 3-Plus-1 and the Thomson MO5)

REWIND and PLAY I never used Jane myself back in the day, or for that matter any 128 native word processor, and even when we got a 128 I still wrote my term papers in Pocket Writer 64 or Timeworks Word Writer. However, that faulty but repairable Australian Commodore 128DCR I got last Christmas came with a big box of software and in there was a complete copy of Jane 128 along with the data disk the previous owners' family had used. They were delighted when I said I wanted to take a whack at converting their files as a thank you — and along the way we'll take a look at Jane's oddball history, the original Apple II version, the Commodore 128 version and its all-but-unknown port to the French Thomson MO5, plus those other attempts at productivity applications Commodore tried in the mid-1980s. PETs, of course, had many productivity software options and even the VIC-20, if suitably upgraded, could manage basic tasks. Some small businesses reportedly even used them for simple finances. The 64 itself was hardly an ideal productivity machine when introduced in 1982, but it was certainly far more up to the task than the VIC-20 was and many such software packages were naturally available later on. Initially, however, dealers and customers openly groused about the absence of a spreadsheet or even a word processor, much to Commodore chief Jack Tramiel's profound displeasure. The task of rectifying this situation was handed to executive Sigmund Hartmann and his recently consolidated Commodore Software division, formed in April 1983 from the prior two separate software units handling system software (under Paul Goheen) and games (under Bill Wade). At least one side project would become critical to the reworked division. Engineer John Feagans had been the initial developer of the PET Kernal, its internal ROM-based operating system, which pioneered the then-novel idea of separating I/O and other system routines from the built-in Microsoft BASIC. (Prior versions of BASIC on early microcomputers often simply drove devices directly.) Feagans' innovation facilitated the use of these routines by user-written machine language programs through a standardized jump table, which was reused and greatly expanded by Bob Russell for the VIC-20 and 64. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. At least one side project would become critical to the reworked division. Engineer John Feagans had been the initial developer of the PET Kernal, its internal ROM-based operating system, which pioneered the then-novel idea of separating I/O and other system routines from the built-in Microsoft BASIC. (Prior versions of BASIC on early microcomputers often simply drove devices directly.) Feagans' innovation facilitated the use of these routines by user-written machine language programs through a standardized jump table, which was reused and greatly expanded by Bob Russell for the VIC-20 and 64. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team. C1541 is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions. c1541 #8> dir 0 "data#000 " 01 2a 39 "c.TESTCALC" prg 3 "l.TESTLIST" prg 4 "w.nOTE.2" prg 4 "w.TESTCONV" prg 1278 blocks free. c1541 #8> read "w.TESTCONV" ERR = 62, FILE NOT FOUND, 00, 00 cannot read `w.TESTCONV' on unit 8 invalid filename As you may have guessed, that's because the filenames, and it turns out the data in the files themselves, are stored as true ASCII, not PETSCII (indeed as they would have been on the Apple II, also), so c1541's filename conversion fails. Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them.

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As you may have guessed, that's because the filenames, and it turns out the data in the files themselves, are stored as true ASCII, not PETSCII (indeed as they would have been on the Apple II, also), so c1541's filename conversion fails. Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ?

'{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Fortunately it doesn't look like the bad sector was in any of the files they cared about. Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Cardfiles are stored much more efficiently. Here's the entirety of our two cards. The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting.

For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent.

Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that.

With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete.

Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway.

The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well.

RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ?

Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later.

It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market.

Title: Narwal Freo Z10 Robot Vacuum — Australian Review
URL: https://ausdroid.net/news/review/2025/06/22/narwal-freo-z10-robot-vacuum-australian-review/
Time Published: 2025-06-21T23:41:12Z
Full Content:
I’m lazy. I quite like doing as little as possible that resembles a “chore”, and yet, I enjoy living in a nice, clean, tidy space. You might think these two attributes are at odds with each other, and in a way, they are … however not entirely. Even a lazy person can have a moderately clean space with a little bit of help, and that’s precisely what Narwal’s Freo Z10 robot vacuum offers me. A little bit of help… and it goes a long way. In a nutshell, the Narwal Freo Z10 is a robot vacuum and mop system. Superficially, it presents the same aesthetic that robot vacuums have since their inception – little round discs that float around your house, vacuuming up dust, hair, crumbs and whatever else. However, there are some marked differences between the Freo Z10 and most other robot vacuums I’ve seen, and they really set it apart. For starters: This last point is one I’d like to dwell on. Anyone – and I do mean anyone – who’s had a robot vac or a Dyson stick vac or anything similar, anything with a roller, knows what an absolutely disgusting job it is to remove hair from the roller brush. Even if there are no people with long hair in your house, somehow, your vacuum will get gummed up with long hair within a few days and removing it is gross. Sometimes it comes away easily, other times you need a knife or scissors to pry it off. With Freo Z10’s DualFlow Tangle Free System, you can literally forget about this. Its three-step system will remove the long hair from your place every time, and you’ll never have to cut it out of your vacuum. Its clever sweeper arms can fold into different shapes when it detects a hair tangle, and it spins them down to the roller which effortlessly sucks the hair off and into the dustbin. I think the thing that I like the most is that, for the most part, I don’t have to think about or see the Freo Z10, whether it’s working or resting. When its resting, it’s quiet and out of the way.. yes it takes up a bit of space in my laundry, but I can close the door, and that’s done. I just have to make sure the door’s open before I leave for work in the morning, and Freo Z10 can get to work. When its working, it’s quiet, deftly avoids most obstacles (though it can get caught up on mobile phone charger cables) and works quickly. It can mop and vacuum my entire apartment in an hour or two, and it’s so quiet that I don’t usually hear it should I happen to be working from home… unless of course it decides to vacuum under my feet. Yes, I don’t let it go into the kids bedroom, because they’re pathologically incapable of picking up socks, cables, toys, and whatnot, and I don’t really want my house clean to be interrupted by the Freo Z10 getting trapped in there before it’s finished everything else. It’s great in the kitchen, too – it vacuums first, then comes back to mop after on its usual program (which you can customise as you see fit), but it’s good for cleaning up ad-hoc messes too. The other day I spilled a coffee in the kitchen, and while I picked up the big bits of the broken cup, there were little shards of ceramic everywhere, as well as most of the contents. Freo Z10 went to work, and while it vacuumed first – and cleaned up all the shards – it did mean it drove through the coffee and I was a little concerned it might wheel coffee tracks over the carpet to get back to its base station. I’m not exactly sure how, but it this didn’t eventuate – the mop pads definitely were a bit brown, but it lifted them out of the way to drive over the carpet, cleaned itself, came back and finished the job. With no intervention whatsoever – besides picking up the larger ceramic pieces that you’d never vacuum anyway – my kitchen was returned to a sparkling clean state within ten minutes. So, too, were Freo Z10’s mop pads – the base station has a deep wash cycle after each mopping exercise, which rinses, washes, and then dries the mop pads. The downside is that it gets through a bit of water to do this, and the grey water tank needs emptying after three or four cycles, but the plus side is a functional mop every time, no stinky wet-mop smell, and a clean house. Can’t complain. Not a great deal. The elephant in the room is the price – Narwal’s Freo Z10 retails for $1,599 at the time of writing, down from its launch price of $1,999. It remains quite expensive, though, and there are definitely more affordable options on the market. However, it is a case of getting what you pay for, and with the Freo Z10, you get all the bells and whistles. It’s a top class vacuum. When I say you get all the bells and whistles, though, there are a couple missing. Yes, Freo Z10 integrates with your choice of voice assistant from Google, Amazon or Apple .. but the integration isn’t amazing. I had a few goes with Alexa and found that it generally didn’t work all that well – after pairing, it seemed reluctant to actually work, though this might’ve been more Alexa’s shortcoming than anything else. It pairs to Google Home, too, but it seems that when its paired with Alexa, you can’t pair it with anything else, which is a bit limiting if you happen to use both. It doesn’t integrate with Home Assistant, and Narwal’s developers have (according to discussion on Reddit) declined to make that possible in future, which smart home aficionados might be a little upset about. As much as I’d love this feature, it’s easy enough to run Freo Z10 on a schedule, and the phone app makes it easy to schedule ad-hoc tasks. The obstacle detection is really good – probably among the best in class – but even still, Freo Z10 manages to get caught up. Twice I’ve found it with a mouthful of my USB-C phone charger, once it ate my daughter’s swimming bag, and it chowed down on a hairbrush (??) one day. However, these were minor things and easily adjusted to avoid future problems, and in the last week, there’s been no jams or anything. Yes.. you do have to clean up a bit for your cleaner, the cliche holds true. Yes. Probably the only reasons you’d think otherwise is the cost, if you don’t have room for what isn’t the smallest base station around, or if you’ve already got a decent robot vacuum. Otherwise, for the lazy homekeeper, the Narwal Freo Z10 is a welcome addition and will reduce your household chores significantly. Yes, it can’t clean your toilets or scrub your shower down, but it can vacuum, mop and sweep, freeing you up for those less pleasant jobs. Narwal’s Freo Z10 retails for $1,599 and you can buy it online from Narwal Australia, Amazon (with delivery in a couple of days), or you can find it in-store at Costco nationwide, Good Guys, and JB HiFi (though not all retailers have actual stock, it might be more a delivery thing).

Title: What to expect when (or if) Elon Musk launches a Tesla robotaxi service

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been promising self-driving cars for a decade, and the moment of truth may finally be here. Musk, who’s mostly back in the private sector after his chain saw-wielding turn in the Trump administration, has said that Tesla plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on Sunday. Though he said the exact day could still shift, Tesla appears to be getting close to making an attempt, with videos spreading online of road tests where no human is in the driver’s seat. But Tesla is also starting from behind. Waymo, a spinoff of Google, is already running a robotaxi service in several cities including Austin, and the service has a growing following. Safety remains a key question. Musk has rejected the idea of using radar and lidar sensors on Tesla vehicles, instead relying on cameras in a departure from some rivals. He has said the Tesla robotaxis are using a “new version of software” that’s relatively untested. Federal regulators have been raising concerns about Tesla’s driver-assistance software for more than a year, saying it contributed to hundreds of avoidable crashes, including some fatal crashes. Waymo’s service has not reported any fatalities. Here’s what to expect from Tesla’s planned service. Musk said this month that the robotaxi launch would be, “Tentatively, June 22.” Musk has predicted for years that autonomous Tesla vehicles were just around the corner, to the point where it’s become a meme. Musk told Fortune magazine in 2015 that autonomy was two years away, and he said in 2019 that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the roads in 2020. Texas Democrats on Wednesday asked Tesla to delay its launch until September, when a new state law could take effect and require robotaxi operators to obtain a state permit. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Very few people, at least to start. Musk has said that the service will begin very small, with as few as 10 vehicles the first week. They’ll operate in Austin, but Tesla hasn’t said how large its service area will be. There is no public waitlist, although Musk has said he wants to grow the service within a few months to catch up to Waymo. On Friday, some people on Musk’s social media app X posted screenshots of what appeared to be invitations to “early access of Tesla Robotaxi.” Robotaxi services work like a Lyft or Uber ride-hail service: A user orders a ride on a phone app by entering their starting point and destination. The key difference is that there’s no one in the driver’s seat, although it’s not clear whether Tesla will have someone in the front passenger seat, as it has during test drives, or how much remote control of the car Tesla will have. Waymo says its service covers 37 square miles in Austin, and customers there can order rides through the Uber app, in a partnership between the two tech companies. Waymo is also available in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco and Atlanta, with plans to expand to Miami and elsewhere. Nationwide, Waymo says it has 1,500 vehicles on the road, plus parking lots, electric charging stations, maintenance staff and engineers to support the vehicles. “Waymo is far and away the leader of the development of the technology here, and over the last 15 years has been evolving both the technology and related infrastructure to support what they’re doing,” said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Transportation and Logistics. Tesla is calling its service Robotaxi, but so far the company has not succeeded in getting a trademark for the term. Experts say that no one knows how safe Tesla’s service will be. “I’m glad they’re starting small,” said Greg Stevens, the research director of Mcity, a testing lab for autonomous technology at the University of Michigan. “As an engineer, I’m a real fan of small launches. Keep it simple in the beginning: launch a small number of vehicles and watch them very, very closely,” he said. Phil Koopman, an associate professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, said that only a driving record over tens of millions of miles will determine Tesla’s safety. “Success is no crashes and no serious mishaps for the rest of the year, at least,” he said. “Safety is not something where you can go look at the car and see that it’s safe.” Tesla has a different approach to safety than its chief competitor. While Waymo uses a combination of cameras, radar and lidar to keep its bearings, Tesla relies on cameras only. It’s an approach that Musk says is less expensive and “superior” to using lidar, while federal regulators have said that Tesla’s cameras may have trouble seeing in certain conditions such as fog and glaring sun. Musk has said that Tesla is “being super paranoid about safety.” He has also said a more advanced version of Tesla’s autonomy software “still requires a lot of polishing.” Texas has had relatively permissive laws about autonomous vehicles: Unlike in California, there’s no state regulator in Texas that needs to sign off on the service. That may change in September, when a proposed Texas law requiring robotaxi operators to get authorization from the Department of Motor Vehicles is set to take effect. The bill has passed the state House and Senate and is awaiting action by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. If Tesla launches Sunday and Abbott signs the bill into law, it’s not clear what would happen under the new law this fall. A spokesperson for the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles said Friday that the department would need time to put the law into effect and begin enforcement, a process that would most likely stretch into next year. Austin city officials also say they’re prohibited under state law from regulating autonomous vehicles, but they have been documenting examples of safety concerns. In the first five months of this year, the city said it collected data on 35 safety incidents, such as blocking traffic, involving various companies. Austin officials said that as of Friday, they had not documented any safety incidents involving Tesla autonomous vehicles. “The City treats each AV company that expresses interest in Austin the same, offering training opportunities and providing information about City right-of-way and procedure,” Jack Flagler, a spokesperson for the Austin transportation department, said in an email. He said the city had provided Tesla and others with maps, special event information and information about fire and police procedures. Tesla has sought to block the city of Austin from releasing government records about its planned service, according to Reuters. Tesla has not publicly outlined any contingency plans, but if rival companies are a guide, Tesla will have staff ready to assist either in person or remotely. Test vehicles spotted in Austin have been followed close behind by what some people speculate to be “trailing” vehicles driven by humans. Companies such as Waymo and the now-defunct Cruise say they can and do intervene remotely with vehicles if there’s a problem — which for Cruise meant every 4 to 5 miles, according to CNBC. Cruise later shut down following a highly publicized crash involving a pedestrian. Tesla posted a job related to teleoperations and told Wall Street analysts to expect telesupport, according to Wired magazine and auto site Electrek, but the company hasn’t provided details. The stakes are high for the whole robotaxi industry. “That’s my big worry: that all the progress we’ve made gets halted by some sort of major safety incident,” Stevens said. Musk has said that safety and regulations will guide how quickly Tesla tries to expand the number of vehicles in the service. He told CNBC in an interview last month: “I think we’ll probably be at a thousand within a few months.” He also mentioned expanding to California, though Tesla does not have the permit required to operate there. Musk has also hyped a new vehicle, called Cybercab, that Tesla could potentially use for its robotaxi service, though for now the company is using existing model vehicles. And eventually, Musk has said that individual Tesla owners would be able to offer their vehicles for hire in the robotaxi service, but he has not set a date for when that might happen. “How long did it take Waymo to scale up? Years and years and years. And there’s no reason to believe it will be different for Tesla,” Koopman said. The scheduled launch of the robotaxi service has helped to buoy Tesla’s stock price in recent months, after the company’s sales and profits cratered during Musk’s time in the Trump administration and the resulting “Tesla Takedown” protests against him and the company. Some investors think Tesla will be able to scale up its service quickly to dozens of cities over the next year, creating a new source of revenue while possibly also boosting vehicle sales. Some experts think that is the main point of the robotaxi launch. “I think the objective that is paramount is stabilizing Tesla’s stock price,” said MIT’s Reimer. “This is as much of a media stunt as anything else.” David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN paid to a 15-year-old boy from Dundalk who died by drowning after getting into difficulty in the river Nanny in Laytown, Co Meath. The boy has been named locally as Kofi Owusu, from the Blackrock area of Dundalk, Co Louth. It’s understood that he had jumped into the river with a number of other children from the footbridge in Laytown when he got into difficulty in the river. The principal of Coláiste Chú Chulainn in Dundalk, Thomas Sharkey, said that the school is heartbroken over the loss of Kofi. He told RTÉ News Kofi was a “fine young man, very kind, a very caring and a very diligent student.” Sharkey added that supports will be put in place for students and staff within the school community at this difficult time. The school posted a statement to social media which said that Kofi was a “very caring young man with a wide circle of friends” and an “accomplished sportsman”. Kofi had recently played in an All-Ireland basketball final and in a Leinster soccer final in his age group of under-16. He had finished his Junior Cert exams just ten days ago. Advertisement Junior Minister Thomas Byrne has said he was devastated to hear of Kofi’s death. “My heart goes out to his family, friends, all those who were around Laytown tonight, and all who are grieving. “A summer moment has turned into an incalculable loss. “Thank you to the Coast Guard teams, emergency services, and local volunteers who responded. “Please respect the family’s privacy and Gardai have asked to avoid sharing any images or details online,” he said. Local councillor in Laytown Carol Lennon told The Journal that the community is in shock following the tragic incident. “Kids jump off that bridge every year, and I suppose no group thinks the worst is going to happen, and yesterday it did. Someone had actually raised safety concerns about jumping off the bridge during the week in the town, and now this has happened three days later, it is just awful. “Everyone is thinking about the boy’s friends and family at this terrible time. “We need more affordable access to swimming lessons, and better water safety education through schools so children know what to do when it comes to public waterways, and also what the best thing to do is if someone you are with gets into difficulty, or if you yourself get into difficulty. There is basic knowledge there that we need to share, because it saves lives. “Unfortunately in this case it’s too late. This was a tragic, awful accident and support will be needed for the other boys who were there and witnessed this, who have lost their friend and been through something traumatic,” she said.

Tributes have been paid to a teenage boy who died while swimming near a Co Meath beach yesterday afternoon. The teen has been named locally as Kofi Owusu (15) from Blackrock, outside Dundalk in Co Louth. The teenager tragically died after he got into difficulty swimming in the water under the footbridge in the River Nanny near Laytown beach. It is understood that Kofi, who was with a group of friends at the time of the incident, was visiting Laytown on Friday for a day out at the beach. His body was recovered from the water by the coastguard and his remains were taken to Our Lady's Hospital in Navan where a post mortem will take place. He was a student of Coláiste Chú Chulainn and a talented soccer player, he played for Redeemer Celtic FC in Dundalk. Gardaí say they are aware of videos of this incident that are currently in circulation and are requesting footage and imagery not to be shared. In a tribute, the school said: “This is a terrible tragedy for Kofi’s family and friends, the Coláiste Chú Chulainn community and the local community of Dundalk and the surrounding areas, who are deeply saddened by this event. “Kofi Owusu completed his Junior Certificate in Coláiste Chú Chulainn in June 2025. “Kofi was a very caring young man with a wide circle of friends. He was a diligent student and a regular awardee for excellent attendance. Kofi was also an accomplished sportsman. He was a member of the school’s under 15 soccer team and represented the school in the recent Leinster Shield final on the 19th May 2025. "Kofi was also a member of the school’s under 16 basketball team and represented the school in the All Ireland final on the 23rd January 2025. "Our sympathy and thoughts are with Kofi’s family and friends at this time.” The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of the Department of Education and Youth have been in contact with the school and will be supporting and advising staff iin their efforts to assist our students. Redeemer Celtic shared a touching tribute to Kofi on social media, showing two of his number 6 jerseys laid down on a soccer pitch alongside a bouquet of flowers, with the caption: “We are heartbroken. Closed until further notice.” An outpouring of tributes from members of the Dundalk community was shared underneath the post. As a mark of respect, local soccer club Laytown United FC announced it had postponed a planned end of season presentation day scheduled for Saturday. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this heartbreaking incident,” the club said in a statement on Facebook. “We appreciate your understanding. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.” Meanwhile, this is the second teenager that has been confirmed dead in two separate swimming tragedies as temperatures remain high across the country. Peter Byrne (17) tragically died after getting into difficulty while swimming in the River Barrow in Co Carlow on Tuesday. The late Peter Byrne. Photo: RIP.ie Separately in Co Dublin, four teenagers were injured after getting into difficulty in the water in two separate incidents in Howth. The Irish Coast Guard has issued an advisory reminding the public “to take extra precautions in and around water” over the weekend. Kofi Owusu, aged 15, from Dundalk died after getting into difficulty while swimming at Laytown on Friday evening Today's News in 90 seconds - 21st June 2025 Condolences have been offered to the family of Kofi Owusu for their “devastating loss”, local representatives said. Minister of State and Meath East TD Thomas Byrne said it was “devastating to hear of the tragic death of a teenage boy” in Laytown. “My heart goes out to his family, friends, all those who were around Laytown tonight, and all who are grieving,” he said on X. “A summer moment has turned into an incalculable loss.” Cathaoirleach of Meath County Council Wayne Harding said: "A young boy has lost his life tragically off our coast this weekend. My thoughts are with his devastated family at this time. "I want to thank all those who responded to the tragedy both in a professional and voluntary capacity. I ask that we be extremely vigilant to the dangers all our water courses pose during these good weather spells." Local East Meath Cllr Carol Lennon said: "The loss of life in tragic circumstances is devastating and we, as a community want to offer our sincere condolences to the families of the boys involved in the tragedy that occurred in the River Nanny on Friday night. “What started as a great summer's day ended with the loss of a young life, a teen, enjoying the first tasters of Summer of 2025. "I would personally like to thank the emergency services who attended so fast and showed great compassion to the friends and families at the scene”. Councillor Sharon Tolan said “a dark cloud” was hanging over the community on Friday night. “My thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the tragic accident in Laytown,” she said on Facebook. “Please think long and hard before posting any commentary on any social media pages.” Irish Coast Guard has issued an advisory reminding the public “to take extra precautions in and around water” over the weekend. In a statement shared on social media, the Coast Guard urged the public to take precautions and said rip currents “are the leading surf hazard for all beachgoers". Rips are described as strong currents “that start near the shore and rush out seaward, quickly taking you out of your comfort zone, from the shallows to deeper water.” If caught in a rip current, the advice from the Coast Guard is to remain calm and swim out of the current in a direction following the shoreline. According to the Coast Guard, rip currents “typically form at low sports or breaks in sandbars, and also near structures such as groynes, jetties and piers.” Meanwhile, the funeral of teenager Peter Byrne (17) who died swimming in Milford, Co Carlow will take place on Monday. Mr Byrne was swimming with two of his friends when he got into difficulty. The young man's body was recovered at 11.30pm Tuesday night by divers from the Garda Water Unit within a 10 metre radius of where he was last seen. "It is with a very heavy and broken heart that we share the devastating news of the passing of our much beloved youths player Peter Byrne who tragically passed away this week,” read a statement from New Oak F.C. "Peter was a pocket rocket in the team over the last number of years. Small in stature but big in personality. He was a huge character with a touch of Roy Keane about him, not afraid of anything or anyone. "Peter was the life and soul of the dressing room and training and will be sadly missed by his coaches Ernie, Danny and all his teammates who have not only lost a fellow player but a friend. "On behalf of everyone at New Oak F.C we would like to offer our deepest condolences to Peter’s family and friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with all who loved him. May Peter’s gentle soul rest in peace.” In Dublin, the Howth RNLI volunteer crew were involved in a multi-agency response to two cliff rescues off the coast of Howth, North Co Dublin, on Thursday afternoon. They received reports of three children cut off by the tide near Lion's Head, which is a popular swimming spot on the south side of the Howth peninsula, close to the Bailey Lighthouse. The injured teenager is winched to safety by Rescue Helicopter 116. Photo: Howth RNLI Shortly before 4.30pm, the inshore lifeboat was launched by the RNLI, with three crew on board, assisted by the Howth Coast Guard Unit and Coast Guard helicopter Rescue 116, who quickly made their way to the scene amid moderate sea conditions. Two teenagers, who were stranded on the cliff, were located by the Howth Coast Guard cliff team. As the team tried to recover one of the injured teenagers, the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Dublin, which coordinated the rescue, asked the lifeboat crew to remain on standby. While on scene, the lifeboat was diverted to a separate emergency nearby where a teenager had fallen from cliffs at White Water Brook, a remote beach below cliffs on the eastern side of the peninsula. Howth RNLI crew member climbs onto rocks at the base of cliffs in Howth. Photo: Howth RNLI The lifeboat crew were directed by beachgoers to a teenager, who had fallen approximately six metres onto rocks at the water’s edge, sustaining multiple lacerations and suspected fractures. A second teenager had swum to assist him and was holding him steady on a rock when the lifeboat arrived at the scene. The lifeboat crew made their way across rocks to assess the injured teen, assisted by the Howth Coast Guard and Howth All-Weather lifeboat. However, due to the swiftly rising tide, the injured teen needed to be immediately evacuated by a helicopter. The Rescue 116 deployed its winchman, who assessed the teen’s injuries and secured him in a rescue harness, winching them both to safety. The second teenager was showing the signs of hypothermia and was assisted across the rocks and brought aboard the inshore life boat. He was later transferred to the lifeboat and taken to Howth Lifeboat Station, where he was handed into the care of an ambulance crew and transported to the hospital. Helm of the inshore lifeboat, Killian O’Reilly, said: “This was a challenging afternoon with two serious incidents in quick succession, both in difficult, rocky locations.” "On a sunny summer’s day, it’s easy to underestimate the risks around the coastline – but the sea and cliffs can be unforgiving. "The teamwork shown between the RNLI, Coast Guard units, and Rescue 116 was exceptional and ensured the best possible outcome in tough circumstances,” he added. He urged the public to be aware of the dangers and know what to do where they might find themselves in difficulty in the water, especially during this spell of hot weather. “Air temperatures may feel warm, but water temperatures are cold enough year-round to trigger cold-water shock. If you get into difficulty, remember float to live: tilt your head back, with your ears submerged. Relax and try to breathe normally. "Move your hands and legs to help you stay afloat. Once you've regained control of your breathing, you can call for help or swim to safety,” he added. The members of the public are advised to call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coast Guard if they or someone else gets into difficulty near the coast.

Artificial intelligence is ideally suited to replacing the very type of person who built it. The job of the future might already be past its prime. For years, young people seeking a lucrative career were urged to go all in on computer science. From 2005 to 2023, the number of comp-sci majors in the United States quadrupled. All of which makes the latest batch of numbers so startling. This year, enrollment grew by only 0.2 percent nationally, and at many programs, it appears to already be in decline, according to interviews with professors and department chairs. At Stanford, widely considered one of the country’s top programs, the number of comp-sci majors has stalled after years of blistering growth. Szymon Rusinkiewicz, the chair of Princeton’s computer-science department, told me that, if current trends hold, the cohort of graduating comp-sci majors at Princeton is set to be 25 percent smaller in two years than it is today. The number of Duke students enrolled in introductory computer-science courses has dropped about 20 percent over the past year. But if the decline is surprising, the reason for it is fairly straightforward: Young people are responding to a grim job outlook for entry-level coders. In recent years, the tech industry has been roiled by layoffs and hiring freezes. The leading culprit for the slowdown is technology itself. Artificial intelligence has proved to be even more valuable as a writer of computer code than as a writer of words. This means it is ideally suited to replacing the very type of person who built it. A recent Pew study found that Americans think software engineers will be most affected by generative AI. Many young people aren’t waiting to find out whether that’s true. “It’s so counterintuitive,” Molly Kinder, a Brookings Institution fellow who studies AI’s effect on the economy, told me. “This was supposed to be the job of the future. The way to stay ahead of technology was to go to college and get coding skills.” But the days of “Learn to code” might be coming to an end. If the numbers are any indication, we might have passed peak computer science. Chris Gropp, a doctoral student at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, has spent eight months searching for a job. He triple-majored in computer science, math, and computational science at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and has completed the coursework for a computer-science Ph.D. He would prefer to work instead of finishing his degree, but he has found it almost impossible to secure a job. He knows of only two people who recently pulled it off. One sent personalized cover letters for 40 different roles and set up meetings with people at the companies. The other submitted 600 applications. “We’re in an AI revolution, and I am a specialist in the kind of AI that we’re doing the revolution with, and I can’t find anything,” Gropp told me. “I found myself a month or two ago considering, Do I just take a break from this thing that I’ve been training for for most of my life and go be an apprentice electrician?” Gropp is contending with a weak job market for recent college graduates in general and the tech sector in particular. Although employment for 22-to-27-year-olds in other fields has grown slightly over the past three years, employment for computer-science and math jobs in that age group has fallen by 8 percent. Not long ago, graduates from top comp-sci programs—such as those at Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon—would have been fending off recruiters from Google and Amazon. Now, professors at those schools told me, their graduates are having to try much harder to find work. Gropp’s dad, William Gropp, runs the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “I can say, as the father of a computer-science master’s degree holder with expertise in machine learning who is still looking for a job, that the industry is not what it used to be,” he told me. In the ultimate irony, candidates like Gropp might be unable to get jobs working on AI because AI itself is taking the jobs. “We know AI is affecting jobs,” Rusinkiewicz, from Princeton, told me. “It’s making people more efficient at some or many aspects of their jobs, and therefore, perhaps companies feel they can get away with doing a bit less hiring.” Derek Thompson: Something alarming is happening to the job market The best evidence that artificial intelligence is displacing tech workers comes from the fact that the industry that has most thoroughly integrated AI is the one with such unusually high unemployment. Tech leaders have said publicly that they no longer need as many entry-level coders. Executives at Alphabet and Microsoft have said that AI writes or assists with writing upwards of 25 percent of their code. (Microsoft recently laid off 6,000 workers.) Anthropic’s chief product officer recently told The New York Times that senior engineers are giving work to the company’s chatbot instead of a low-level human employee. The company’s CEO has warned that AI could replace half of all entry-level workers in the next five years. Kinder, the Brookings fellow, said she worries that companies soon will simply eliminate the entire bottom rung of the career ladder. The plight of the tech grads, she told me, could be a warning for all entry-level white-collar workers. Not everyone agrees that AI is causing the turbulence in the job market. The tech industry frequently goes through booms and busts. The biggest companies exploded in size when the economy was good. Now, with high interest rates and the specter of new tariffs, executives are likely holding off on expanding, and workers are reluctant to leave their job, says Zack Mabel, director of research at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Companies have an incentive to blame layoffs on AI instead of forces within their control, David Deming, an economics professor at Harvard, told me. “Before we see big changes from AI in the labor market, companies have to internalize this new capability and change what they ask for. And that’s the thing that I have not seen very much of,” he said. “It could be AI, but we just don’t know.” Enrollment in the computer-science major has historically fluctuated with the job market. When jobs are scarce, people choose to study something else. Eventually, there aren’t enough computer-science graduates, salaries go up, and more people are drawn in. Prior declines have always rebounded to enrollment levels higher than where they started. (And some universities, such as the University of Chicago, still haven’t seen any enrollment drops.) Sam Madden, a computer-science professor at MIT, told me that even if companies are employing generative AI, that will likely create more demand for software engineers, not less. Read: Silicon Valley braces for chaos Whether the past few years augur a temporary lull or an abrupt reordering of working life, economists suggest the same response for college students: Major in a subject that offers enduring, transferable skills. Believe it or not, that could be the liberal arts. Deming’s research shows that male history and social-science majors end up out-earning their engineering and comp-sci counterparts in the long term, as they develop the soft skills that employers consistently seek out. “It’s actually quite risky to go to school to learn a trade or a particular skill, because you don’t know what the future holds,” Deming told me. “You need to try to think about acquiring a skill set that’s going to be future-proof and last you for 45 years of working life.” Of course, when faced with enormous uncertainty, many young people take the opposite approach and pursue something with a sure path to immediate employment. The question of the day is how many of those paths AI will soon foreclose.

Title: Weekend reading: A content-rich resource for investors, and a call for TA 2.0

What caught my eye this week. With AI chatbots and search overviews now vigorously putting the boot into an online media that was already on its knees, quality independent websites covering investing and money are shrinking faster than violets at an OnlyFans convention. Good news then that the curation site Snippet Finance has started maintaining a content hub for investors, with links to all kinds of resources. You’ll find a few Weekend Reading favourites in its listings. But there’s plenty of other lesser-seen websites, tools, and other useful stuff to explore, especially if you’re a professional or dedicated amateur finance nerd. Be sure to check out Snippet Finance itself. Creator Yuri is the Hemmingway of investment editorial. This introduction is twice as long as a typical Snippet post. Incidentally, I just dived into the Monevator vaults to find a similar listing I ran early in the life of this website. Of the blogs I tracked, only us, Mr Money Mustache, Financial Samurai, and Simple Living in Somerset (renamed) are still standing. Talking of the bonfire of the blogosphere, any investing maniac starting today who wants to talk about their favourite subject online – doubtless having been banned from doing so by exhausted family and friends – would probably have to gurn into an iPhone to create videos for YouTube or TikTok. Maybe that’s you – but then again maybe you’re more a great one for a witty adverb, rather than the next Mr Beast? If so then Monevator would benefit from a new and brilliant regular writer. We’ve had several over the years, but somehow they never last. Often they discover they haven’t got as much to say about FIRE, personal finance, or index funds as they thought they did after the third article. Most just can’t write the Monevator way. (It’s not so hard. Take the day off and yet still be at it at midnight. Never use two words when three will do. Add some obscure references to 1980s music and 1990s video games and you’re all set!) Honestly it probably won’t work out with you either. But I’d still love to hear from you if you’ve got a lot to share. Ideally you’ll be more towards the start of your journey than we are. Not phobic about smartphones and investing apps. Maybe you even bought an NFT of a cartoon gorilla during the 2021 crypto mania before repenting your foolish ways. But mainly you’ll be on-message with sensible investing. A bit of personal finance hackery – stoozing, credit card rewards, current account bonus chasing – wouldn’t hurt either. (It all adds up in your 20s.) We’d want a bit of personality in the mix. Judicious. Tasteful. Nothing too influencer-y. Can you point me to a bit of writing you did earlier? Brilliant. Get in touch via the Contact form if you’re the person all your friends go to about investing. Just so long as you write better than ChatGPT, and without it too.

Very 1990s/Gen X 🙂 Luv it. Long may you continue. Good luck finding a new contributing author. The root problem surely remains that FIRE, or pursuit of FI, for the vast majority of people boils down to earning more, spending less and stashing (MMM influence?) the surplus. How to string that out week after week is a challenge.

Hi I’ve been receiving your newsletter for many years, always looking forward to the interesting content and links. But since you’ve tried to monetise the site, the free content has become very week. Probably best to scrap it and concentrate on subscription. Interesting pieces by Swedroe/Alpha Architect and AQR. Problem is neither of AA nor AQR actually offer up any ISA/SIPP friendly, non-exorbitatant products to tap their research. Loved these from Snippet Finance “1984.. energy..made up 27% of S&P 500 earnings, today…1%”, cost of urban 1km tunnel in NY $4 bn, Paris $230 mn, and S. Korea $100 mn. Perhaps these explain why energy/commodities so underowned as a diversifier (despite mean reversion potential of being the worst performing asset class from 2011) and why UK/US infra ITs’/CEFs’ woes seem worse than you’d expect even given high rates. Nice set of links – thanks. Blanchett paper chimes with observations I have made @M (& elsewhere) over the last year or so. Interesting!

Title: Digital Asset Revolution – How Blockchain Is Turning Real-World Assets Digital
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/06/20/digital-asset-revolution-how-blockchain-is-turning-real-world-assets-digital/
Time Published: 2025-06-21T03:40:59Z

The combination of established finance and blockchain technology opens up different opportunities for asset ownership, liquidity and worldwide access. The economic environment is experiencing a paradigm shift as the migration of RWAs (real-world assets) onto blockchain networks is exemplified by creating digital representations of real, tangible value, including the ability to be traded, fractioned and accessed worldwide. This transition is not a mere case of technological innovation. Still, it can be considered a recasting of our worldview of ownership, liquidity and financial inclusion in this digital era. The tokenization revolution gains momentum Real estate asset tokenization has progressed from a speculative idea to a multi-billion-dollar global capability. Among the over $250 billion of tokenized assets, Ethereum holds about 55% of the market share and settles itself as the leading infrastructural platform of this digital transformation. That will include US Treasuries, real estate, commodities and intellectual property. The gains in this movement are charging at a fast pace. Assets such as real estate, treasuries and others are now being converted to liquid on the blockchain, which has over 18 billion in market value, and the prospects of it growing huge in the future. In the industry, it is anticipated that even greater growth will be evident in the future, considering that the market of tokenized assets, such as stablecoins, is currently forecasted to increase to 18.9 trillion in the year 2033, as suggested by a study by Ripple and BCG. Busting the conventional boundaries The idea of tokenizing assets is so popular because it helps to address the essential inefficiencies of conventional financial markets. Traditional asset ownership usually involves large down payment requirements, complicated intermediaries and statement periods. Tokenization resolves these concerns since this technology generates digital tokens reflecting fractional ownership of physical, real-world assets. Think of real estate – one of the most illiquid asset classes. With tokenization, commercial real estate valued in millions of dollars may be separated into thousands of digital tokens, each reflecting a minute share of ownership. Shareholders can buy these tokens at a much smaller financial outlay, sell them off on the secondary market, earn an equivalent fractional rent of the underlying property and have exposure to genuine property appreciation. This partial ownership is in no way limited to real estate. Art collections, vintage wines, precious metals (such as gold) and even income streams around intellectual property can be tokenized, enabling access to these investments to a broader pool than ever before. Thus, the investment process previously open only to institutional investors and the super-rich can be democratized. The technology foundation Asset tokenization is based on smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts whose terms are encoded directly into code. Such digital contracts automate several processes that have been handled by intermediaries up until now, such as the distribution of dividends or compliance checks. Embedding coded rules in digital tokens and the ability to observe and be linked to RWAs may result in financial tools enabling automatic compliance, capital calls and distributions, making more efficient end-to-end fund products. The blockchain platform on which such tokens run offers several essential benefits. Growth is institutionally adopted The tokenization sector gained considerable credibility with the arrival of large financial companies. BlackRock announced its tokenized fund in March 2024, and asset giants like Franklin Templeton have launched their tokenization plans. This institutional legitimization has fueled the adoption and made the space legitimate in the eyes of traditional investors. The use of tokenization in financial assets should continue expanding in 2025 as a concept and an implementation, as adoption among large banks and asset managers is already bearing fruit. These institutions’ participation contributes capital, regulatory know-how and operational infrastructure that needs to be adopted to get mainstream. The development of regulation and local dominance The global regulatory environment regarding tokenized assets is changing quickly, and various jurisdictions are approaching oversight and compliance differently. Increased regulatory sandboxes and similar programs will enable the permissible growth of tokenization use cases among financial institutions, with more nations in APAC remaining at the forefront. These sandbox regulatory places offer a controlled platform for financial companies to experiment with tokenization solutions. They closely collaborate with regulators to establish documented frameworks. This joint plan aids in balancing innovativeness, investor protection and financial stability. Nevertheless, there are still issues like regulation. The regulation of asset tokenization involves a serious debate between the necessity of data privacy and the transparency of blockchain technology. Moreover, in most jurisdictions, the legal maturity of smart contracts is unassured, putting tokenization ventures into question. Conquering challenges of implementation Although asset tokenization has excellent potential, it also has various practical challenges that should be overcome to be readily adopted. Success stories and acquisitions Asset tokenization is gaining ground in various sectors in the following areas. The way to the future In 2025, tokenized assets will coexist with traditional instruments, and combining innovations with tradition will generate specific hybrid models to ensure that the world of financial markets is faster, more transparent and accessible to more people. This hybrid scheme can be gradually adopted with enough consideration for traditional investors and regulators. Coupling the sale of tokenized assets with existing financial infrastructure opens up a massive opportunity for market players. Banks can implement new products and services, asset managers reach a wider audience of investors and portfolio diversification becomes feasible using access to new assets previously unattainable to an individual investor. Yet, it will be successful, provided it can overcome some of the present issues regarding the integration of technologies, clarity of regulations and market development. Companies that can afford to implement adequate infrastructure, maintain a proper compliance framework, and concentrate on the user experience will be in the best place to utilize the transformation. Conclusion RWA tokenization is a monumental change in conceptualizing ownership and value transfer in the digital economy. This innovation uses blockchain technology to provide digital versions of physical and financial assets, enabling the democratization of investment opportunities, increased market efficiency and new opportunities for institutional and retail investors. Although there are still hurdles regarding regulation, technology and market maturation, the trend is unmistakable because the industry is becoming increasingly institutional and the regulation less experimental. The companies that learn and respond to this change will be in a good position to take advantage of the future of the tokenization of assets market, which will be worth 18.9 trillion in the next decade. Not all aspects of the digital asset revolution involve technology. They include redefining the very structures of finance to be inclusive, efficient and accessible worldwide. In the future, we expect that the seamless connection of RWAs into blockchain networks will require constant interaction between technologists, regulators and financial institutions to create a more interconnected and globalized financial process.

Title: Report: Apple has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/06/20/report-apple-held-internal-discussions-acquiring-perplexity/

UPDATED 19:42 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 by Maria Deutscher Apple Inc. executives have held discussions about buying Perplexity AI Inc., Bloomberg reported today. The publication cited sources as saying that the talks are in an early stage and may not lead to an acquisition. Perplexity reportedly received a $14 billion valuation in a recent funding round. To be accepted, any takeout offer made by Apple would likely have to be higher. San Francisco-based Perplexity operates a consumer-focused search engine powered by artificial intelligence models. Rather than returning a list of webpages in response to queries, the service generates a natural language response. It can also visualize stock price changes, analyze user-uploaded files and perform other tasks. Perplexity had more than 15 million monthly users last April, a number that has likely increased significantly since then. The company recently disclosed that it processed 780 million user requests in May. Moreover, the volume of queries that it receives is growing by 20% every month. Perplexity generates revenue by offering two paid editions of its search engine. The first, Perplexity Pro, gives users access to reasoning models from providers such as OpenAI. There’s also an Enterprise Pro plan geared towards large organizations. Perplexity’s other revenue source is its Sonar suite of application programming interfaces for developers. Using the APIs, software teams can embed the core features of the company’s search engine into their custom applications. Adrian Perica, Apple’s vice president of corporate development, has reportedly discussed the idea of buying Perplexity with a number of other executives. It’s believed the search provider wasn’t involved in the talks. However, Apple representatives did meet with Perplexity executives multiple times recently to discuss its technology. Today’s report follows an unsuccessful attempt by Meta Platforms Inc. to acquire Perplexity. According to Bloomberg, the Facebook parent walked away from the deal over disagreements about financial terms. Meta later made a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI Inc., a startup that supplies training datasets for AI development projects. It’s believed that Apple could eventually decide to partner with Perplexity instead of buying it. Such an arrangement would likely cost significantly less. Additionally, it would have a lower chance of drawing scrutiny from antitrust regulators. The acquisition discussions come against the backdrop of a high-profile antitrust trial over Google LLC’s search business. Currently, the Alphabet unit pays Apple billions of dollars annually to keep its search engine the default option on iOS. The lawsuit could potentially require the companies to end the payments. If that happens, Apple may be more inclined to partner with Google competitors such as Perplexity. Perplexity is not the only AI startup that has drawn takeover interest. According to CNBC, Meta recently tried to buy Safe Superintelligence Inc., a company co-founded by former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever. After the offer was rebuffed, the Facebook parent reportedly shifted its focus to recruiting the startup’s top executives.

Solana, XRP, and Litecoin spot ETFs are near-locks at 95% odds of approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of 2025, the analysts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart of Bloomberg, wrote Friday. Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche spot ETF applications are also sitting quite pretty, according to the analysts, with 90% chance of approval by year end. If the above altcoin ETF applications receive an SEC green light in the coming months, then the development would mark a substantial milestone in the history of Wall Street. Thus far, the agency has approved only two categories of crypto spot ETFs: Bitcoin and Ethereum. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 The success of those funds has spurred additional demand for crypto-focused ETFs and other related investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now manage well over $100 billion in assets, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) reaching $70 billion in AUM faster than any fund in history, based on company data. Crypto’s two top tokens have long been considered to belong to a league of their own in terms of legitimacy, stability, and staying power, and even their approval for mainstream trading was no easy feat. Among the current batch of contenders for spot ETF trading are tokens that have significantly smaller market values and less established reputations than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Dogecoin, for instance, is the world’s first meme coin; Avalanche is the native token of a network that boasts less than 2% of the total value locked on Ethereum. DOT, the native token of the Polkadot blockchain, boasts a market capitalization of just $5.2 billion, compared to $293 billion for ETH and $2.06 trillion for BTC, according to data provider CoinGecko. Should spot ETFs of such altcoins begin trading on Wall Street, that would mean that traditional financial institutions and retail investors would be able to gain direct exposure to the tokens, which have historically been volatile. Issuers of spot ETFs actually buy and store the cryptocurrencies represented by the financial products on behalf of clients. Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Decrypt it was a foregone conclusion that crypto ETFs would explode as soon as President Donald Trump, who campaigned avidly as a pro-crypto candidate, was reelected last fall. “It is regarded as inevitable that we’ll see many other single-asset and multi-asset ETFs of digital coins and tokens,” Edelman said. “The Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs will prove to have been merely the first." “And all that’s just the start,” he continued. “Tokenization is underway and once all assets are tokenized, there will be thousands of ETFs, or their tokenized equivalents, launched. It’ll be the biggest explosion of investment opportunities ever." The Bloomberg analysts’ confidence that the SEC may soon approve so many crypto ETFs beyond BTC and ETH stems in part from the agency’s openness to engage with requests to list them in recent months—requesting updated details and public comments on numerous applications. The applications have been filed by several Wall Street firms, ranging from crypto-centric investment managers like Grayscale to TradFi stalwarts including Fidelity and Franklin Templeton. “Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion,” Bloomberg’s Seyffart said. Another factor that has likely increased the odds of imminent spot ETF approvals for the altcoins in question is the fact that, in recent months, the CFTC has approved futures markets for all of them. Futures ETFs track the prices of derivatives contracts for assets, but do not involve the actual buying or selling of the underlying asset. While the Bloomberg analysts are confident that altcoin spot ETFs will garner approvals before the end of the year, the exact timing remains uncertain. Seyffart said they could come in the next month, or perhaps not until the late fall—but that at this point, the question is a “matter of when not if.” Brian Rudick, chief strategy office at Upexi, a publicly traded Solana-focused treasury company, told Decrypt that while ETF approvals for certain altcoins with lower trading volume may not necessarily result in immediately higher demand for those tokens, Wall Street debuts could have a dramatic price impact on more popular tokens like Solana. “While demand for ETFs on long-tail alts may not materialize, ETFs based on top assets like Solana will likely see strong inflows and may act as a large positive catalyst for the price of the underlying token,” Rudick said. “Indeed, the spot ETFs were the main reason the price of Bitcoin more than doubled from when BlackRock applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-2023 through the exceptional inflows over the first six months after launch.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Photo Credit: Ramp offers corporate cards as part of its tech service for managing business travel and expenses. Ramp Startups for business travel management and flying taxis are still raising a lot of money. Select a question above or ask something else There’s a lot of money going into tech platforms to manage business travel and expenses. The most recent is Ramp, which raised $200 million this week. It comes months after TravelPerk raised $200 million, with multiple other companies raising smaller rounds. Also this week: Navan, a corporate travel agency, has taken a step toward becoming a public company. And flying taxi companies — most recently Archer Aviation — have been raising billions of dollars in their race to operate commercially. Between Ramp, Archer Aviation, and a small startup, travel companies raised over $1 billion in the past week. Ramp, an expense management platform with travel booking capabilities, has raised $200 million in series E funding. The latest funding values the company at $16 billion, a jump from $13 billion since its previous fundraise in March and $7.65 billion since its series D extension in 2024. Founders Fund led the round for the fifth time. Other investors included Thrive Capital, D1 Capital Partners, General Catalyst, GIC, ICONIQ Growth, Khosla Ventures, Sands Capital, 8VC, Lux Capital, Stripes, 137 Ventures, Avenir Growth, and Definition Capital. Ramp said it has now raised a total of $1.4 billion in equity financing. The New York City-based company started with a focus on corporate cards and helping clients manage receipts, but it’s been building out tech since 2022 to help client companies book and manage travel. The company’s Ramp Travel product allows clients’ employees to book travel with inventory from Priceline. The platform also has integrations with TravelPerk, Lyft and Uber for Business. Ramp automatically collects receipts from any bookings with partners, removing the need to submit expenses. Client companies can set travel policies and manage approvals through the platform. Ramp last month released a feature that automatically rebooks a hotel if the price drops. It’s one of 270 features that the company has released this year, which the company said were all developed with the help of AI. Ramp said it has more than 40,000 companies, including CBRE, Shopify, Anduril, Notion, Cursor, Vercel, and Barry's. The company said its platform handles $80 billion in purchases annually. Ramp said the funding will go toward improving the AI-powered product and expanding business, particularly in the U.S. Archer Aviation, which is developing a flying taxi for urban use, has raised $850 million. The funding comes from a direct offering of 85 million shares of stock for $10 per share. The company had previously raised nearly $2 billion, including $430 million last year. California-based Archer is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft called Midnight. It is designed to hold a pilot with four passengers and luggage for urban trips of 20-50 miles at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. It is powered by six independent battery packs, each supporting a pair of electric engines. The company is also developing aircraft for the U.S. military. Archer said in May that it plans to provide air taxi services for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and for Team USA. The company last year unveiled plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles. The network includes vertiports (eVTOL airports) at Los Angeles International Airport, University of Southern California, Orange County, Santa Monica, Hollywood Burbank, Long Beach, and the Van Nuys neighborhood. The company is also planning to establish a vertiport near the SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles football teams Rams and Chargers. The plan is to begin LA network operations in 2026. This is in addition to plans for a network at California airports where Southwest Airlines operates, along with five vertiports in the Bay Area. Travlounge, which designs roadside rest stops with sleeping pods, has raised $2.9 million (250 million Indian rupees). The funding comes from Gokulam Group. India-based Travlounge says its facilities include tech-enabled sleeping pods, washrooms, cafes, travel-focused markets, and charging stations for electric vehicles. The company has also released an app for trip planning. The funding will go toward expanding beyond its first two locations in India.

Title: All the reasons why Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in Q3!

Time Published: 2025-06-20T21:00:37Z

A $750 million bet, whale surge, and momentum – ETH vs BTC heats up! Q2 is nearly on the books, and Ethereum [ETH] has delivered a comeback quarter in every sense. With nearly 40% quarterly gains so far, ETH has outpaced Bitcoin’s [BTC] 28.81% ROI, marking a sharp reversal from its bruising Q1. At the time, ETH bled nearly 50% from its $3,334 opening. That drawdown left a big chunk of holders underwater. And, despite Q2’s rally, many still haven’t fully resurfaced. Could Q3 be the inflection point where Ethereum finally delivers for the holders who sat through the pain? Q1 pushed Ethereum to the edge, and early Q2 didn’t offer much relief. Structurally though, the tide began to shift. ETH has steadily reclaimed market dominance, climbing back towards its 10% share – A sharp reversal from the record low of 6.95% on 22 April. At the same time, the ETH/BTC ratio hit a five-year low, lining up with ETH’s own multi-year bottom at $1,441 in mid-April. That moment felt like rock bottom. However, it also set the stage for a serious bounce. By early May, the ratio had ripped over 25% off the lows, right as ETH smashed through the $2k resistance and sprinted to a quarterly high of $2,878 on 11 June. And yet, the move doesn’t feel like it’s run its course just yet. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) Since mid-May, the ratio has moved sideways. However, it’s been printing higher lows with every dip – A classic sign of accumulation. Buyers are stepping in faster, the pullbacks are shallower, and rotational flows into ETH remain steady. If this pattern resolves higher, ETH could carry its Q2 breakout into Q3 with serious follow-through. This could set the stage for a potential trend reversal in the ETH/BTC macro structure. Smart money isn’t backing off Ethereum. In fact, BlackRock has deployed $750 million into ETH in June so far, and hasn’t sold a single coin. That kind of conviction doesn’t show up unless the upside looks meaningful. According to AMBCrypto, with a 40% quarterly rally already in the books, Ethereum has been drawing in serious capital chasing asymmetric returns. Case in point – Lookonchain flagged a sharp move where a whale borrowed 10 million USDT to buy 3,983 ETH at $2,510.64. Clearly, it’s not just institutional flows doing the heavy lifting. The whale address count (1k–10k ETH) surged to a two-year high of 4,970 too, signaling that deep-pocketed players may be stepping back in with size. Source: Glassnode And when that kind of capital rotates in, it’s usually not by accident. Given Ethereum’s clear technical and statistical edge over Bitcoin throughout Q2, this shift feels more like a calculated reallocation than a short-term trade. Zooming out, the signals might be aligning too. With rising whale activity, institutional flows, and a strong ETH/BTC base, ETH could be set to carry its Q2 dominance into Q3, finally giving LTHs the upside they’ve been waiting on.

The past seven days in Waymo’s world illustrates just how dynamic the burgeoning robotaxi business can be. The company limited service nationwide on June 13 ahead of scheduled “No Kings” protests against President Donald Trump and his policies. Days later, Waymo announced it was expanding its robotaxi service area by another 80 square miles in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Silicon Valley. And now Waymo is eyeing the biggest city in the United States: New York City. One note on NYC: This will be a marathon for Waymo. The company is applying for a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in the city, but even if it gets approved, it won’t mean driverless testing. A truly driverless (no human behind the wheel) vehicle will require a change in state law. Expect lobbying activity to ramp up in the state. Let’s get into the rest of the news. Got a tip for us?

Applied Intuition keeps attracting investors, and it has an eye-popping valuation to show for it. The buzzy startup, which makes software that helps companies and government agencies develop autonomous vehicle solutions such as simulation software and managing data, closed a $600 million Series F and tender offer. That round, which was co-led by BlackRock-managed funds and Kleiner Perkins, pushed its valuation up to $15 billion. Yes, $15 billion.Other investors included Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Greycroft, and more. Existing investors General Catalyst, Lux, Elad Gil, and Mary Meeker’s growth fund Bond also participated. Reminder: The round comes just one year after it completed a $250 million Series E, which put the company at a $6 billion valuation. Archer Aviation raised an additional $850 million through a registered direct offering of 85 million shares at $10 per share. The company noted in its announcement that this followed President Trump’s executive order to implement an eVTOL Integration Pilot Program in the United States. Senra Systems, a Southern California-based startup developing wire harnesses for aerospace, raised $25 million in a round co-led by Dylan Field, the co-founder and CEO of design software company Figma; VC firm CIV; General Catalyst; Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund; Sequoia Capital; Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC; and Andreessen Horowitz. This newsletter used to have a dedicated section for micromobility, a reflection of its popularity at the time. Micromobility went through a period of consolidation and tightening capital, which forced the industry to grow up. But it hasn’t disappeared, and that’s why I’m bringing it back this week (and occasionally in the future).Reporter Rebecca Bellan hosted a roundtable with Voi CEO Fredrik Hjelm, Bird co-CEO Michael Washinushi, and Dott/Tier CEO Henri Moissinac at the Micromobility Europe event in Brussels. Here are some of her insights from the panel and from the broader event: Honda launched an all-electric last-mile delivery vehicle called the Fastport eQuad. The eQuad comes in two sizes built on the same basic platform, small and large. Both are smaller than the smallest Mini Cooper but can carry between 320 and 650 pounds. They have pedals, and their top speed is limited to 12 mph (20 kph), both requirements to keep them bike-lane legal. VanMoof is back and has launched its first e-bike since bankruptcy. Reporter Rebecca Bellan digs into what is the same and what has changed at VanMoof. Bellan also provided a list of startups rolling out of Europe’s early-stage micromobility scene. Zoox has opened its first full-fledged production facility, where it expects to one day build 10,000 robotaxis per year. Tesla has partnered with Electrify Expo to launch full-weekend EV test drives. This is an interesting move by Tesla, which has historically used other methods besides third-party events like auto shows or expos to attract new customers. It also could make Electrify Expo a target of protestors who are behind the Tesla Takedown movement. Zoomcar, the Indian car-sharing marketplace, said a hacker accessed the personal data of at least 8.4 million customers, including their names, phone numbers, and car registration numbers. The company became aware of the incident after some of its employees received external communications from a threat actor who claimed to have gained access to the company’s data. The Paris Air Show included lots of news under the ever-evolving category I call “Future of flight.” Too much to cover everything here, but there were a few highlights: an announcement from U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy that the Federal Aviation Administration and four other regulators will collaborate on an advanced air mobility (AAM) roadmap; Archer Aviation showcased its Midnight aircraft and hosted delegations from more than 20 countries; and Beta Technologies’ Alia became the first electric aircraft to fly at the show.

Share this article Just a few years ago, the idea of using digital currency to book a flight or pay for a service seemed unreal. Today, it happens in real time, and businesses of every size now accept Bitcoin. As of 2024, Crypto.com estimates that more than 650 million people worldwide now hold some form of crypto. Major financial institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, and PayPal have incorporated crypto into their offerings, which signals widespread crypto adoption. Consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Z, invest in crypto and actively look for ways to spend it. In this regard, businesses that adapt to these changing payment behaviors can gain a meaningful competitive edge. Let’s talk about practical benefits. When businesses accept Bitcoin payments, they often pay lower transaction fees. With Bitcoin, fees are often about $1-2, especially when using crypto payment gateways. Another key benefit? No chargebacks. Unlike credit card payments, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. It means fewer fraud claims and less back-office overhead dealing with disputes. Also, cross-border payments have become much easier. If your business serves international customers, Bitcoin can eliminate the headaches of currency exchange and high wire transfer fees. All this adds up to smoother, faster, and often cheaper transactions. Businesses of all sizes already accept Bitcoin. Shopify merchants have access to crypto payment integrations, which allow thousands of e-commerce stores to accept Bitcoin easily. In the restaurant world, spots like The Pink Cow in Tokyo and Crypto Street Restaurant in Florida made headlines for being early adopters. Even big corporations like Microsoft and AT&T have accepted Bitcoin in various forms. But it’s not just the giants benefiting. Independent cafes, freelance creatives, and small retailers report increased visibility and customer loyalty just by offering Bitcoin as a payment option. Consumers aren’t just curious, they’re ready to spend. A 2022 survey by Deloitte and PayPal found that 75% of retailers plan to accept crypto payments within the next two years, and 64% of surveyed consumers said they’d be more likely to shop with a business that accepts cryptocurrency. What’s driving this demand? Control, speed, and a sense of innovation. Consumers like to have choices, and they expect businesses to keep up with digital trends. Ignoring this shift could mean missing out on a fast-growing segment of tech-savvy customers. Let’s be honest, Bitcoin volatility is a valid concern. Prices can swing dramatically in short periods, which makes some business owners hesitate. The good news is that you don’t need to hold onto Bitcoin to accept it. Special platforms serve to convert Bitcoin into local currency instantly, which reduces your exposure to price fluctuations. Security is another common worry, but modern solutions make crypto safer than ever. Using a trusted crypto wallet for business adds a layer of protection, and payment processors handle much of the heavy lifting when it comes to compliance and fraud prevention. Getting started with Bitcoin payments is easier than you might think: Choose a payment processor. These services can integrate with your online store or point-of-sale system. Set up your wallet. Whether you use a custodial service or manage your own, having a secure crypto wallet is important to store your assets securely. Let customers know. Display online badges that show you accept Bitcoin. Promote it in your email campaigns or on social media. No deep technical knowledge is required, and setup costs are often minimal. In fact, many services are free to start with and only charge a small percentage per transaction. Accepting Bitcoin is easier than you might think. You don’t need to change how your business runs. Bitcoin payment just adds more payment flexibility for your customers. It’s affordable to set up, demand is growing, and the tools to start are easy to use. The benefits are big: you can reach new customers, save on transaction fees, speed up payments, and show that your business is forward-thinking. So why wait? The future of payments is here.

Mondelez International (MDLZ) stock was one of the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 Friday after Wells Fargo upgraded its rating and lifted its price target on the snacks and candy giant. Wells Fargo analysts lifted their rating to "overweight" from "equal weight" and raised their price target to $78 from $68, saying the "bull case feels more tangible" for the Chips Ahoy!, Oreo, and Sour Patch Kids parent. "While the company is confronting historical inflation in 2025, 1) pricing execution has been strong, 2) inflation looks likely to temper in 2026, and we see a recovery of earnings ahead," the analysts wrote. Mondelez International shares were up more than 3% in recent trading to about $68.50. They have gained roughly 15% this year.

Title: CEOs Using AI to Terrorize Their Employees

Time Published: 2025-06-20T17:09:36Z
Full Content:
As artificial intelligence becomes the corporate buzzword du jour, executives are finding more and more ways to shoehorn the trendy tech into their everyday business operations. That has a lot of workers anxious about automation, income inequality, and increased workloads — something c-suite bigwigs are all too happy to take advantage of. Though AI — really just a fun name for large language models (LLMs), or predictive chatbots — in its current state isn't likely to bring a labor revolution anytime soon, CEOs find that the threat of AI automation works just as well. As Axios highlighted this week, CEOs are increasingly using AI adoption as a cudgel to justify layoffs, or to manufacture consent for layoffs in the future. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, for example, recently said AI is likely to "reduce our total corporate workforce," while JPMorgan executives told investors that AI will allow for a "10 percent headcount reduction." Others, like Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke, are threatening workers directly, saying that AI is now the "baseline expectation." Per Axios, Shopify managers hiring human workers now have to explain to top brass why AI wouldn't be a better choice for any given job. This kind of doomsday messaging goes hand in hand with increased expectations for workers' productivity. A recent survey found that 77 percent of workers reported that AI adds to their workload. Of that, a staggering proportion — 39 percent — involves fixing the buggy tech's sloppy mistakes. While AI is a pretty recent phenomenon, these kinds of scare tactics aren't new. "Disciplining labor" is a concept that occasionally gets thrown around discussions of supply side economics. It's a term used to describe broad economic measures that keep workers in line, in order to keep corporate profits high — suppressing unions, keeping wage growth low, and dangling the threat of unemployment over their heads. In this sense, AI in its current form is simply a new whip for CEOs to use on their employees. It's having what Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, calls an "inculcation effect" on workers. It's a "warning with an anticipatory alert that preempts later trauma going viral," he told Axios. Plus, now that the job market has been devastated by AI spambots, finding a new gig is harder than ever. With AI, workers are forced onto their back foot as their corporate overlords demand more productivity for less pay. If the choice is to either work harder or clear out their desk, employees are then less likely to ask for quality of life improvements, or to organize for unions that could win them. And that, of course, means corporate honchos get an even bigger piece of the pie.

Title: Watch These Visa Price Levels as Stablecoins Threaten to Bypass Card Fees

Visa (V) shares slid this week after the Senate on Tuesday passed the GENIUS Act, providing a regulatory framework for companies issuing stablecoins. The crypto-friendly legislation could open the door for merchants to bypass card-based payment systems offed by Visa and other payments providers. Reports surfaced last week that Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) were looking into launching their own stablecoins, a move that could potentially eat away at the billions of dollars the retail titans pay in credit transaction fees. Shares of Visa were little changed in Friday afternoon trading, just above $338, leaving them down about 4% for the week. Still, they've gained roughly 7% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500, which added less than 2% over the same period. Below, we take a closer look at Visa’s chart and use technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for. Earlier this month, the stock climbed above its prominent March and May peaks, before staging a sharp reversal to form a bull trap, a trading event that lures investors to buy upon a breach of major resistance—the two peaks in this case—before the price makes a sudden move lower. As recent peaks on the chart made higher highs, the relative strength index (RSI) made comparatively shallower peaks to create a bearish divergence and indicate waning buying momentum. The stock closed decisively below the respected 50-day moving average (MA) in Wednesday’s trading session, possibly paving the way for further selling. The first support level to watch sits around $328. A retracement to this area may attract buying interest near the March swing low, which currently lies just above the upward sloping 200-day MA. A more significant drop could see the shares revisit lower support near $302. Investors may look for entry points in this region around the stock’s April sell-off low and last November’s breakaway gap. During upswings in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $350 level. The shares may face overhead selling pressure in this area near the rising 50-day MA, which currently sits alongside the late March peak and minor February trough. Buying above this level could fuel a move toward $367. Investors who have bought Visa shares at lower prices may look for exit points in this location near the March and May peaks. This level sits in the same neighborhood as a projected downside target that takes the stock’s move lower from March to April and repositions it from the May high, potentially providing clues as to how a new downtrend may play out.

Title: Real-World Asset Tokenization Hits $24 Billion As Wall Street Bets Big

ByAnastasia Chernikova ByAnastasia Chernikova, Contributor. TOPSHOT - A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during afternoon trading ... More on April 9, 2025 in New York. Wall Street stocks rocketed to close solidly higher Wednesday, with dramatic advances on all three major indexes as US President Donald Trump delayed steep new tariffs hours after they took effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 7.9 percent to 40,608.45, the broad-based S&P 500 Index rallied 9.5 percent to 5,456.90, and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped more than 12.2 percent to 17,124.97. (Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) Major financial institutions are racing to tokenize everything from U.S. Treasuries to real estate, but how long will it last? The tokenization revolution is accelerating at breakneck speed with the Senate just passing the GENIUS Act, providing the first federal framework for digital assets that Wall Street had been waiting for. Over 185 crypto tokens are classified as Real-World Assets (RWAs) with their market capitalization over $10.62 billion, a 61% increase from the previous month, according to Tangem. On top of that, the total market value of tokenized RWAs on public blockchains had surged to nearly $18 billion by early 2025, up from about $10 billion just a year before. This unprecedented growth has been driven by institutional adoption that's finally materializing. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund now holds $2.9 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, making it the world’s largest tokenized asset fund. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI follows at $776 million, while VanEck launched its tokenized RWA fund called VBILL, offering exposure to US Treasury bills across multiple blockchains in partnership with Securitize. “BlackRock tokenized a money market fund on Ethereum. Franklin Templeton is running US government bond funds on public blockchains. JPMorgan just ran a cross chain Delivery versus Payment pilot with Chainlink and Ondo. These are not retail projects. These are the most conservative institutions in finance validating a new model,” Mitchell DiRaimondo, founder at Steelwave Digital, told me in a written response. The current market shows $24 billion in total tokenized assets across 194 issuers, with over 205,000 asset holders, indicating steady growth despite market volatility. Tokenization strips away the friction that has plagued traditional asset management for decades. Settlement times drop from days to minutes, previously illiquid assets like real estate can be traded 24/7, and compliance becomes programmable rather than paper-based. “The biggest risk today is assuming that a legal wrapper and a blockchain alone create value,” Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics, told me. "Without real composability, reliable secondary markets, and trusted custody, tokenized assets remain stuck in marketing decks rather than investment portfolios." Ethereum still dominates the tokenized asset landscape, hosting the majority of Real-World Asset value. But emerging Layer 2 solutions are gaining ground as institutions seek faster, cheaper transactions. The infrastructure buildout extends beyond blockchain networks. Zero-knowledge proofs are enabling privacy-preserving compliance, allowing banks to prove asset backing without revealing sensitive financial information. Cross-chain interoperability solutions are connecting fragmented tokenized asset markets. "The introduction of zero-knowledge proofs—which make it possible to securely verify that RWAs are backed by real world assets, without revealing sensitive information—has been a huge catalyst for RWAs," Maxim Legg, CEO of The Pangea Foundation, told me in a written response. "Banks are able to prove that their tokenized funds are backed by real assets, without disclosing sensitive financial information." “It’s a structural evolution in how private credit and fixed income funds operate,” David Robnett, Managing Director of Asset Token Ventures, told me in a written response. “Tokenization solves real-world inefficiencies, such as post-trade friction, tax drag, and illiquidity. That makes growth not just sustainable, but inevitable.” Unlike the speculative crypto cycles of previous years, RWA tokens offer something fundamentally different: real yield backed by real assets. Tokenized Treasury bills currently yield 4-5%, while private credit tokens can offer 8-10% returns—comparable to traditional alternatives but with blockchain’s added benefits. “Unlike the NFT bubble, where speculative JPEGs dominated and predictably lost value, NFT 2.0, AKA Tokenized RWAs, are grounded in utility,” Dan Silverman, CEO at Balcony Technology, told me in an interview. "The RWA is worth what the underlying asset is worth, eliminating the volatility of speculative hype." While stablecoins, tokenized fiat currencies representing over $240 billion of the RWA market, have paved the way, the focus is now shifting to higher-yielding tokenized assets. The GENIUS Act’s framework creates the regulatory foundation for the broader RWA expansion. Here is the sector breakdown: U.S. Treasuries: $6.2 billion (led by BlackRock’s BUIDL at $2.5 billion and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI at $776 million) Private Credit: $12.9 billion (platforms like Centrifuge, Maple, and Apollo's new tokenized fund) Commodities: $1.4 billion (primarily tokenized gold through Tether Gold and Paxos Gold) Real Estate: Growing rapidly, with about $3.8 billion in tokenized properties "Real-World Asset is real and sustainable. It's likely to go in waves," Paul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader at Ernst & Young, told me in an interview. "We are going to move towards a second wave of real-world assets like real estate, physical infrastructure, intellectual property, and more that exist off-chain but could benefit from the automation possible with smart contracts and in the efficiency of on-chain settlement." Regulatory clarity and guidelines for tokenized assets remain critical for their future development. Infrastructure scaling with cross-chain interoperability solutions and institutional-grade custody services are also maturing rapidly. The RWA market is projected to hit a $50 billion market cap by the end of this year. For investors, this represents both opportunity and risk, but the institutional validation is real—BlackRock doesn't deploy billions into experimental technologies. "The promise of RWAs is to deliver the efficiency and immediacy of crypto markets to a wider investor pool," Stuart Popejoy, CEO of Kadena, wrote to me in a response. "We’re not trying to tear down the financial system. We’re upgrading it." The smart money is actively participating, with careful due diligence and risk management. Whether this marks the dawn of a new financial era will depend on execution.

Title: Banks that fuelled Ireland’s finance rebound face tariff angst
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/2025/06/20/banks-that-fuelled-irelands-finance-rebound-face-tariff-angst/

When the United States launched sweeping tariffs against trade partners in April, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink found himself in Ireland, one of the countries with most to lose if US multinationals were forced to curtail their operations overseas. Fink, whose company was in the running for a big contract with the Irish government at the time, toed a careful line, claiming to “understand the logic” of Donald Trump’s move while not agreeing with it, and insisting there “does not need to be a true trade war”. Almost three months on, the Wall Street giants that created thousands of Dublin jobs since Brexit are in a similarly awkward position. They’re trying to balance the challenges created by their own government with the opportunities in a country that depends on US multinationals for more than 10 per cent of its jobs and a big chunk of tax receipts. For now, the banks are hopeful their multinational clients will adapt to the trade uncertainty. “It’s not obvious to me that that falls off a cliff” under the threat of tariffs, says Marc Hussey, the Irish-born JPMorgan Chase & Co executive who returned home to run the bank’s 1,500-strong Dublin business in 2022. Assuming multinationals will “shrink overnight” would be an “extreme view”, Hussey added, and he is “not sensing that from any of our clients”. He continues to see growth in the range of businesses he oversees including a global funds administration centre, a workplace solutions business that runs employment share programmes across the world and the EMEA hub for Chase payments technology. Ireland remains popular in JPMorgan’s head office too – chief executive Jamie Dimon will travel to Dublin next month to speak at an event, his fourth such trip in six years. Almost a decade on from the Brexit vote that cut off London’s banks from several markets inside the European Union, Ireland has become a big draw for foreign lenders. They now employ close to 15,000 people, according to a report from the Federation of International Banks in Ireland (FIBI) last month, with firms including JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America leading the way to set up big EU businesses in the State. That choice puts them at the eye of the tariffs storm in a market that has long been heavily exposed to US multinationals, prompting recent warnings about the outlook for the economy and the risk to financial stability. As part of the EU, Ireland’s fate is tied to negotiations with Trump in advance of a July 9th deadline, after which nearly all of the bloc’s imports to the US might be hit with a 50 per cent levy. Across the river Liffey from JPMorgan’s offices, Citi’s 2,900 staff are working across an innovation hub, the group’s EU bank headquarters and an international corporate banking businesses. Citi chief executive Jane Fraser was in town a few weeks ago to mark the bank’s 60th anniversary in the State, and hailed Ireland as “a hub for innovation, a magnet for multinationals and a vital part of the world’s economic landscape”. The bank’s new Dublin office, to be opened next year with space for an extra 400 staff, is “a symbol of our long-term investment in Ireland and in Europe”, she added in a LinkedIn post. Hussey is hoping the move increases the chances of a long-promised footbridge that would link JPMorgan on Dublin’s southside to the northside of the Liffey, where Citi’s new office will join the Central Bank’s headquarters. Davinia Conlan, Citi’s Ireland head and chairwoman of FIBI, argues that there is “a lot to be positive about from an Ireland domestic economy perspective” and she is hopeful that Citi will ultimately fill its 3,300 capacity in the new site, though she’s not putting any timeline on that. “We’re still expecting the economy to grow albeit at a slower pace than we would’ve seen previously,” she said. Ireland also offers companies the benefit of “ease of access” to Government, Conlan said. The Department of Finance will soon launch an industry consultation on its next international financial services strategy, a successor to the Ireland for Finance strategy launched in 2020 which covers banks, insurers, funds and other firms that, combined, employ about 60,000. Regulatory simplification will be high on the industry’s wish list, Conlan and her peers say, with firms set to call on Ireland to remove some “gold-plating” of EU rules and to push the bloc to be more competitive around regulation. The international banks’ federation, FIBI, is preparing a proposal on simplification which will offer examples of areas where regulation can be “more efficient”, Conlan said, declining to offer gold-plating examples before that. Investments in infrastructure and housing, including a long-promised airport metro, will also be on the list. Fernando Vicario, who heads Bank of America’s Dublin-based EU head office, is hopeful that imminent reform of the EU’s securitisation market will offer a further boost for his 1,300-strong team, which has been retaining its earnings to support future growth. “Ireland can be a place where these securitisation deals can be packaged out of Ireland into the rest of Europe,” he said, adding that the State already commands a big presence in this market. Vicario does not expect the Irish Government to pivot to protectionist sentiment, which has cropped up in some countries in response to Trump’s trade approach. “I learned in Boston that America is Irish,” says Vicario. “In business, people stick to their positions and do business. And we do business with Irish-headquartered companies and with Irish branches and subsidiaries of US companies, all day long. I have quite frankly no problem whatsoever with our passport referring to our US origin.” Ireland has shown it has no problems with US companies either: following Fink’s careful diplomacy, BlackRock was last month named a preferred bidder to help manage the State’s upcoming multibillion-euro auto-enrolment workplace pension programme. – Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Crypto stocks soar after Senate passes stablecoin bill, Circle up over 50%

Catherine McGrath is a crypto fellow at Fortune. Shares of the first publicly-traded stablecoin company Circle continued to surge on Friday after the Senate passed legislation that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a value in line with the U.S. dollar, earlier this week. Shares of Circle are up 53%, soaring from $148 to $227, since the market opened on Wednesday after the legislation passed in the Senate on Tuesday night. Shares of other crypto-related companies increased on the news with Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange in the U.S., gaining 20% since Wednesday. The legislation, known as the GENIUS act, is a first-of-its-kind bill that would establish regulations and consumer protections for stablecoin companies, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. After passing in the Senate, it will be sent to the House of Representatives for a vote and potential revisions. Circle issues USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap behind Tether’s USDT. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed his support for the bill in a post on X after the Senate vote on Tuesday night. “History is being made, as the US Senate passes the GENIUS Act, taking us one step closer to breakthrough legislation being signed into law that will drive U.S. economic and national competitiveness for decades to come,” he wrote. The surge in Circle’s stock price comes weeks after the company’s debut on the stock market under the ticker CRCL. After pricing its shares at $31, CRCL opened on the New York Stock Exchange at $69. Within its first day on the market, the company’s shares soared to a high of $103.75 before closing at $82.23, showcasing strong retail demand for access to the stablecoin industry. Since 2021, stablecoins have become increasingly popular outside of the U.S. as a means to settle cross-border transfers and protect assets against inflation. Crypto firms, however, have long complained that the U.S. stablecoin industry has been hindered by a lack of clear regulations, especially under Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler who initiated dozens of investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies. The Senate’s passage of the GENIUS act was aided by President Donald Trump’s vocal support of the broader crypto industry. In addition to pushing for Congress to pass the stablecoin bill, Trump has established a national Bitcoin reserve, pardoned crypto criminal Ross Ulbricht and appointed SEC officials that have ended a number of lawsuits against crypto companies. With support from the U.S. president and increasing regulatory clarity, mainstream corporations are considering implementing them into their payment structures, including Meta, Google, AirBnB and X. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Andy Jassy says AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce but at least he’s honest about it

UPDATED 10:58 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the quiet part out loud this week, predicting AI will reduce its workforce. At least he’s honest about it, even if he trotted out the “free up workers for higher-value work” cliche. Microsoft is reportedly laying off 3% of its staff too, no doubt for partly the same reason. Can Mark Zuckerberg vault Meta into the top tier of AI providers via acquihire? He sure seems to be trying. Meantime, Google kept up its recent stream of new models coming with an entry-level edition, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite. Continuing a recent series of Silicon Valley tech companies chasing the opportunity in government technology, OpenAI won a hefty defense contract. Speaking of big money in AI, Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab reportedly raised $2 billion on a $10 billion valuation. And in late-breaking news, Apple reportedly has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity. Two enterprise tech stalwarts attempted to position themselves to take advantage of customers’ focus on AI and data and the evolving mix of public and private cloud services needed for that. For one, Broadcom announced the general availability of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, the latest iteration of its private cloud platform. Pure Storage also introduced its Enterprise Data Cloud, a rethink of enterprise storage aimed at recasting itself not just as a storage vendor but as a platform for autonomous data operations. At its re:Inforce conference this week, Amazon Web Services issued a raft of new features all aimed at making cybersecurity simpler, led by a preview release of a new version of AWS Security Hub. Texas Instruments joined the pack of chipmakers promising to build much more domestic factory capacity, saying it will invest $60 billion in U.S. fabs, though the time frame is not clear. Meanwhile, the Intel shakeup continued with several new executives … and several thousand fewer factory workers. Here’s all the news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Must-read for anyone wondering what’s next for data and data platforms: Ali Ghodsi’s data intelligence playbook: Turning data into agentic advantage The Wall Street Journal’s Christopher Mims joins others on cautioning against assuming AGI is around the corner: Why superintelligent AI isn’t taking over anytime soon Maybe a good thing given the dangers even OpenAI admits: OpenAI exec warns of growing risk that AI could aid in biological weapons development Moreover, it appears that ChatGPT isn’t so great for learning, at least initially: Study finds that LLM use leads to ‘likely decrease’ in learning skills Meanwhile, on the job front: Andy Jassy says generative AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce in the coming years He even used the canonical argument that these agents will free up human staff to take on more creative roles. But since Jassy is saying Amazon will have fewer employees as a result of AI, it appears that some will have to find those creative roles somewhere else. Of course, AI, like many new technologies, will also create new jobs, but it’s not yet clear how many. Amazon partner Anthropic predicts even more sweeping layoffs coming. Agentic AI is the disruption du jour at this year’s TM Forum DTW Ignite conference Report: Apple has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab valued at $10B after $2B fundraising (per Financial Times) Google updates Gemini 2.5 LLM series with new entry-level model, pricing changes Midjourney debuts new V1 video generation model Domino Data Lab introduces new AI governance, data management features Nurix AI launches enterprise-grade human-like voice AI agents with NuPlay Vehicle intelligence startup Applied Intuition raises $600M at $15B valuation OpenAI bags $200M Pentagon contract to explore defense industry AI applications Healthcare technology startup Commure raises $200M ahead of IPO AI startup Tennr raises $101M to revolutionize patient referrals Clay reportedly raises new funding led by CapitalG on a $3B valuation Maven AGI, which aims to unify the full “customer journey,” raised $50M in Series B funding Traversal launches with $48M to tackle site reliability and observability with AI Wildfire detection startup Pano AI raises $44M (per WSJ) Browserbase reels in $40M for its browser automation tools Sedai raises $20M to optimize cloud environments with AI agents Tadaweb raises $20M to scale open-source intelligence platform enhanced with AI Extend gets $17M in funding to boost the speed and accuracy of document processing with AI models Diskover gets $7.5M from Snowflake, NetApp and others to facilitate unstructured data discovery for AI Startup Typedef gets $5.5M seed funding to build customized data pipelines for AI model workloads There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Broadcom says VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 recognizes the ascendancy of private cloud And our analysis: VCF 9 goes live: Recapping the execution roadmap for Broadcom’s AI and cloud infrastructure vision Pure Storage launches unified data management cloud and new flash arrays AWS to introduce updated server CPU, new AI training chip Vibe coding, platform power and the new face of AppDev – theCUBE Research analysis Mixpanel expands analytics platform with metric trees, AI insights and experimentation tools Trend Micro debuts data center appliances with built-in cybersecurity software Key takeaways from Cisco Live 2025 Texas Instruments to invest $60B+ in US fab network Amazon to invest nearly $13B in data centers in Australia Coralogix gets $115M in funding to pioneer agentic AI-powered observability Defense technology startup Mach Industries raises $100M PostHog raises $70M to simplify software development projects Clinical AI startup Nabla to focus on agentic automation after raising $70M in funding With $27M in funding, Fleet wants to bring more freedom to enterprise device management Onebrief, a platform for operational planning and military staff workflows, reaches $1.1B valuation with $20M Series C extension, nearly doubling in 3 months Tensec to deliver real-time, cross-border payments to smaller businesses after raising $10M in funding We have lots more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps Security researchers find 16B stolen credentials from malware in open cloud storage UBS confirms employee data leak after ransomware attack on supplier INKY warns of new QR code phishing tactic using embedded JavaScript AWS focuses on simplifying cloud security at re:Inforce 2025 conference CrowdStrike launches Falcon for AWS Security Incident Response at re:Inforce 2025 Operant AI expands Gatekeeper platform with MCP Gateway for AI runtime security New Commvault and Kyndryl partnership focuses on hybrid cloud recovery and regulatory compliance Apiiro report reveals industry differences are shaping generative AI risk profiles Kusari debuts AI-powered pull request security tool for software supply chain protection Cyolo updates privileged access platform with tools to monitor unmanaged vendor connections Dashlane adds AI phishing alerts to Omnix platform to bolster credential protection Base44 joins Wix in $80M deal to support natural language software development Bitdefender to acquire Mesh Security to bolster email protection for managed service providers Neovera acquires Greenway Solutions to expand fraud testing capabilities More cybersecurity news here Waymo’s robotaxis will soon hit the streets of New York City Trump will push TikTok deadline another 90 days SpaceX competitor Eutelsat raising €1.35B in new funding And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Amar Subramanya, head of engineering for Google’s Gemini chatbot, is leaving the company, employees were told in a reorganization announced last week.

Title: Top takeaways from BI's conversations with real-estate investors
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-tips-how-to-start-investing-property-homeowner-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-20T13:16:34Z

Happy Friday! It's not goodbye. It's see you later. I start the second half of my paternity leave next week. I'll be out for the summer, but you're in good hands with my UK colleague Hallam Bullock. Just try not to give him too much grief on July 4. In today's big story, some advice for people looking to get their real-estate empire off the ground. What's on deck Markets: Why understanding Goldman Sachs' "coffee culture" is so important for interns. Tech: How Gen Z is getting around the brutal market for entry-level jobs in the tech industry. Business: It turns out that Target's loss is Walmart's gain when it comes to wealthier customers. But first, location, location, location. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. On the path to financial freedom, real-estate investing is typically a key stop. The stock market or e-commerce side hustles can be popular options, but collecting investment properties is often viewed as the Holy Grail of setting yourself up financially. But real-estate investing doesn't come easy … or cheap. There's also plenty of risk when taking on so much debt. Lucky for you, BI's Kathleen Elkins has written extensively about people who have set up real-estate empires. That includes a couple who built a portfolio of over 100 units and now work part time and travel half the year. It might sound a world away from someone just starting out, but it didn't happen overnight. When they started scooping up investment properties, Letizia Alto and Kenji Asakura didn't even own a primary residence. They shared six main pieces of advice they always follow when trying to make money in real estate. Here are some more takeaways from Kathleen's conversations with real-estate investors: It's not just for people with deep pockets: High upfront costs (down payment, closing costs, potential renovations) can be a big deterrent for hopeful real-estate investors. But a little can sometimes go a long way. A former firefighter went from earning $1,600 a month to owning over 30 properties. He spoke to Kathleen about how he got creative to land a $3 million deal with just $30,000 in savings. Do your homework: Real estate's biggest challenge can be figuring out where you want to buy something. A 32-year-old who retired early thanks to his real-estate investments shared the two software tools he swears by to find markets to buy in and price rentals appropriately. Another investor said this business book helped shape his investing strategy. The beauty of being stuck in the middle: When you think of real estate, you might immediately gravitate to vacation-style properties or long-term rentals. However, some investors see the most value in mid-term rentals. Don't forget about taxes: Generating income from multiple properties complicates how you file your taxes. But as the aforementioned Asakura put it to Kathleen, "The tax code is essentially a series of incentives to encourage certain behavior that the government wants." Here's how they get the most out of their investments from a tax perspective. 1. An intern's guide to succeeding on Wall Street. If you're one of the lucky interns in Goldman Sachs' summer class, take full advantage of the company's coffee culture to build connections. And if you're over at Blackstone, CEO Steve Schwarzman thinks you should embrace the change. 2. Citi gets an AI level-up. The bank's trio of AI strategy leaders gave an inkling of what's to come in a memo seen by BI. It's scaling AI capabilities across the company, with more than 150,000 employees now equipped with its tools. Read more about the strategy. 3. Don't overpay for your Aperol spritzes this summer. The value of the US dollar has dropped amid trade war and deficit concerns. That means unfavorable exchange rates and transaction fees can jack up costs when traveling abroad. Here are some ways to avoid excess charges overseas. 1. Is AI rejecting your job application? As companies turn to AI to boost productivity, BI has spoken to many frustrated job seekers who wonder if humans are even reviewing their applications. BI reached out to seven companies, from Kraft Heinz to Google, to find out what role AI plays in their hiring process. Spoiler: their answers varied. 2. Harvey and LexisNexis hard-launched. AI legal-tech darling Harvey is partnering with LexisNexis to let users access the vast legal database within Harvey's app. The move strengthens Harvey's claim as the go-to legal software provider as its rivals make gains. 3. How young techies cope with the industry's hiring downturn. Gen Z is staying optimistic about tech jobs, though many have had to lower their expectations and take what they can get. Layoffs, getting ghosted by potential employers, and dealing with the threat of AI are just part of the process. 1. Wait, is Walmart cool now? Clothing sales are up 23% at the retail giant this year, and shoppers are sharing "haul" videos online, impressed by its surprisingly trendy finds. BI's Katie Notopoulos found Walmart is attracting wealthier customers overall and picking up some Target defectors. 2. Efficiency secrets of the Wall Street elite. Leaders in the hot, high-growth secondaries industry are busier than ever. Fourteen industry power players told BI their top efficiency tips, from fake calendar blocks to just saying "no." 3. Peyton Manning goes from signal caller to shot-caller. Manning's Omaha Productions is looking to move its content off the field. He recently spoke with BI about his production company's success and said there's no one-size-fits-all definition of an Omaha show. Not every pro athlete reaches Manning's roaring financial success, though. Kroger reports earnings. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York. Grace Lett, editor, in Chicago. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Ella Hopkins, associate editor, in London. Jump to

June 20, 2025 09:07 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Why Elon Musk’s US$34 billion loss wasn’t really that – and what it tells us about the philanthropy of the ultra-wealthy

University of St Andrews provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Following a sharp drop in Tesla’s share price, outlets reported that the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, had “lost” US$34 billion (£25 billion) in a single day. That figure exceeds the annual GDP of countries like Iceland, Jamaica or Mauritius. Gaining or losing even 0.001% of that wealth would be life-changing for most people. But, this “loss” is entirely nominal. A decline in share prices means Musk is technically worth less. If prices rebound, so does his net worth. While such volatility can devastate smaller investors reliant on their portfolios, it is a recurring feature of ultra-wealth. Consider the US$100 billion decline in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune during his Metaverse pivot, or the US$18 billion drop Microsoft founder Bill Gates experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. These share price shifts may reduce billionaires’ net worth on paper, but they rarely affect their lifestyle. Where they do matter however is in philanthropy. Here, timing is everything. The higher the share price at the point of donation, the greater the tax benefit, and the more reputational capital to be locked in. This raises deeper questions about how philanthropic incentives are structured, and who ultimately benefits. Get your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox. Sign up to our daily newsletter to receive all The Conversation UK’s latest coverage of news and research, from politics and business to the arts and sciences. Although philanthropy is often associated with generosity, legacy or moral responsibility, these are only part of the picture. This is particularly true when it comes to major giving by the ultra-wealthy. Instead, from a wealth advisory perspective, one of the most strategically valuable (yet less publicly discussed) motivations is tax management. And, while many assume that philanthropy means donating money, tax systems often encourage the donation of appreciated assets, particularly shares, instead. As a worked example by the Bank of America illustrates, a US$50,000 donation in appreciated stock might easily present a tax benefit of almost US$10,000 over and above the tax benefits of donating the same amount in cash. Why is that? First of all, there is the potential of a tax deduction equal to the fair market value at the point of donation. The value of the asset at the point of donation is important for your tax deduction, not what you actually paid for it or whether its value is going to plunge in future. On top of that, there are opportunities to reduce other taxes too. This includes capital gains or inheritance taxes, the latter illustrated in the establishment of one of the world’s largest foundations, the Ford Foundation and its use as a vehicle to manage both inheritance tax and maintain corporate control. But the benefits of donating shares and other appreciated assets are not just financial. For high-profile donors, philanthropy also serves as a powerful tool for shaping public perceptions, projecting images of civic virtue, moral leadership, and social responsibility. It allows them to convert one form of capital, such as financial wealth, into others – social status, cultural influence or symbolic legitimacy. Volatile, appreciated and often bound-up assets can be unlocked and transformed into something far more enduring – a philanthropic legacy. Even if share prices plunge after the donation, the donor has already secured both a substantial tax benefit and a lasting philanthropic image. Tax management is a longstanding concern in philanthropy, particularly in relation to philanthropic foundations. But it really is donor advised funds (DAFs) that now warrant closer scrutiny as the real “warehouses of wealth”. Constituting one of the fastest-growing vehicles for philanthropy, DAFs act as “giving accounts”. They allow donors to claim charitable contributions and receive immediate tax deductions but without actually making an immediate charitable contribution to society. While donors technically give up ownership of these assets, they retain advisory privileges over whether and when resources are granted, to whom, and in what amounts. DAFs have no legal requirement to disburse funds within a specific timeframe. That means that any charitable spending can be delayed, potentially indefinitely, despite the upfront public subsidy via tax relief. All of these issues raise serious questions as to whether philanthropic architecture is ripe for reform. When donors can receive substantial tax and social benefits by donating volatile assets, regardless of whether or when they benefit the public, it seems that both society and the philanthropy field are shortchanged. First, significant resources are diverted from the public purse into privately controlled channels, often with limited oversight. Second, charitable giving is decoupled from charitable action or impact. Third, influence is consolidated – decisions about how public-subsidised funds are used are made not through democratic processes, but through private choice. The most corrosive effect, however, may be on philanthropy itself. As financial incentives and personal benefits are recast and presented as altruistic, the perception, purposes and potential of philanthropy for the public good risk being eroded and replaced by cynicism. This brings us back to Musk’s US$34 billion “loss”. While headlines framed it as a dramatic reversal of fortune, the real story lies not in the number but in the system behind it. For those whose wealth is held in stock, market volatility presents a tool for tax planning, image-making, strategic giving and long-term influence. What looks like loss may in fact be leverage.

The NY Times has been a major promoter of US “regime change” operations for decades. Today, while President Trump considers directly involving a US attack on Iran, the NYT is again performing this role despite many readers being skeptical or opposed. A June 19 NYT news/analysis is titled “An Islamic Republic With Its Back Against the Wall” by Roger Cohen. It seems written to pave the way for yet another US-backed or -directed “regime change”. The first sentence asserts without providing evidence that the Tehran government is “an unpopular and repressive regime”. An “Iran expert” is quoted saying, “The Islamic Republic is a rotten tooth waiting to be plucked, like the Soviet Union in its latter years.” . Screenshot from NYT . When Israel bombed the Iranian TV broadcast station as a female news anchor was reading the news, Cohen writes that “Some Iranians were overjoyed”. Cohen uses Netanyahu’s description that Israel’s attacks on Iran are “pre-emptive” and designed to “stop Iran using its enriched uranium to race for a bomb.” He does not mention that even the US intelligence agencies agree that Iran does NOT have a nuclear weapon program. Cohen goes on to quote former BlackRock executive and now German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz: “This mullah regime has brought death and destruction to the world.” Iran has invaded no countries while the US has invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria while Israel has attacked Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and now Iran. After suggesting some causes for caution, Cohen closes with his core message: the Tehran government may fall like the Berlin Wall. He quotes the “Iran expert” again: “The Islamic Republic is a zombie regime.” Roger Cohen has been an influential participant in NYT distortions and lies. In 2002, he became NYT foreign editor during the crucial run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As stated at his Wikipedia page, “He supported the invasion.” The deceit about the non-existent “weapons of mass destruction” was under Cohen’s direction. In early March, 2011, Roger Cohen said he was against Western intervention in Libya. Two weeks later, he urged the West to be “ruthless” and to kill the Libyan leader. This has turned out to be yet another disaster. The Libyan people are still paying the price while Roger Cohen has forgotten about it. Roger Cohen, representative of the Times, consistently finds a few voices of opposition, claims without evidence they represent a large group or the civilian majority, then promotes intervention, violence and “regime change”. He did this with Iraq, then Libya, now Iran. Judging from the most popular reader comments, many NYT readers are critical of this “news analysis”. The most popular comment has 1,600 endorsements. Dr. Finn Majlergaard from France says, “What right do you (Americans) think you have to decide who should be in power in sovereign countries when you can’t even deal with your own domestic dictator and the US regime’s gestapo methods against foreigners?” The second most popular comment is from Florence Massachussetts. The reader asks, “Will it be okay if a truly democratic nation bombs the United States in order to encourage regime change away from our current authoritarian rulers?” The vast majority of reader comments are critical of the drive to attack and possibly overthrow yet another government. Apparently they have learned from past foreign policy failures while the NY Times and foreign policy establishment have not. Another disaster based on false assumptions and arrogance lays ahead. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: S&P To Crash 50%? Trump Calls Jerome Powell “Dumbest”

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. President Donald Trump reignited his long-standing feud with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling him "one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government [sic]". This is new territory. President Trump had mostly resisted from hurling direct insults against Fed Chair Powell in his second term. Not any more. Could this escalate into Trump firing Chair Powell over the next few months? The comment on social media followed the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady, with the Federal Open Market Committee maintaining its target range at 4.25% to 4.5% - unchanged since December. Trump has been calling for lower rates, noting that the Fed was costing the country billions in interest payments. Facade of the Marriner S Eccles building of the United States Federal Reserve, on a bright and sunny ... More day in Washington, DC, United States, July 24, 2017. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Trump’s rhetoric sure does make headlines, but the real danger for investors is the Fed buckling under political pressure and cutting rates too soon. That could unleash a second wave of inflation, which might be more entrenched than the post-Covid surge. If that happens, expect a sharp reset in valuations, a spike in bond yields, and a steep correction in the S&P 500. Cutting interest rates before inflation is fully tamed risks igniting a more persistent cycle of price increases, forcing the Fed to respond later with even more aggressive hikes, just as it did in the 1970s, when inflation spiraled out of control. Is 50% drop in S&P possible? Consider this. Back then, the Fed’s delayed tightening led to stagflation and a severe equity downturn: the S&P 500 fell nearly 50% between 1972 and 1974. What’s more, higher valuations today, coupled with policy uncertainty, might actually make things worse. For investors seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative. This portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered cumulative returns of over 91% since inception. Trump's Policies Create The Perfect Storm? This time around, there is a risk of persistent supply-side inflation driven by policy. Trump’s policy agenda, which includes 3 things [1] tariffs, [2] mass deportations, and [3] tax cuts, could create a perfect storm of sorts. First, tariffs are a supply shock. They raise input costs and consumer prices by removing cheaper imports from the market. Second, mass deportations of immigrants who entered the country illegally sounds reasonable - after all, they’re illegal immigrants - except that it will make cheaper labor unavailable. On average, the price of services will go up. This could be a big factor driving inflation higher. Third, there are the tax cuts under Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, under which most taxpayers are expected to see a tax cut, with all income groups reportedly likely to benefit. Now, while tariffs and deportations constrain the supply of goods and services to increase prices, reduction in taxes makes more cash available to consumers. So people can spend more while prices are higher. The result would be spiking inflation, and this would make the Fed’s job a lot harder. A Replay of the 1970s? The Fed will likely pull out its 2022 playbook: it’ll have no choice but to increase interest rates - not just reverting some of the recent cuts, but in fact, going beyond, to rates above 6% and even 7% or higher for short-term treasuries. Now, if you can get a guaranteed 6% on a 1-year Treasury bill, or bank savings - risk-free investments - won’t you demand higher earnings and returns from stocks as well? There will be an exodus - a massive outflow from the S&P and overall markets from risky equities into treasuries, CDs, and savings accounts. It happened in 2022 - within months, the S&P 500 tumbled by 20%. It’s easy to forget that stocks including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) had lost more than 50% in the 2022 rate cycle alone (Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?). Smaller companies, with less cash on their balance sheets, fared even worse. That said, in 2022, inflation was largely transitory, and the Fed was able to bring it under control. This time, it could be entrenched. Covid-related stimulus money was a transient cause of 2022 inflation. This time, tariffs, tax cuts, and deportations, together, are likely to prove a stronger and perhaps much more persistent force. A replaying of the 1970s crisis is very much possible, taking the S&P 500 down. Higher rates don’t just hurt stocks - they make U.S. debt less sustainable. Annual interest payments now already exceed $1 trillion, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called it a red flag. If bond markets start to question the government’s fiscal path, yields could spike, deepening the equity selloff. On top of that, loan defaults are rising both in the commercial real estate sector and across consumer debt, like credit cards and auto loans. Big lenders like JPMorgan, BofA, and Citigroup are especially exposed. So, how much would that hurt? Well, the combined market cap of S&P 500 constituents is roughly $47 trillion. So a 50% decline in the index would mean a loss of more than $23 trillion in value. And you thought the $5 trillion-plus wipeout the benchmark index witnessed in the first few days of April 2025 was bad! How Low Can JPMorgan Stock Go In A Market Crash? A Question When things are bad, what do you expect Trump to do? Blame everyone else, or change his course on taxes, deportation, and tariffs? There’s certainly hope that his cabinet and loyalists will be able to sway his view into easing inflationary policies in the event they create spiking inflation before the U.S. economy plunges into a recession. But if the easing does not materialize or comes into play too late, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Title: What’s Happening With MSFT Stock?

More Deutschland GmbH headquarters building in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on May 30, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) With a 15% rise year-to-date (YTD), Microsoft stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) has fared much better than the broader S&P 500 index, which has gained just 2%. This outperformance is partly attributed to rising demand for Azure amid the AI boom. Microsoft’s substantial AI investments, especially its partnership with OpenAI, have made Azure a highly appealing cloud platform for businesses looking to integrate AI into their operations. Even if we look at a slightly longer timeframe, MSFT stock has doubled since early 2023, supported by three major factors: We’ll examine these drivers in more detail. While MSFT stock has delivered strong returns, those seeking growth with less volatility than individual stocks might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P 500 with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Also, see Archer Aviation: What’s Happening With ACHR Stock? Microsoft has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 32% rise in revenue, growing from $198 billion in 2022 to $270 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is fueled by several enduring factors: Microsoft's stock has experienced a significant increase in valuation multiples, with its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio jumping 48% from 9x in 2022 to 13.3x currently. Several key factors are driving this sustained growth: Currently trading around $480, MSFT stock’s P/S multiple of 13.3x is slightly higher than its four-year average of 12.4x. Refer to Microsoft’s Valuation Ratios for additional context. We believe that Microsoft’s valuation is poised for further growth driven by strategic AI initiatives. Azure will benefit from rising enterprise AI adoption, increasing demand for cloud infrastructure, and AI platform services. Additionally, AI integration across Microsoft 365 will boost productivity, enhance user workflows and collaboration, leading to higher subscription retention and premium tier adoption. These AI features are also expected to strengthen Teams engagement, drive enterprise software licensing growth, and accelerate the shift to higher-value cloud services as businesses increasingly rely on Microsoft's comprehensive AI-powered ecosystem. Despite the strong outlook, there are notable risks. In the inflation-led 2022 downturn, MSFT stock dropped 38%, declining from a high of $343 in November 2021 to $214 in November 2022. In contrast, the S&P 500 saw a smaller decline of 25%. Although MSFT rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by June 2023, a similar sell-off occurred earlier this year amid trade war concerns, where MSFT fell nearly 20%, aligning with a 19% drawdown for the S&P 500. More on this is available in our Buy or Sell Microsoft Stock dashboard. Apart from macro and geopolitical risks, Microsoft faces internal challenges, especially regarding its significant capital expenditures. Since 2022, the company’s capital expenditures bill has crossed $144 billion. A pressing question remains: What if these large-scale investments don’t yield the expected returns? Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Editor Empire Jim Quinn, The Burning Platform “But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell’s dark vision, there was another—slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.” – Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death “What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.” – Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death I find myself ruminating about whether there is anything myself or any other average Joe can do to make a difference in this world, controlled by psychopaths, satanists, egomaniacal billionaires, corrupt evil politicians, a cabal of greedy financiers, neocon warmongering globalists, and the propaganda entertainment complex. When a complex entity becomes too large, it becomes inefficient, bureaucratic, corrupt, and uncontrollable. The corruption, waste, and purposeful use of governmental power to enrich politicians and their billionaire benefactors, to the detriment of the country and the average citizen, has grown to an incomprehensible and uncontainable level. Whether DOGE was a legitimate undertaking by Musk and his tech geniuses to cut wasteful spending and uncover fraud, or nothing more than a PR stunt designed to keep the MAGA army satiated with the appearance of making America great again, it appears to have sunk into the swamps of DC, foiled by the uni-party once again. But the show must go on, and this past week’s episode of “As the Empire Crumbles” was certainly entertaining, with the most powerful politician in the world hurling insults at the richest man in the world, who responded by accusing the president of pedophilia, while calling for his impeachment and the creation of a new political party. The MAGA acolytes were flabbergasted, as their two heroes, who were going to usher in a new golden era, came to blows and have irreconcilably broken up. Who could have predicted that the two biggest egos on the planet would ultimately clash and dissolve their partnership? Many of the twitterati were convinced it was just more 4D chess, just as they believed the Q bullshit during Trump’s first term. The world was captivated and enthralled by this trivial social media war, while NATO/Ukraine desperately attempted to initiate WW3 with their attacks on Russian airbases, the Crimean bridge, and Russian passenger trains. Thousands of tweets and hundreds of articles have been written about this Trump/Musk bickerfest, while the world is imploding and we are accelerating headlong towards a global war, initiated by the three stooges running France, U.K. and Germany, and cheered on by the likes of Lindsey Graham and Mike Pompeo. Trump’s campaign trail promise to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours has proven to be nothing more than his predictable bloviating bullshit. It has become clear he has absolutely no sway over the EU warmongers, or his own Deep State CIA operatives carrying out the attacks on Russia, as his weak and ineffectual efforts to end the conflict start to diminish his presidency from the outset. The Gaza genocide continues, with American financial and military support, even though Trump promised to end that conflict. Iran continues to resist efforts to stop its nuclear enrichment program. China pretends to be negotiating with Trump on tariffs but is content letting the Soros installed leftist judges across the country place roadblock after roadblock in the way of Trump’s tariff, deportation, and governmental downsizing agenda. Foreign leaders know they can wait out all of Trump’s threats by just slow walking negotiations and hoping the Republicans lose the House in 2026. China is biding its time until they believe America is sufficiently preoccupied with its own domestic turmoil and its Ukraine quagmire, and they will initiate their inevitable Taiwan takeover. The United States has not won a war in 80 years and is in no position to wage war in Europe and Asia simultaneously. Trump professes to be for peace, but the Deep State actors controlling the government and the globalist billionaires pulling the strings will force him into WW3. That is how Fourth Turnings roll. With the intense opposition to the Big Beautiful Bill from Musk and key Republicans in the Senate, the next few months could get messy on the fiscal front. Musk is entirely correct, calling the BBB a massive, outrageous, pork-filled disgusting abomination of congressional pork. When the mind numbingly stupid media outlets declare it will add $3 trillion to the national debt over ten years, that means $3 trillion more than the $21 trillion of additional debt already projected. And this assumes no recessions, no financial crisis, no wars, and no fake pandemics. They purposefully give the impression our national debt only goes up by $3 trillion over ten years. I’m absolutely certain the average prole, distracted by their technological bread and circuses, has no clue our debt is on automatic pilot to increase by nearly 70% over the next ten years. The average person remains trapped in a false comfort zone, designed by their overlords, to keep them satiated with toxic foodstuff, propaganda disguised as entertainment, and believing going deeper and deeper into debt, buying trinkets and baubles makes them wealthy. Until that comfort zone is shattered by the bitter reality of the next financial implosion, the masses will do nothing to try and alter the disastrous course plotted by their overlords. The GOP passage of $9.4 billion of DOGE cuts is nothing more than a PR stunt to convince the ignorant masses they are actually doing something about the deficit. The dopes making bets on Draft Kings and posting videos on Instagram have no concept about how ridiculously out of control our government has become. They add $6 billion to the national debt every single day, so their $9.4 of “cuts” will be gone in 37 hours. Our deficits are big, but they are not beautiful. Our deficit in FY24 was $1.8 trillion. Through the first 7 months of FY25 the deficit is $1.049 trillion. At the current rate of spending, the deficit will be $2.2 trillion by the end of the fiscal year. Interest on the national debt is now the second biggest expenditure and has gone from $500 billion during Trump’s first term to $1.3 trillion today. These deficits are clearly unsustainable, and anything which is unsustainable will not be sustained. But the corrupt, captured politicians and insatiably avaricious Wall Street bankers will keep dancing until the music stops. Then they will use their next engineered financial crisis to take more of our money and further restrict our liberties and freedom. CBDCs and social credit scores anyone? The real reason Trump and the GOP need to pass the big beautiful, bloated pig of a bill is because our Ponzi scheme economy depends upon the never-ending issuance of trillions in debt every year to give the fabricated appearance of stability. This is why the GOP applauds Musk’s low hanging fruit DOGE cost savings and ignores them in their outrageously corpulent budget bill. The truth is any actual reduction in government spending (36% of GDP) would ripple through an economy entirely dependent upon government largess and immediately create a massive recession and probable depression. Ponzi schemes have to keep growing until they run out of suckers believing the bullshit underlying the Ponzi. This is where those controlling the levers of society (Bernays’ invisible government) utilize their limitless well of propaganda techniques, technological distractions, and mindless entertainment venues to keep the ignorant masses amused, delusional, and living in denial of the reality staring them in the face. Since the 2008 financial crisis we have been muddling through economically at a 10,000 feet macro level, with periodic crisis episodes (housing collapse, fake pandemic) utilized by the powers that be to issue trillions more debt as the antidote to the initial crisis created by too much debt. At a micro level, the average American has seen a significant decline in their standard of living, as official government reported inflation has eroded 40% of their purchasing power, when in reality they have lost more than 60% of their purchasing power. The reality for the average American prole is debt slavery, either self-imposed to keep up with the Joneses or forced upon them to survive this globalist-imposed death by a thousand cuts economy. Credit card debt of $1.3 trillion is at an all-time high, up $350 billion (35%) since 2020. The average balance on those credit cards is over $7,000 and the average interest rate on those unpaid balances is over 21%. Student loan debt of $1.8 trillion is at an all-time high, up $100 billion since 2020, with over 25% of these loans in default. Auto loan debt of $1.7 trillion is at an all-time high, up $350 billion (27%) since 2020. The average length of these loans is now 70 months. The borrower is underwater by the fifth year of these loans. Shockingly, credit card and auto loan delinquencies have been soaring in the last year, with credit card delinquencies above 3% for the first time since 2012, and auto loan delinquencies surpassed 8% for the first time since 2010. Does that sound like a consumer on solid ground? In addition, the housing market is a disaster looking for a trigger. The Wall Street hedge funds (Blackrock) bought up millions of homes, driving prices 140% (Case Siller Index) higher than the 2012 low, while outstanding mortgage debt has risen from the 2012 low of $13 trillion to $21 trillion today. Prices are ridiculously high and mortgage rates of 7% make it virtually impossible for an average working stiff to buy even a small home. The market is frozen. This is why Trump and his GOP minions must avoid a recession at all costs by continuing to rack up $2 trillion annual deficits. A recession would result in millions of layoffs, which would mean unpaid mortgages, which would mean foreclosures and slashing of home prices, which would trigger housing collapse 2.0, which would turn the recession into a depression, causing a stock market collapse. Now you know why they are desperate to pass this big, beautiful behemoth of bilge. The Fed is in a precarious position of their own making, with all choices pointing towards disastrous outcomes. They are already sitting on over $1 trillion of unrealized bond losses, while their Wall Street owners sit on another $400 billion of unrealized bond losses. If these entities ever have to realize those losses, our entire banking system would collapse. The Fed has cut rates by 1%, but market rates went up, as their power to mislead market players diminishes. They have reduced their balance sheet from $9 trillion to $6.7 trillion. The last time they tried to reduce their balance sheet in 2019, the repo market spasmed and they used the Covid cover to drastically print more fiat. Trump is mocking Powell and demanding interest rate cuts. Powell is pretending to be independent, but he is praying for some kind of crisis to again set the printing presses to hyper-speed. I’m sure the ruling oligarchs are hatching a new crisis to expand their wealth, power, and control, while further impoverishing and enslaving the plebs. It is clear at least to me, we stand on the precipice of an economic conflagration capable of putting the final nail in the coffin of this empire of debt. At the same time there are unrelenting evil forces who are frantically creating the casus-belli to initiate World War III and the massive death and destruction that would produce. The simultaneous commencement of these two events would produce the type of climax expected in the waning years of a Fourth Turning, with a final resolution expected by 2032. Most people are blissfully unaware of the imminent demise of their comfortable existence, so addicted to their techno-gadgets and mindless social media performance art, they are incapable of critical thought regarding the dystopian world they inhabit. “People will come to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think” ― Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death “If politics is like show business, then the idea is not to pursue excellence, clarity or honesty but to appear as if you are, which is another matter altogether.” ― Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death If you ever needed proof politics is nothing but show business, it is this big, beautiful bill episode of drama, fiction, comedy, and tragedy. Excellence, clarity, and honesty have no part in this absurd psychodrama of lies, accusations, and continued downward spiral of this empire of debt. We know Huxley believed the masses could be sufficiently distracted by their own ego driven pursuits, but I don’t think even he realized how much power the technological “advances” of our times (TV based mass media, the internet, corporate/government controlled social media, Big Pharma) would be used by the ruling elite to control, manipulate, sedate, and scare the ignorant masses into voluntary subservience. Everything we are witnessing and living through is nothing more than a theater production, designed by Bernays’ invisible governing authorities to herd us towards their technological gulag, with the slaughterhouse as the other alternative. Huxley’s 1932 dystopian vision, which he believed was more likely than Orwell’s 1949 dystopian vision of the future, and reinforced in a letter to Orwell in 1949 shortly before his death, has been the pre-dominant method used by our overlords to rule over, manipulate, and exploit the foibles of the unthinking masses. They have kept their citizens distracted with pleasures, drugged into passivity, taught to feel rather than think in government run indoctrination centers (public schools) and overloaded with so much useless trivial information, they are incapable of distinguishing between good and evil – actually believing their servitude is freedom. While Huxley’s dystopia continues, the ruling class fears their passive mind control methods aren’t as effective in achieving their great reset agenda, and in need of some Orwellian censorship, disinformation, brute force, government intimidation, harsh mind control, and guaranteeing compliance through fear. Aren’t we lucky to be experiencing the best of both dystopian visions. Those controlling the levers of society have used the school system to create a soulless amalgamation of hedonistic mass consumers; purposeless, apathetic, with muddled brains unable to understand their unintended enslavement to the evil demons running our world and controlling their lives. Knowing most of what we see on our screens and hear from supposed “experts”, left wing corporate media talking heads, and Fox News bimbos, is gibberish and propaganda, it is hard to distinguish real threats from clickbait, purposeful disinformation, and scare tactics designed to make you do what they want you to do. The precarious financial situation of the country is real. The danger from an AI cage built through a tech-state merger with Palantir to surveil and digitally profile everyone is real. The threat of the Ukraine-Russia conflict morphing into WW3 is real. The desire by billionaire globalists to introduce a Great Reset, Great Taking, and CBDCs is real. The planned, funded, and executed invasion of our southern border during the Basement Dummy administration by third world dregs, with the sole intention of destroying the social fabric and finances of the country, run by the Soros/Clinton/Obama triumvirate is real. Even with the dismantling of their USAID insurrection funding source, this week’s festivities in Los Angeles kicked off the summer of civil war. There is nothing real or spontaneous about these riots. Whenever pallets of bricks suddenly show up on streets in city centers, you know Soros and his ilk are behind the organized destruction of that particular city. The brick and bomb throwers are being paid to riot and take photo ops. This will assuredly be rolled out in our other Democrat controlled urban shitholes across the land. The governor of California and the communist mayor of Los Angeles are paid acolytes of Soros, stoking insurrection and should be arrested and thrown into the dungeons of DC, like the grandmothers and patriots who sauntered through the Capitol on January 6. We find ourselves on the precipice of a financial, social, and military calamity, all driven by the three driving forces of this Fourth Turning: debt, civic decay, global disorder. Anyone not noticing events are intensifying, conflict is expanding, anger is building, and the world is accelerating towards that precipice at breakneck speed, is simply ignorant or their minds are so numbed by their i-gadgets and government school indoctrination, that it’s beyond their comprehension to acknowledge reality. At this point in history, I do not believe there are enough awakened critical thinking citizens to make a difference during the waning years of this Fourth Turning. We can’t vote our way out. We likely can’t shoot our way out. We can’t buy our way out. When the majority are proud of their ignorance and believe it is superior to actual knowledge, your society is pretty much screwed. “What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of ‘being informed’ by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information–misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information – information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death The existing financial, social and political paradigms will have to collapse and be swept away for any real change to occur. The problem is it appears that is exactly what the billionaire globalist elite are trying to trigger. In the aftermath, amidst chaos, financial ruin, civil and global war, social strife, and a political vacuum, they envision establishing an authoritarian global world order, with CBDCs, social credit scores, 15-minute cities, and Big Brother level surveillance. If this vision prevails, Orwell wins the award over Huxley for the most accurate dystopian nightmare. Our only hope resides in the hubris and arrogance of the ruling class. Once the collapse is underway, its course is unpredictable and unstable. The best laid plans have a way of going awry. This could offer an opportunity for normal rational people to make their stand. If a liberty movement, backed by the 300 million firearms residing in the red states, could re-ignite the brush fires of freedom in the minds of men, maybe we could reset the course of our country. The odds probably aren’t worse than they were in 1776. At this point, all we can do is prepare mentally, physically, and spiritually for the coming storm. Buy supplies, guns and ammo. And remember what your forefathers accomplished with far less. The choice is slavery or freedom. “It does not take a majority to prevail … but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.” ― Samuel Adams “The time is near at hand which must determine whether Americans are to be free men or slaves.” – George Washington Support the Truth: SEMI-ANNUAL TBP BEG-A-THON Empire Empire Empire Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: The tech job market is rough for entry-level workers right now. Here's how Gen Z is dodging the downtrend.

Time Published: 2025-06-20T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Recent years of rolling layoffs in tech have some Gen Z tech workers stressed — but not deterred. "I feel like everyone feels a bit stressed that there are layoffs," said Merc Heredia-Ferran, a 26-year-old brand marketer at Google who joined the company last year. "I get sent articles that Google laid off people that I didn't even know about, like I'm reading that in the news." The job market has hit Gen Z hard. While older millennials faced higher unemployment rates following the Great Recession compared to Gen Z now, Gen Z experiences unique challenges such as increased Big Tech cost-cutting and AI upending the workplace. BI spoke to more than a dozen Gen Z tech workers and job seekers about their experiences as they hustle to start their careers and as artificial intelligence and changing corporate and immigration policies transform early-career workers' introduction to the workplace. A SignalFire report found that entry-level hiring in Big Tech is down more than 50% from pre-pandemic levels; at startups, it's down more than 30%. The percentage of graduates from top computer science programs employed at Big Tech companies has halved since 2022, the report found. As tech companies pull back hiring across the industry, it's become a tighter job market for Gen Z. The New York Fed reported that unemployment for recent college graduates who majored in computer science was 6.1%, compared to 5.8% for recent college graduates overall. Layoff concerns also weigh heavily in the tech field. Over 28% of job seekers age 18 to 24 and over 21% of those age 25 to 34 say they were laid off in their last job, a ZipRecruiter survey from the first quarter of this year found. Tech still remains a popular career choice for Gen Z in part because of its schedule flexibility, which is prioritized by 90% of graduates, said Sam DeMase, a career expert at ZipRecruiter. Tech jobs often pay more compared to many other careers. "Agencies, you can be cut at any time," Heredia-Ferran said. "You don't even see it coming. Here I feel like, with the high salary, if it happens, I have a cushion now, and the Google name, I can maybe land something if it happens." A software engineer at Amazon says he "got lucky" in landing his full-time job at Amazon. When the 26-year-old India native interned at the e-commerce giant in 2023, the timing was anything but ideal: Their offer coincided with a hiring freeze. "After September 2022, Amazon just stopped hiring interns for that year," the engineer told BI. They completed their internship and received an "inclined to hire" evaluation in August 2023. Due to the freeze, they didn't start their full-time role until June 2024. Compared to the thousands of laid-off employees across tech and at Amazon, among them, peers still looking for work, they're grateful. "I can't give much advice to someone who is looking for a job. I myself can't crack exactly how I landed the job. I just got lucky in that," the engineer said. Expectations don't always match reality. Nearly 40% of rising graduates believe an internship will help them land a job, yet 9% of recent grads said their internships helped them do that, ZipRecruiter found in a 2025 survey of 3,000 recent and rising undergraduate students ZipRecruiter found that rising graduates believe they'll earn a salary of $101,500; recent grads earned an average of $68,400. "The expectation versus reality gap is quite high," said DeMase. If young workers do get the tech job they seek, a complicating factor is the growth of AI. A Hult International Business School survey found 37% of HR leaders say they'd rather use AI than hire a recent graduate. Young workers say AI has helped them and left them feeling uncertain. "In terms of work, it's gotten to a very interesting place because a lot of things that used to take me a day to do, I can now do them in one hour, but that hasn't translated into my work decreasing. It's just more work," the Amazon engineer said. "I don't know if we'll reach the point when AI is doing everything I'm doing and finally replace me," they continued with a nervous laugh. Upon graduation in 2022, Jonathan, a now 26-year-old software engineer, set about applying for tech jobs. He applied to about 300 roles and received 12 responses, some of which were coding tests, before finally landing a full-time job after three months. Nine months later, he was laid off when his tech company closed the office where he was based, meaning he was once again on the job hunt. This time, he applied to about 600 roles, and he heard back from five. "I was talking with some other former classmates and people graduating in the same year," said Jonathan, who asked to withhold his last name due to company policies on speaking with the press. "Most of us were in the same boat. We just graduated, never found anything, and had just gotten laid off from another position. We were all weighing our options. Should we go back and get our master's? It didn't seem like anyone was hiring early-level positions." Tyler Creach, a 26-year-old senior business development manager at software company Freshworks, also said she found the job market difficult before landing her role, which took about four to five months. The tech industry can be "hard to predict" for young people, and it's tough to "see yourself in it for a long time, she said. "Young people are struggling to find stable, relatively well-paying jobs," Creach said. "That's creating a lot of resentment or frustration, possibly from young people. Instead of getting a start right away, they're punting it down the line." The ZipRecruiter survey found that over half of tech job seekers age 25 to 34 and nearly 44% of those age 18 to 24 say they received zero job offers in the past month. ZipRecruiter found that a majority of job seekers in these age demographics say they've been ghosted by an employer during their job search, an experience that has become more common for Gen Z. Over 30% of them say their job search is going "poor" and over half say it's just going "fair." Creach found she had to compromise her job expectations, particularly in location. She previously had all-remote roles and ended up taking a job that required going to an office. She hopes to eventually do something more creative in her career or move into management. "Now it is super difficult to get a job for those remote roles," Creach said. "I had to think about how I could start getting more interviews. Once I started looking at more jobs based in my area, whether hybrid or fully in-office, I started to get more responses and make more progress." Jonathan landed his current job after three to four months. It did require moving states, and he now works in defense tech and not his preferred industry, video games. He says he's trying to get any experience he can. "My dad said when he graduated, it was difficult for him to find a job," Jonathan said. "In the early 90s, there was a mini-recession. To some degree, it has gotten harder over the years to land anything. Everyone tells you to get into computer science. That's where all the money is at, that's where the jobs are at. It's a lot harder than they make it out to be." Despite the job market slowdown, many Gen Z tech workers are still optimistic about working in tech. Justin Dobey, 27, pursued a master's degree in 2020 as the COVID pandemic began. After graduation, his job search just took about a month since there's a "deep lack of electrical engineers" where he lives in South Carolina. He works in a federal government engineering job that has rolled back hiring, though he hasn't been affected by cuts. Dobey said his friends with non-engineering degrees are struggling more to find work than his peers in engineering. "We might not all be in our dream jobs, but they are doing all right, last time I checked." Dobey said he's optimistic about the future of STEM jobs. "If you want to live comfortably and not want to work your whole life like, be a doctor or lawyer, get a STEM degree in computer systems, cybersecurity, AI," he said. DeMase, the ZipRecruiter career expert, said it's important for tech job seekers to learn more about AI and use it ethically. She also advises using their network, getting to know more people in the industry, and tailoring résumés to better align with target roles, which can even include skills from volunteering or part-time work "When folks think about the roles they'll apply for, it's important to lean into their strengths and target roles that are hyperaligned with their superpowers," DeMase said. She also said it's important to speak clearly about the impact they've made in their work or in their projects. "Gen Z approaches the interview as an interrogation rather than a conversation," DeMase said. "It's a conversation, not an interrogation. Come prepared to have an organic chat. Don't be afraid to remember you're interviewing as well." Jump to

InfoQ Homepage Articles Analyzing Apache Kafka Stretch Clusters: WAN Disruptions, Failure Scenarios, and DR Strategies Jun 20, 2025 31 min read by Srikanth Daggumalli Nishchai Jayanna Manjula reviewed by Steef-Jan Wiggers Apache Kafka is a well-known publish-subscribe distributed system widely used across industries for use cases such as log analytics, observability, event-driven architectures, and real-time streaming. Its distribution allows it to become the critical piece or backbone of modern streaming architecture, offering many integrations and supporting near-real-time or real-time latency requirements. Today, Kafka has been offered by major companies as a service, including Confluent Kafka as well as cloud offerings such as Confluent Cloud, AWS Managed Streaming Kafka , Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka, Azure Event Hub for Apache Kafka, etc. Additionally, Kafka has been deployed across over one-hundred-thousand companies, including Fortune 100 across various industry segments such as enterprise, financials, healthcare, automobile, startups, independent software vendors, and retail sectors. The value of the data diminishes over time. Many businesses these days compete in time and demand real-time data processing with millisecond responses to power mission-critical applications. Financial services, e-commerce, IoT, and other latency-sensitive industries require highly available and resilient architectures that can withstand infrastructure failures without impacting business continuity. Companies operating across multiple geographic locations need solutions that provide seamless failover, data consistency, and disaster recovery (DR) capabilities while minimizing operational complexity and cost. One of the common architectural patterns that companies often consider using is a single Kafka cluster spanning multiple data center locations on WAN (Wide Area Network). It is called Stretch Cluster. This pattern is commonly considered by companies for disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA). Stretch Cluster can theoretically provide data redundancy across regions and minimize data loss in the event of a region-wide failure. However, this approach comes with several challenges and trade-offs due to the inherent nature of Kafka and its dependency on network latency, consistency, and partition tolerance in a multi-region setup. In this article, we are going to focus on the stretch cluster architectural pattern for DR or HA-related implications and considerations. The following testing has been conducted, and the cluster behavior has been documented. Below is the high-level view of a single stretch cluster setup that spans across the London and Frankfurt regions with In this use case, we have used a producer written in Java that consistently produces defined (K) Transactions Per Second (aka TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Sample snippets using Kafka performance test api. In this use case, we have used consumers written in Java that consistently consume defined (K) transactions per second (TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Before diving into further discussions and scenario executions, it's crucial to understand the fundamental algorithms of distributed systems. This foundational knowledge will help you better correlate WAN disruptions with their impact on system behavior. CAP Theorem (i.e., Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance) applies to all the distributed systems like Kafka, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, and many others, where data is being distributed across nodes to: Consistency (C) Every read gets the latest write or an error. Availability (A) Every request gets a response, even if some nodes fail. Partition Tolerance (P) The system keeps working despite network issues. Kafka is an AP system; it prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance, while consistency is eventual and tunable via settings. Now, let's get into the scenarios. Before going in-depth into scenarios, let's understand the key components and terminology of Kafka internals. As discussed in earlier sections, in a distributed network setup across geographic locations, network service interruptions can occur because no service guarantees 100% availability. This scenario focuses on WAN disruption between two regions, causing Kafka service unavailability, leaving the cluster with zero active controllers and no self-recovery, even after hours of waiting. Kafka is unavailable and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and reestablishment and shows active controllers as '0' It's a "brain-dead" scenario. Upon WAN disruption, a single 4-node cluster becomes 2 independent clusters, each with 2 nodes. WAN disruption can be done by deleting or modifying route tables. Warning: Deleting a route table may disrupt all traffic in the associated subnets. Instead, consider modifying or detaching the route table. You may need to shut down firewalls Firewall status: systemctl status firewalld Firewall stop: service firewalld stop ZK Server start: bin/zookeeper-server-start etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties ZK Server stop: zookeeper-server-stop ZK Shell commands: bin/zookeeper-shell.sh <zookeeper host>:2181 Active controllers check: get /controller or ls /controller Brokers list: /home/opc/kafka/bin/zookeeper-shell kafkabrokeraddress:2181 <<<"ls /brokers/ids" Alternative to check controllers and brokers in a cluster. Available from kafka 3.7.x bin/kafka-metadata-shell.sh --bootstrap-server <KAFKA_BROKER>:9092 --describe-cluster Kafka is not available and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and re-establishment and shows active controllers as '2' Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own upon and showed active controllers as '0' From the logs, observed disk-related errors and exceptions Logs show that the controller moved the exception from one broker to another broker, but no exit or hang was reported in the logs Controllers '0' behavior is equal to the brain-dead scenario explained in scenario 2. Killing broker and ZK processes (an uncontrolled shutdown can be comparable with machine abrupt reboot) and restarting brokers lead to corrupted indices, rebuilding indices doesn't work even after hours of waiting. This scenario is comparable to an ungraceful shutdown during an environment upgrade or to a poor security posture, where an unauthorized person could terminate the service. Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own. From the logs, 'index corrupted' logs for partitions are shown, and also 'rebuilding indices logs'. Rebuilding indices didn't work and doesn't show any related logs on progress. The resulting cluster is in unavailable status even after 1 hour. Also, it is recommended to do graceful shutdowns instead of using the kill switch or doing abrupt shutdowns so the data in the Kafka local cache will be flushed to the disks by maintaining meta data information and also committing offsets. Deploying on-premise stretch clusters requires a deep understanding of failure scenarios, particularly during network disruptions. Unlike cloud environments, on-premises setups may lack highly available network infrastructure, fault tolerance mechanisms, or dedicated fiber lines, making them more susceptible to outages. In such cases, a Kafka cluster may experience downtime if network connectivity is disrupted. Cloud providers, on the other hand, offer high-bandwidth, low-latency networking over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber connections between regions and data centers. Their managed Kafka services are designed for high availability, typically recommending deployment across multiple zones or regions to withstand zonal failures. Additionally, these services incorporate zone-awareness features, ensuring Kafka data replication occurs across multiple zones, rather than being confined to a single one. It is also important to understand and emphasize the latency impact on a stretch cluster deployed in two different Geo locations with a WAN connection. We can not escape physics; in our case, as per WonderNetwork, the average latency between London and Frankfurt is 14.88 milliseconds for a distance of 636km. So, for mission-critical applications, the setup of a stretch cluster driven by latencies, through testing, is needed to determine how the data is being replicated and consumed across. By understanding these differences, organizations can make informed decisions about whether an on-premise stretch cluster aligns with their availability and resilience requirements or if a cloud-native Kafka deployment is a more suitable alternative. A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is essential for any business to maintain its brand and reputation. Almost all the companies think of High Availability (HA) and Disaster recovery (DR) strategies to meet their BCP. Below are the popular DR Strategies for Kafka. Before we dive deep into DR strategies further, let's understand that the Kafka Mirror Maker 2.0 we are using in the following architectural patterns. There are other components like Kafka Connect, Replicator, etc., offered by Confluent and other cloud services, but they are out of scope for this article. DNS Redirection in Apache Kafka is a cross-cluster replication tool that uses the Kafka Connect framework to replicate topics between clusters, supporting active-active and active-passive setups. It provides automatic consumer group synchronization, offset translation, and failover support for disaster recovery and multi-region architectures. This is a popular DR strategy pattern where there will be two different Kafka clusters, which are of identical size & configuration, deployed in two different Geo regions or Data centers. In this case, it's the London and Frankfurt regions. Usually, Geo location choice depends upon Earth's different tectonic plates, company or country compliance and regulations requirements, and other factors. Out of which only one cluster is active at a given point of time, which receives and serves the clients. As shown in the following picture, Kafka cluster one (KC1) is located in the London region and Kafka cluster two (KC2) is located in the Frankfurt region with the same size and configuration. All the producers are producing data to KC1 (London region cluster), and all consumers are consuming the data from the same cluster. KC2 (Frankfurt region cluster) receives the data from the KC1 cluster through Mirror Maker as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Kafka Active Standby (aka Active Passive) cluster setup with Mirror role In simple terms, we can treat the mirror maker as a combination of producer and consumer, where it consumes the topics from the source cluster KC1 (London region) and produces the data to the destination cluster KC2 (Frankfurt region). During the disaster to the primary/active cluster KC1 (London region), the standby cluster (Frankfurt region) will become active, and all the producers and consumers' traffic redirected to the standby cluster. This can be achieved through DNS redirection via a load balancer in front of Kafka clusters. Fig 2 shows this scenario. Figure 2: Kafka Active Standby setup - Standby cluster becomes active When the London Region KC1 cluster becomes active, we need to set up a mirror maker instance to consume the data from the Frankfurt region cluster and produce back to it to the London region KC1 cluster. This scenario is shown in Fig. 3. It's up to the business to keep the Frankfurt region (KC2) active or promote the London region cluster (KC1) back to primary once the data is fully synced/hydrated to the current state. In some cases, the standby cluster, i.e., the Frankfurt region cluster (KC2), continues to function like an active cluster and the London region cluster (KC1) becomes the standby as well. It is essential to note that RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) values are high compared to the Active-Active setup. Active-standby setup cost is medium to high as we need to maintain the same Kafka clusters in both regions. Figure 3: Kafka Active Standby setup – Standby cluster data sync happening to the KC1 Kafka Mirror Maker Replication Lag (Δ): Let's take a scenario, and it might happen very rarely, where we lose all the cluster completely, including nodes and disks, etc. Where the Active Kafka Cluster (London region - KC1) has 'm' messages, and the mirror maker is consuming and producing to the standby cluster. Due to network latency or consumers & producing process with acknowledgements, the standby cluster (i.e., Frankfurt region - KC2) lags behind and holds only 'n' messages. Which means the delta(\(\Delta\)) is m minus n. \(\Delta = m - n\) where: Due to this replication lag (\(\Delta\)), it will have the following impact on mission-critical applications Potential Message Loss: If a failover occurs before the Standby cluster catches up, some messages (\(\Delta\)) may be missing. Inconsistent Data: Consumers relying on the Standby cluster may process incomplete or outdated data. Delayed Processing: Applications depending on real-time replication may experience latency in data availability. The replication lag concern can be overcome with the Active-Active setup. Just like the Active standby setup, we will have the same Kafka clusters deployed in the London and Frankfurt regions. The producers of the ingestion pipeline will write the data to both clusters at any given point in time. Which is also known as Dual Writes. So, both clusters' data is in sync as shown in Fig. 4. Please note that the ingestion pipeline or producers should have the capability to support dual writes. It is also important to note that these write pipelines should be isolated so that any issue with one cluster should not impact other pipelines or create back pressure and producer latencies. For example, if your use case is log analytics or observability, considering Logstash in your ingestion and creating two separate pipelines within a single or more Logstash instances will act as an isolated pipeline. But only one cluster is active for the consumers at any given point of time. Figure 4: Active-Active setup or Dual writes. In case, as shown in Figure 5, any issues with the one cluster the consumers need to be redirected with DNS redirect and RTO and RPO or SLAs are near zero. Figure 5: Active-Active setup, one cluster is unavailable Once the London cluster is available and becomes active, data can sync back to the London cluster from the Frankfurt cluster using Mirror Maker. As shown in Fig. 6, consumers can be switched back to the London cluster using DNS redirect. Also, it is important to configure consumer groups to start where they left off. During this setup, during the failover, it is important to configure consumers' offset to read the messages from a particular point in time, like reply messages from the last current time minus 15 mins, or set up a mirror maker between active clusters to read 'only' consumer offset topics from the London region cluster and replicate to the Frankfurt region cluster. And during the failure, you can use source.auto.offset.reset=latest to read the data from the latest offsets in the Frankfurt region cluster. If the consumer groups are not properly configured, you may see duplicate messages in your downstream system. So, it's essential to design the downstream to handle duplicate records. For example, if it's an observability use case and if the downstream is OpenSearch, it's good practice to design a unique ID depending on the message timestamp and other parameters like session IDs, etc. So, that duplicate message will overwrite the existing duplicate record and maintain only one record. Figure 6: Active-Active setup cluster syncing data with MirrorMaker Message ordering challenges occur when writing to two clusters simultaneously, messages may arrive in different orders due to network delays between regions. This can be particularly problematic for applications that require strict message ordering. So, it needs to be handled in the data processing time or downstream systems. For example, defining a primary key within the message body timestamp field would order the messages based on timestamps. Data Consistency Issues can occur while establishing dual writes to two different clusters. It requires robust monitoring and reconciliation processes to ensure data integrity across clusters. Because there might be conditions where data might successfully write to one cluster but fail in another, resulting in data inconsistency. Producer complexity is an issue in this active-active setup. Producers need to handle writing to two clusters and manage failures independently for each cluster, so isolation of each pipeline is important. This setup might increase the complexity of the producer applications and require more resources to manage dual writes effectively. There are some agents or tools in the market also as open-source offerings that will provide dual pipeline options such as Elastic Logstash. Consumer group management is complex. Managing consumer offsets across multiple clusters could be challenging, especially during failover scenarios, and can lead to message duplication. Consumer applications or downstream systems need to be designed to handle duplicate messages or implement deduplication logic. Operational Overhead - Running active-active clusters requires sophisticated monitoring tools and increases operational costs significantly. Teams need to maintain detailed runbooks and conduct regular disaster recovery drills to ensure smooth failover processes. Network Latency Considerations- Cross-region network latency and bandwidth costs become critical factors in active-active setups. Reliable network connectivity between regions is essential for maintaining data consistency and managing replication effectively. Backup and restore is a cost-effective architectural pattern compared to Active Standby(AP) or Active Active(AA) DR architectural patterns. It is suitable for non-critical applications with higher RTO and RPO values compared to AA or AP patterns. Backup and restore is a cost-effective option because we need only one Kafka cluster. In case the Kafka cluster is unavailable, the data from the centralized repository can be replayed/restored to the Kafka cluster once it becomes available. In this architectural pattern, shown in Figure 7, all the data will be saved to a persistent location like Amazon S3 or another data lake, where the data can be restored/replayed to the Kafka cluster when the Kafka cluster is available. It is also common to see a new environment of Kafka clusters built together using terraform templates and build a new Kafka cluster and replay data. Figure 7: Backup and restore architectural pattern Recovery time impact is a major consideration; Restoring (aka replaying) large volumes of data to Kafka can take significant time, resulting in a higher RTO. This makes it suitable only for applications that can tolerate longer downtimes. Data consistency challenges are also an issue. When restoring data from backup storage like Amazon S3, maintaining the exact message ordering and partitioning as the original cluster can be challenging. Special attention is needed to ensure data consistency during restoration. Backup performance overhead is a further consideration. Regular backups to external storage can impact the performance of the production cluster. The backup process needs careful scheduling and resource management to minimize impact on production workloads. Storage is key. Managing large volumes of backup data requires effective storage lifecycle policies and controlling costs. Regular cleanup of old backups and efficient storage utilization strategies are essential. Coordination during recovery is mandatory. The recovery process requires careful coordination between backing up offset information and actual messages. Missing either can lead to message loss or duplication during restoration. As we explored earlier, choosing a DR strategy isn't one-size-fits-all, it comes with trade-offs. It often boils down to finding the right balance between what the business needs and what it can afford. The decision usually depends on several factors. SLAs (e.g., 99.99%+ uptime) are pre-defined commitments to uptime and availability. An SLA requiring 99.99% uptime allows only 52.56 minutes of downtime per year. The RTO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable downtime for a system or application after a failure before it causes unacceptable business harm. Knowledge/content/training systems, for example, can expect one hour or more downtime because they are not mission critical. For banking applications, on the other hand, downtime acceptance could be none or a couple of minutes. The RPO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable amount of data loss during a disruptive event, measured in time from the most recent backup. For example, an observability/monitoring application can have the acceptability for losing the past hour whereas a financial application can not tolerate losing a single record of transaction data. Associated costs vary. Higher availability and faster recovery typically come at a higher price. Organizations must weigh their need for uptime and data protection against the financial investment required. References: A round-up of last week’s content on InfoQ sent out every Tuesday.

Posted by Bob Dunn There’s a myth in the tech industry that success is a straight line: get the degree, land the job, climb the ladder, maybe start a startup, and everything falls into place. But as shared by Mendel Kurland on an episode of the series DevPulse: Expanding the Stack,” the truth is anything but linear. Mendel’s story starts with a refreshingly humble admission. He failed out of college, earning what he calls a “0.52 GPA.” Instead of this being the end, it marked an unconventional new beginning. Mendel launched his first startup while scraping by, sleeping in his car with his cats, and building websites for local businesses. The drive to bounce back, hustle through uncertainty, and learn along the way became his greatest assets. Thanks to our sponsor Woo: As a shop owner or site builder, whether you’re just starting or scaling up, WooCommerce makes it simple to build and grow an online store, your way. The podcast episode revisits Mendel’s journey through major players like GoDaddy, Amazon, and DigitalOcean. But what stands out is his advice for anyone feeling stuck: “People unfortunately need resilience right now. They need hustle, and they need to reinvent themselves.” In today’s climate of restructuring and layoffs, Mendel stresses that the key to thriving is not to cling to past successes, but to be willing to try something new, even if it means starting from scratch. Mendel and the hosts emphasize an often-overlooked skill in tech: self-awareness. Whether shifting from coding to consulting, product management to community building, or even just taking a new route to an old job, regularly stepping outside routine and asking, “Does this still fit who I am?” is what separates those who thrive from those who stagnate. For Mendel, reinvention isn’t just about career pivots. It’s about re-examining what brings you fulfillment and finding ways to be useful sometimes in roles you’d never anticipated. As tech rapidly evolves, he advocates exploring adjacent paths, embracing discomfort, and connecting with community. “Progress is always forward and progress is always new,” Mendel says. The people who succeed aren’t guaranteed a path, they’re just better at finding the next one. The episode is a candid conversation about the realities of tech careers, but it’s just as much a call to action for anyone in the WordPress, WooCommerce, or broader tech ecosystem. Reinvention and resilience aren’t reserved for the rare. There are common skills we can all practice: active listening, self-analysis, and genuine curiosity. So, for anyone feeling uncertain about what’s next, remember Mendel’s story: sometimes the best way forward is to pause, reflect, and have the courage to build the future you want, even if it means starting over.

Title: US Banks That Fueled Ireland’s Finance Rebound Face Tariff Angst

(Bloomberg) -- When the US launched sweeping tariffs against trade partners in April, BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink found himself in Ireland, one of the countries with most to lose if US multinationals were forced to curtail their operations overseas. Fink, whose company was in the running for a major contract with the Irish government at the time, toed a careful line, claiming to “understand the logic” of Donald Trump’s move while not agreeing with it, and insisting there “does not need to be a true trade war.” Almost three months on, the Wall Street giants that created thousands of Dublin jobs since Brexit are in a similarly awkward position. They’re trying to balance the challenges created by their own government with the opportunities in a country that depends on US multinationals for more than 10% of its jobs and a big chunk of tax receipts. For now, the banks are hopeful their multinational clients will adapt to the trade uncertainty. “It’s not obvious to me that that falls off a cliff” under the threat of tariffs, says Marc Hussey, the Irish-born JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive who returned home to run the bank’s 1,500-strong Dublin business in 2022. Assuming multinationals “shrink overnight” would be an “extreme view,” Hussey added, and he is “not sensing that from any of our clients.” He continues to see growth in the range of businesses he oversees including a global funds administration center, a workplace solutions business that runs employment share programs across the world and the EMEA hub for Chase payments technology. Ireland remains popular in JPMorgan’s head office too — CEO Jamie Dimon will travel to Dublin next month to speak at an event, his fourth such trip in six years. Almost a decade on from the UK’s Brexit vote that cut off London’s banks from a several markets inside the European Union, Ireland has become a big draw for foreign lenders. They now employ close to 15,000 people, according to a report from the Federation of International Banks in Ireland last month, with firms including JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. leading the way to set up major EU businesses in the country. That choice puts them at the eye of the tariffs storm in a market that has long been heavily exposed to US multinationals, prompting recent warnings about the outlook for the economy and the risk to financial stability. As part of the EU, Ireland’s fate is tied to negotiations with Trump ahead of a July 9 deadline, after which nearly all of the bloc’s imports to the US will be hit with a 50% levy. Across the River Liffey from JPMorgan’s offices, Citi’s 2,900 staff are working across an innovation hub, the group’s EU bank headquarters and an international corporate banking businesses. Citi CEO Jane Fraser was in town a few weeks ago to mark the bank’s 60th anniversary in the nation, and hailed Ireland as “a hub for innovation, a magnet for multinationals and a vital part of the world’s economic landscape.” The bank’s new Dublin office, to be opened next year with space for an extra 400 staff, is “a symbol of our long-term investment in Ireland and in Europe,” she added in a LinkedIn post. Hussey is hoping the move increases the chances of a long-promised footbridge that would link JPMorgan on Dublin’s southside to the northside of the Liffey, where Citi’s new office will join the Central Bank of Ireland’s headquarters. Davinia Conlan, Citi’s Ireland head and chair of industry group FIBI, argues that there is “a lot to be positive about from an Ireland domestic economy perspective” and she is hopeful that Citi will ultimately fill its 3,300 capacity in the new site, though she’s not putting any time line on that. “We’re still expecting the economy to, to grow albeit at a slower pace than we would’ve seen previously,” she said. Wish List Ireland also offers companies the benefit of “ease of access” to government, Conlan said. The Department of Finance will soon launch an industry consultation on its next international financial services strategy, a successor to the Ireland for Finance strategy launched in 2020 which covers banks, insurers, funds and other firms that combined employ around 60,000. Regulatory simplification will be high on the industry’s wish list, Conlan and her peers say, with firms set to call on Ireland to remove some “gold-plating” of EU rules and to push the bloc to be more competitive around regulation. The international banks’ federation, FIBI, is preparing a proposal on simplification which will offer examples of areas where regulation can be “more efficient,” Conlan said, declining to offer goldplating examples before that. Investments in infrastructure and housing, including a long promised airport metro, will also be on the list. Fernando Vicario, who heads Bank of America’s Dublin-based EU head office, is hopeful that imminent reform of the EU’s securitization market will offer a further boost for his 1,300-strong team, which has been retaining its earnings to support future growth. “Ireland can be a place where these securitization deals can be packaged out of Ireland into the rest of Europe,” he said, adding that the country already commands a big presence in this market. Vicario does not expect the Irish government to pivot to protectionist sentiment, which has cropped up in some countries in response to Trump’s trade approach. “I learned in Boston that America is Irish,” says Vicario. “In business, people stick to their positions and do business. And we do business with Irish headquartered companies and with Irish branches and subsidiaries of US companies, all day long. I have quite frankly no problem whatsoever with our passport referring to our US origin.” Ireland has shown it has no problems with US companies either: following Fink’s careful diplomacy, BlackRock was last month named a preferred bidder to help manage the country’s multibillion-euro pension program. --With assistance from Leonard Kehnscherper.

David Sorensen claims Israel's true purpose is to establish Jerusalem as the center of a one-world government, orchestrated by Zionist elites in powerful institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard and global health organizations. Sorensen alleges Israel intentionally fostered Hamas to justify military expansion, citing Netanyahu's 2019 remarks and suspicious IDF security failures during the October 7 attack as evidence of a staged provocation. He traces Israel's origins to the Rothschild family, accusing them of satanic motives symbolized by occult imagery (e.g., the City of London's dragon crest) and hijacking Christianity to serve political Zionism. Sorensen condemns Christian Zionism as a distortion of scripture, arguing that true Israel is spiritual â not a militarized state. He blames elite-funded doctrines (e.g., Scofield Study Bible) for misleading believers. Despite exposing conflict as manufactured, Sorensen envisions Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation and plans a follow-up documentary. His core message urges unity over violence, encouraging resistance against artificial divisions. The Health Ranger Mike Adams sat down withÂ David Sorensen, a missionary journalist and filmmaker behind the documentary "The Mystery of Israel," on the Health Ranger Report. Their conversation delved intoÂ the hidden agendas behind the Israel-Palestine conflict. Sorensen began by elaboratingÂ a globalist plot to establish Jerusalem as the center of a one-world government.Â The founder ofÂ StopWorldControl.comÂ argues that Israel's geopolitical significance extends far beyond its small geographic footprint. He claims that Zionist elites are orchestrating a plan to centralize control in Jerusalem. Many of these elites helm powerful institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard and global health organizations. "The vast majority of people haven't got the slightest clue about the real agenda with Israel â that it's all about establishing a one-world government from within Jerusalem,"Â Sorensen stated. He emphasized that mainstream narratives suppress this truth, labeling dissenters as "antisemitic" to silence criticism. One of the most explosive claims in Sorensen's documentary is that the Palestinian military group Hamas (formally theÂ Islamic Resistance Movement) was deliberately fostered by Israel to justify military expansion. He cited statements from Israeli officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas," the incumbent Israeli leader allegedly said in 2019. "This is part of our strategy." Sorensen also referenced whistleblowers from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who claim that Israel's advanced border security systems inexplicably failed during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack. This raises suspicions of a staged provocation, with the missionary journalist arguing that no military commander in his right mind would carry out such an irrational suicide mission â unless they knew retaliation was part of a larger plan. Israel's Rothschild connection and the role of satanic influence Sorensen traced Israel's origins to the Rothschild family, whom he accused of funding the state's creation as part of a satanic agenda. He pointed to the City of London's crest â featuring two dragons â as symbolic of their allegiance to dark forces. (Related:Â The history of the House ofÂ Rothschild.) "They don't even hide their Satanism,"Â he said, referencing biblical descriptions of the dragon as Satan.Â "The Rothschilds are known to be at the heads of Satanism. They are a very satanic family." A significant portion of the interview focused on Christian Zionism â a movement that unconditionally supports Israel based on theological interpretations. Sorensen added that they have hijacked Christianity to turn believers away from Christ and toward a political, militarized Israel. The filmmaker condemned this ideology as a distortion of scriptureÂ â arguing that true Israel is spiritual, not political as God never promised a military state. Christ fulfilled all prophecies, and His kingdom is within each individual. Sorensen blamed the elite-funded Scofield Study Bible for twisting Christian doctrine to justify Zionist expansion. Despite the grim revelations, Sorensen ended on a hopeful note, sharing a vision of reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. The author and filmmaker mentioned that in a dream, he saw both groups realizing they were the same people who were guilty and needing the forgiveness of God. He added that instead of fighting, they embraced each other which is the message the world needs. Head over to Truth.news for more similar stories.

He traces Israel's origins to the Rothschild family, accusing them of satanic motives symbolized by occult imagery (e.g., the City of London's dragon crest) and hijacking Christianity to serve political Zionism. Sorensen condemns Christian Zionism as a distortion of scripture, arguing that true Israel is spiritual â not a militarized state. He blames elite-funded doctrines (e.g., Scofield Study Bible) for misleading believers.

The Health Ranger Mike Adams sat down withÂ David Sorensen, a missionary journalist and filmmaker behind the documentary "The Mystery of Israel," on the Health Ranger Report. Their conversation delved intoÂ the hidden agendas behind the Israel-Palestine conflict. Sorensen began by elaboratingÂ a globalist plot to establish Jerusalem as the center of a one-world government.Â The founder ofÂ StopWorldControl.comÂ argues that Israel's geopolitical significance extends far beyond its small geographic footprint. He claims that Zionist elites are orchestrating a plan to centralize control in Jerusalem. Many of these elites helm powerful institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard and global health organizations. "The vast majority of people haven't got the slightest clue about the real agenda with Israel â that it's all about establishing a one-world government from within Jerusalem,"Â Sorensen stated. He emphasized that mainstream narratives suppress this truth, labeling dissenters as "antisemitic" to silence criticism. One of the most explosive claims in Sorensen's documentary is that the Palestinian military group Hamas (formally theÂ Islamic Resistance Movement) was deliberately fostered by Israel to justify military expansion. He cited statements from Israeli officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas," the incumbent Israeli leader allegedly said in 2019. "This is part of our strategy." Sorensen also referenced whistleblowers from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who claim that Israel's advanced border security systems inexplicably failed during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack. This raises suspicions of a staged provocation, with the missionary journalist arguing that no military commander in his right mind would carry out such an irrational suicide mission â unless they knew retaliation was part of a larger plan. Israel's Rothschild connection and the role of satanic influence Sorensen traced Israel's origins to the Rothschild family, whom he accused of funding the state's creation as part of a satanic agenda. He pointed to the City of London's crest â featuring two dragons â as symbolic of their allegiance to dark forces. (Related:Â The history of the House ofÂ Rothschild.) "They don't even hide their Satanism,"Â he said, referencing biblical descriptions of the dragon as Satan.Â "The Rothschilds are known to be at the heads of Satanism. They are a very satanic family." A significant portion of the interview focused on Christian Zionism â a movement that unconditionally supports Israel based on theological interpretations. Sorensen added that they have hijacked Christianity to turn believers away from Christ and toward a political, militarized Israel. The filmmaker condemned this ideology as a distortion of scriptureÂ â arguing that true Israel is spiritual, not political as God never promised a military state. Christ fulfilled all prophecies, and His kingdom is within each individual. Sorensen blamed the elite-funded Scofield Study Bible for twisting Christian doctrine to justify Zionist expansion. Despite the grim revelations, Sorensen ended on a hopeful note, sharing a vision of reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. The author and filmmaker mentioned that in a dream, he saw both groups realizing they were the same people who were guilty and needing the forgiveness of God. He added that instead of fighting, they embraced each other which is the message the world needs. Head over to Truth.news for more similar stories.

Title: Could a nuclear war kill crypto? AI predicts Bitcoin’s fate in doomsday scenario
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/could-a-nuclear-war-kill-crypto-ai-predicts-bitcoins-fate-in-doomsday-scenario/
Time Published: 2025-06-20T05:00:41Z

Polymarket odds of a nuclear bomb being dropped in 2025 was 18% – But can BTC survive? Bitcoin [BTC] has a religious following, especially for those who believe it’s a hedge against inflation and political instability, like the ongoing Israel-Iran war. But, what if it cracks in a nuclear doomsday? Many wealthy individuals, like Mexico’s richest man, Ricardo Salinas, and leaders like U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, have embraced BTC and crypto as a hedge. In fact, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, pitches BTC as a hedge equivalent or better than gold. However, AI predicts that the digital gold may not survive a nuclear apocalypse. For starters, it is crucial to understand the Bitcoin network, miners who secure it, and nodes that run the protocol to ensure transaction reliability. As of mid-2025, the network has 22,129 reachable nodes (including mining nodes) spread across the globe. Source: NewHedge According to public and official data, the U.S. controls 10.2% of BTC nodes, followed by Germany (5.8%) and France (2.6%). All the top three are nuclear powers, while China, per official data, owns only 0.15%. However, nearly 64% of nodes remained unaccounted for or unknown. Per ChatGPT, China may be controlling most of these ‘unknown’ nodes, as most of their operators opted for VPNs and went underground after the state banned BTC mining in 2021. Source: ChatGPT In a major conflict wiping out 60-80% of the internet, Bitcoin active nodes could drop from the current 22K to 1K, leading to transaction failure, alongside the proof of work (PoW) consensus. Most of the U.S. and Germany nodes would be offline for an average war, like between Russia and NATO, per ChatGPT predictions. But P2P connections could be resumed in weeks. However, a worldwide nuclear escalation would drive the network into a ‘critical failure state’, and the consensus program would stop. The above war scales and impact on the Bitcoin network would impact BTC’s value differently. But ChatGPT added that BTC pricing will be modified by other factors like market psychology and sentiment. Source: ChatGPT For a confined conflict, BTC could be viewed as a hedge, like the current Israel-Iran war. It has stayed above $100K despite the war rhetoric from leaders, including the U.S. President Donald Trump. In fact, Bitwise’s Head of Alpha Strategies reinforced this stance and recently stated, “This moment (geopolitical tensions) is why Bitcoin exists.” Meanwhile, other analysts, like QCP Capital, warned that a wider regional war could affect oil supply and global inflation, putting BTC at risk. According to ChatGPT, however, such a regional scale, involving nuclear warheads, would lead to price swings with mixed sentiment. However, in a global and total annihilation scenario, food and barter trade will be more valuable, and the internet and BTC will be dead. This is how ChatGPT charted out the above probabilities on the potential price crash for BTC. Source: ChatGPT For a localized attack, the network would remain steady, and the price could dip about 10%-30%. In fact, this is considered a normal pullback during bull markets. Per current prices, that would imply a drop to $98K-$75K. For a regional nuclear war, BTC price would crash 30%-60%, implying a potential dip to $75K-$42K as most nodes go offline. In continent-wide destruction (2-3 powers annihilated), ChatGPT projected a 60-80% decline. That would be a free fall to $42K-20K. This could be a great discount for survivors if Bitcoin survives and rallies above $100K. However, only 1000 nodes could be online, risking a protocol split or fork. But, as a survivor with no internet access, you’ll likely care about food and shelter if the entire world is nuked. In short, BTC would cease to exist as a market asset and probably tank to zero. Overall, BTC could become worthless if nukes destroy the internet and nodes. But ChatGPT highlighted that it could survive only if there is a backup in satellites with enough running nodes to keep it decentralized and secure before full re-connection later on. That said, as of June 2025, there was only an 18% chance of a nuclear bomb going off in 2025. So, it could be too early to put your nuclear war worries on BTC.

Title: Trump Is ‘Flouting the Law’ in Delaying Enforcement of TikTok Ban, Top Senate Democrat Says
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/trump-flouting-law-tiktok-ban-delay-executive-order-1236436409/

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor President Trump on Thursday officially issued his third executive order delaying enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company sells a controlling stake to non-Chinese parties. Democrats said Trump’s action does not have any legal basis. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement after the White House said the president would delay enforcing the TikTok divest-or-ban law: “Once again, the Trump administration is flouting the law and ignoring its own national security findings about the risks posed by a PRC-controlled TikTok,” referring to the People’s Republic of China.

Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) told Axios about Trump’s planned extension in a story published Thursday. “I’m fine with him trying to sell it, that’s fine, but I think at a certain point we’ve got to enforce this law.” Trump on Thursday wrote on Truth Social, “I’ve just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025). Thank you for your attention to this matter!” The White House had previously said he would issue such an order. Trump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies. But after the 2024 election Trump said “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters. The Trump administration has been trying to hammer out a deal that would restructure TikTok U.S.’s operations in a way that would comply with the law — while also being an arrangement the Chinese government will approve. On Thursday, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-California) criticized Trump’s latest delay on the TikTok ban, writing in a post on X, “The law allows only one single extension, so Trump’s failure to enforce it is illegal.” However, in the same post, Sherman incorrectly claimed that “the Chinese owners of TikToK have announced they are buying ‘Trump Coins’ for $300 million,” which he alleged “is just a $300 million bribe that goes right into his pocket.” The official TikTok Policy account on X called out Sherman’s claim as “patently false and irresponsible.” According to a New York Times story published May 13, a company called GD Culture Group, a “struggling technology company that has ties to China and relies on TikTok,” announced that it secured funding “to buy as much as $300 million of $TRUMP, the so-called memecoin marketed by President Trump.” On a post Thursday on X from @TrumpWarRoom (described as “The official War Room account of President Donald J. Trump’s political operation”) about Trump’s latest deferment of enforcing the ban, users added a Community Note (a crowdsourced fact-checking feature of X) pointing out that the president “has no legal authority to extend the deadline another 90 days.” The Community Note cited the Supreme Court’s ruling in TikTok Inc. v. Garland upholding the law, which says: “The Act permits the President to grant a one-time extension of no more than 90 days with respect to the prohibitions’ 270-day effective date.” Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by China-based ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. TikTok said in a statement Thursday, “We are grateful for President Trump’s leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance’s Office.” Warner, in advocating for passage of the TikTok divest-or-ban bill in the Senate in April 2024, said the legislation “goes a long way towards safeguarding our democratic systems from covert foreign influence.” He said Chinese companies like ByteDance “don’t owe their obligation to their customers, or their shareholders, but they owe it to the PRC government.” At a congressional hearing in March 2023, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said, “ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government” and said there is an “inaccurate belief that TikTok’s corporate structure makes it beholden to the Chinese government or that it shares information about U.S. users with the Chinese government. This is emphatically untrue.” ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by global institutional investors including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the U.S. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Microsoft to lay off thousands in July, but don't worry, AI's getting $80 billion

In context: There's been plenty of talk about machines displacing human workers in the AI Age, mainly focusing on direct replacements – computers taking over tasks like design and programming. Meanwhile, spending on AI infrastructure soars as investment in human skills steadily declines. Bloomberg reports that Microsoft is preparing to lay off thousands of workers next month, with most of the cuts expected to hit the company's sales and customer service divisions. It's a jarring move but not an unfamiliar one in tech. What stands out this time is what Microsoft is doing with the money it's saving: pumping an estimated $80 billion into AI infrastructure over the next fiscal year. That number isn't a typo. As Microsoft reshapes its workforce, it's reshaping its balance sheet, too. It's laying off human employees while building new homes for silicon-based replacements – in hyperscale data centers, GPUs, and power-hungry server farms. Microsoft has not explicitly linked the layoffs to AI, but the connection is increasingly difficult to ignore. The company is investing heavily in machine learning capabilities across its entire product line, from Azure to Office. Its partnership with OpenAI and the widespread deployment of Copilot reflect a strategic pivot away from labor-intensive workflows and toward automated solutions. Despite the scale of this shift, Microsoft has offered little public indication that large-scale retraining or internal upskilling efforts are part of its AI strategy. The company clearly has the resources to help employees adapt to an AI-centric future, yet such initiatives are largely absent from its announcements and disclosures. The emphasis so far has been on infrastructure, partnerships, and AI product rollouts – not on preparing its broader workforce for the changes those investments will bring. This approach reflects a broader trend across the tech sector. Companies including Amazon, Duolingo, and Dropbox have all cited AI-driven efficiency gains when announcing workforce reductions. These moves often emphasize shareholder value and operational agility, even as they diminish opportunities for employees to transition into new roles within the organization. Microsoft plans to lay off thousands globally in the coming weeks. While the company has not disclosed exact figures, reports suggest a significant impact on customer-facing teams. These cuts underscore the shift away from labor-intensive roles as Microsoft pivots toward automation and AI-driven services. The contrast is stark: AI receives billions in dedicated capital, while workers get severance packages and uncertain futures. Microsoft isn't just betting on artificial intelligence – it's actively reorganizing its operations around it. This strategy may pay off in the long term, but it highlights a widening gap between investment in automation and support for displaced employees.

Title: Amazon To Cut 1,000 Jobs Due To AI. Now What?

ByEli Amdur ByEli Amdur, Contributor. Giant robot flicking tiny man. Ai technologies and unemployment problem concept. Vector ... More illustration. Earlier this week, Amazon announced it would cut 1,000 jobs due to AI. Is anyone surprised? The monster created by Big Tech has begun rising up to consume its creator. Well, perhaps not totally consume, but the damage done could likely be (a) measurable, (b) a harbinger of things to come at Amazon, and (c) a phenomenon we will see far and wide, not just at Amazon. It’s inescapable for a few reasons. First, according to data from layoffs.fyi, which monitors tech worker layoffs, already this year 141 companies have laid off 62,832 employees. In 2024, it was 152,922 employees from 551 companies and in 2023, it was 264,220 employees from 1,193 companies. Layoffs, we see, are inevitable – especially in tech. At the onset of new technologies or the introduction of new products, hiring takes place with kid-in-a-candy-store concern for consequences. A year later, things look quite different – and that kid is now an obese diabetic. Now, however, we see a direct cause and effect, unmistakenly traceable to AI, because AI has advanced so quickly that it is now capable of doing many of those lower, entry-level jobs we’ve long feared it could do. I am reminded of the classic line from the 1960s comic strip Pogo: “We have met the enemy and it is us.” Make no mistake, though, this is not limited to tech jobs. In May, I posted a column here, “How AI Affects The Socioeconomic Order Of The Workplace” (5/27) and here’s what we saw: Beginner programmers and coders, data analysts, junior paralegals, retail sales associates, content writers, copy editors, graphic artists, and grant writers are among the many who will deal with this reality. There’s more, but space and time have limits here. This phenomenon of jobs being eaten by AI will undoubtedly be seen at all tech companies, as they are the creators of this to begin with. But it will spread elsewhere. Picture lava streaming down an erupting volcano. But there’s a big upside to this. The World Economic Forum predicts that AI will create 78 million jobs, even after job losses are factored in. So, working the math and going with aggregated and widely-accepted estimations that for every job killed by AI three or four will be created, we come to this: 78 million is the WEF’s net number, bringing us to 100 million or more, gross. Thise jobs will just not be the vulnerable entry-level jobs we’ve been discussing here. It’s complicated, no? If I were running a large company, I’d ask for a meeting. In the same room, I’d have the president of the local university or community college, my senator or congressperson, and me. I’d have one item on the agenda: those AI skills we’ve been teaching for our graduates to find their first jobs need to be relegated to high school and forever be seen as obsolete. AI will forever do them. Next, define the next level of AI jobs and teach them as the new entry level, while teaching other skills – communication, critical thinking, problem solving, etc. – that our new employees would have been developing on he way up. We are past throwing our hands in the air. This is no longer something new or mysterious. “Success delayed is success denied,” said Ben Franklin. We just simply must take the first step.

Title: The Big Picture: Streaming and Social Media Climb Amid Traditional Media’s Slow-Motion Breakdown

Time Published: 2025-06-19T17:00:00Z

The headlines all point toward the decline of linear and traditional models, with the nagging question of whether new means of distribution can pick up the slack Traditional media is experiencing what often feels like a slow-motion nervous breakdown, which would hardly come as news to anyone operating in the thick of that. Yet occasionally a week comes along with ostensibly distinct stories that help crystallize the larger picture, almost like the cop finally piecing things together at the end of “The Usual Suspects.” In just the last few days, a handful of reports speak to trends that coalesce into a single clarifying moment: Old media is limping along on wobbly legs, if not its death bed yet, and efforts to save it are merely prolonging the inevitable. A shift in consumption patterns for entertainment, news and information has hamstrung many long-established means of disseminating content, while pushing newer forms to the forefront. Clocking each of these developments as they fly by — sometimes while on the move ourselves, increasingly via our phones — the connections aren’t always obvious. So let’s pause for a breath and take inventory of this week’s media news, and the changing of the guard that it reveals. Part of that shift has been driven by YouTube, and as if on cue: Shorter version: Teens and young adults (especially) are spending less time watching movies and TV shows, while allocating more to snippets of video and getting their news from TikTok, not those stodgy cable networks watched by their parents and grandparents. But wait, there’s more. Netflix unveiled a groundbreaking deal Wednesday to carry the output from French broadcaster TF1, an agreement TF1 Group CEO Rodolphe Belmer described in its announcement as becoming necessary “as viewing habits shift toward on-demand consumption and audience fragmentation increases” — a trend that has crossed international borders. Finally, Amazon issued a memo that served as a not-so-subtle warning to its employees about the impact of artificial intelligence, noting there will be layoffs associated with AI picking up tasks performed by actual humans, while offering the only modestly reassuring aside that some new jobs will be created as a byproduct of that shift. So basically, “Get on board, or get out of the way.” Although frankly, a host of recent headlines have made clear AI’s impact remains unpredictable enough that it won’t necessarily spare early adopters either, in the same way monsters in old movies frequently kill the mad scientist that unleashes them first. The main problem, grappled with since the transition from print to online and more recently the great migration to streaming that began with the launch of multiple services (including Disney+ and Apple TV+) in 2019, is the uncertainty about when these lines will intersect — whether newer revenue streams can supplant old ones, such as linear TV, before those models slide off a cliff. The newspaper industry dealt with that game of digital chicken first, as the web gobbled up its classified advertising business and distribution of print editions, falling victim to those forces despite the alarm bells sounded about trading in “print dollars for digital dimes.” Although most legacy publications have managed to survive, with a few notable exceptions like the New York Times, it’s generally in dramatically scaled-down form, both in terms of the size of their staffs and the scope of their ambitions. Step back a little further, and it’s easy to weave more pixels into the picture, like Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal’s spinoffs of their declining cable assets, and whether the economies of scale associated with mergers and acquisitions can be enough to justify anteing up for an entity whose trend lines point in the wrong direction. In “The Usual Suspects,” the messy cop defends his scattered work area by telling a colleague, “It all makes sense when you look at it right. You gotta stand back from it.” In the daily scramble of these jobs, including the race to cover these stories, it can be difficult to take the time to seek perspective or try connecting the dots, making things appear messier, even chaotic. Whether the view is from up close or gains clarity from far away, though, the prospects for traditional media don’t paint a comforting picture.

Title: How Online Businesses Are Winning Customers With AI Agents In 2025

ByAytekin Tank ByAytekin Tank, Contributor. Photo by Christopher Gower on Unsplash If you scroll through Instagram stories these days, you might notice something: photos of vacations, engagements, and kids’ birthdays are giving way to targeted ads. They’re not there just to spam you—they actually work. The old shopping journey looked like this: need → search → buy. Today, that flow has flipped. People often make purchases without ever intending to shop in the first place. Using the latest technologies, brands match products to individuals, and customers end up buying things they didn’t even know they needed, like a lightweight enamel mug for that camping trip you just booked. Now, AI agents are pushing the next big shift in e-commerce. These tools promise to transform the customer journey yet again. Brands that don’t get on board risk losing valuable opportunities (and sales). The fact is: consumer expectations are evolving. By 2030, over 55% of purchases will be influenced by AI-friendly buyers, according to research from Cognizant. As CEO of a company that builds AI agents—and uses them internally—I’ve seen how powerful they can be. Here’s how your business can tap into them to boost sales and level up the customer experience. Many years ago, when I built my first website, adding e-commerce functionality was a Byzantine process. I needed an experienced web developer to help hammer out the details. Today, platforms like Shopify make it easy and affordable for businesses of any size to sell online. And now, AI agents are making customizable storefronts even more accessible. When you install an agent like Juphy, Smartbot, or Shopify Sidekick, it will train itself using your business’s data. You can decide what the agent does and how it interacts with customers. If you want it to handle customer service, you can assign it a support phone number and instruct it to answer calls. If your business serves multiple countries, your agent can translate webpages and offer support in different languages. You can also choose which pop-ups to display to guide users as they browse and shop. What’s more, you can set it all up without writing a single line of code. A growing number of startups are taking the guesswork out of visual design as well. Phot.AI, for example, is an agent platform that independently handles tasks like image editing and design for e-commerce brands. Its agents learn which designs perform best for different product categories and marketplaces, reducing manual effort and costs for business owners by up to 80%. AI agents are like designing the brick-and-mortar store of your dreams, but without needing an architect or interior designer. AI agents make it easier than ever to design and customize your e-commerce site. But what about the experience on the other side of the screen? Research shows that 75% of buyers find online shopping frustrating. If you’ve ever sworn off e-commerce after a botched return or an endless gift search, you’re not alone. Maybe the shoes you ordered for a wedding arrived two sizes too big, and the return process was cumbersome. Or perhaps you set out to buy your nephew a birthday present and got lost down the rabbit hole of Nintendo Switch options. This is where AI-powered assistants come in. Agents can guide shoppers step-by-step, smoothing over the snags that often jam up the purchase journey. They answer questions, like what to buy, when it will arrive, and whether it fits the budget. And over time, they learn a buyer’s preferences: goals, timing, history, and price sensitivity. For instance, if you need that present for your 12-year-old nephew by Friday, an agent will intuit that a digital gift card to his favorite gaming store, delivered instantly, is the best option. Even if the product search has gone off without a snag, one glitch in the process, like a question or concern that pops up and doesn’t receive immediate attention, can mar the entire experience. As Scott Hendrickson, chief revenue officer of the agentic AI merchant network firmly, recently noted, “What consumers really want is for commerce to happen immediately. People’s time has never been more valuable, and they expect things to be frictionless.” Integrating AI agents into your e-commerce site can help transactions become frictionless. Agents are ready to answer questions around the clock, 24/7. An agent can engage in natural, responsive, human-sounding conversations, ensuring potential customers never slip through the cracks due to unanswered calls. And because they are linked directly to the back-end of your business—data, inventory, and more—you can rest assured that the information it provides will be up-to-date. It won’t offer unrealistic shipping timelines, only to frustrate disappointed customers. It won’t suggest products that aren’t in stock. But if a product is out of stock, it will suggest alternatives based on the buyer’s preferences and history. And as your business grows, agents are a cost-effective solution to help manage all of the business parts that grow in tandem, like more products, more customers, and a higher volume of transactions. In short, AI agents help scale your business, ensuring every customer interaction is fast, informed, and friction-free.

Title: Every fusion startup that has raised over $100M | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines. The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. With a $1.8 billion Series B, Commonwealth Fusion Systems catapulted itself into the pole position in 2021. Since then, the company has been quiet on the fundraising front (no surprise), but it has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor uses a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. In Sparc’s successor, the commercial-scale Arc, heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. Backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others, Devens, Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Arc operational in the early 2030s. The company has raised a total of $2 billion, according to PitchBook. Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. The company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third-decade, General Fusion has raised $440.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In an General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. First Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Title: Microsoft Plans Layoffs Targeting Sales Teams

Microsoft is gearing up for another round of layoffs, with plans to cut thousands of jobs with a specific focus on its sales workforce, according to people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg reports that technology giant Microsoft is preparing to trim its workforce once again, with the latest round of job cuts expected to be announced in early July, following the close of the company’s fiscal year. Sources close to the situation revealed that the layoffs will predominantly impact sales positions, although other teams may also be affected. The exact timing of the announcement could still change. This news comes on the heels of a previous wave of layoffs in May, which involved 6,000 employees losing their jobs, primarily in product and engineering roles. The customer-facing positions, such as sales and marketing, were largely spared during that round of cuts. In April, Microsoft informed employees of its intention to rely more heavily on third-party firms for the sale of software to small and medium-sized businesses, potentially foreshadowing the upcoming reductions in the sales force. As Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, spending tens of billions of dollars on servers and data centers, executives have pledged to Wall Street and cautioned employees that the company will maintain a tight grip on spending in other areas. The company has stated that it regularly assesses its organizational structure to ensure it is allocating resources effectively for growth. At the end of June 2024, Microsoft had a total of 228,000 employees, with 45,000 of them working in sales and marketing positions. The company has a history of restructuring teams and announcing other organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. Breitbart News previously reported on a significant layoff in January that impacted the company’s security division: One of the individuals with knowledge of the situation revealed that employees in Microsoft’s security unit began receiving notifications about the layoffs on Tuesday. The security division is led by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon who made a surprising move to Microsoft in 2021 to spearhead a revamped cybersecurity effort.

Title: I'm a former Amazon developer. Jassy's memo doesn't surprise me, and I don't think engineers should worry about their jobs.

Time Published: 2025-06-19T13:29:05Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 30-year-old Shahad Ishraq, from Germany. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Reading Andy Jassy's new memo on generative AI, I'm not surprised by anything. I worked at Amazon for nearly 3 ½ years and left in late May because of the five-day return-to-office mandate. My commute took an hour and a half each way, so I wanted to move to another job where I could still see my career progressing and do interesting work. The memo feels consistent with what I'd been hearing from management and Jassy while working at Amazon. I think Jassy's comments are to show shareholders he's invested in the technology. I initially worried about AI when I wasn't as familiar with the products. However, using AI will give you a better understanding of what it's capable of and what skills you can develop to differentiate yourself. I joined Amazon in 2022 as a systems development engineer, working in Leipzig, Germany. My day-to-day work involved designing and implementing software and performing operational tasks. When AI tools first came out a few years ago, we were told we could use them, but we should be very careful and follow the company's policies on their usage. Amazon is a huge company. Within it, I spotted and heard about different approaches to AI adoption. There seemed to be a bunch of excited early adopters who shared their findings with everyone. There were people like me who followed the first bunch and saw what went well. There were also some skeptics and a small number of engineers who were outright against using AI. For me, the dawn of AI was a bit scary at first. Everyone was saying it would put me out of a job. Unless you test the technology yourself and see what it can do, you'll fear the unknown. AI wasn't part of my job until sometime in 2024. There were also some barriers to using the technology. When I first joined Amazon, ChatGPT wasn't even available, but when it did come out in 2022, we couldn't use it that extensively because of data security issues that come with copying our code into those models. When Anthropic's Claude became available within Amazon Bedrock — the company's internal service for developing generative AI applications — we were able to make more use of AI. In my last few months at Amazon, I started experimenting a lot with approved AI tools, doing extensive tests with them. They don't do everything for me, but I've integrated these tools into my workflow, such as by asking it to create a plan for my tasks or spot differences between documents. I noticed it often fails, and I have to make changes, but overall, it has improved my speed and increased my throughput significantly. Andy Jassy's memo feels very consistent with what I've been told internally before I left Amazon and what the company has communicated publicly. News articles talking about the memo focus on Jassy saying that a lot of jobs will be taken by AI. However, in the same sentence, he also says jobs will be created. I've tried creating production-level applications using AI, and it takes a lot of effort to get these products ready. A company like Amazon can't roll out an application that breaks and causes havoc. They have to have firewalls, checks, and tests. I don't see people going out of jobs in huge numbers soon. Amazon went on a hiring spree during COVID. If we see more layoffs, I think it will be associated with cutting back after that spree, rather than the impacts of AI. AI agents are helping out software engineers a lot, and the amount of work agents do will probably increase gradually. I'm able to get agents working on three different things, while I look into other tasks. But AI hallucinates quite a lot. It does things it's not asked to do. I often have to correct an AI agent producing code. Humans will be required to build guardrails and act as guardrails themselves. Implementing these guardrails will take time, and I think this will slow down the AI agent hype. I think Jassy's comments about AI are to show shareholders he's invested in the technology. Memos have to come out. Jassy has to place a lot of optimism around AI; otherwise, shareholders will think they're not doing anything with AI. My advice to Amazon employees is to start using AI as much as possible to overcome their fear of the unknown. I now work as a software engineer at a utilities company. The more I've been using AI, the more comfortable I feel about myself. I can see what skills I have that I can use to stay relevant. In tech, languages and developments come really fast. My guess is that people will need to use AI to write code and increase their throughput, and pure software engineers will gradually be replaced by people who have both software engineering and AI skills. I'm personally trying to learn these skills because I think they'll become more important. A spokesperson for Amazon told Business Insider: "Amazon employees use internal generative AI tools every day to innovate on behalf of our customers. We have safeguards in place for employee use of these technologies, including restrictions on sharing confidential information with third-party generative AI services."

Title: America Plants The Flag As The Crypto Capital Of The World
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2025/06/19/america-plants-the-flag-as-the-crypto-capital-of-the-world/

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. The US plants the crypto flag America is rapidly emerging as the “crypto capital of the world” since Donald Trump won the presidential election and adopted pro-crypto policies. Such a crypto-friendly ecosystem is propelling American companies to further champion and develop innovative DeFi products and expand their investor base into larger pools of global institutional capital. This week the Senate approved the GENIUS Act, groundbreaking stablecoin legislation, by 68-30 votes, a convincing margin that signals deeper than expected bipartisan support towards good crypto and digital assets legislation and signalling America’s political commitment to digital innovation in the finance sector. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and one of the key sponsors of the bill, said in a statement, “The GENIUS Act will protect consumers, enable responsible innovation, and safeguard the dominance of the U.S. dollar.” It is considered by many market pundits that U.S. dollar backed stablecoins will defend and even extend the dollar’s dominance just as it is in the spotlight with central bankers from Europe to China expressing their views on new challenges to dollar dominance. The prospect of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations has been mooted, and asset owners outside of the U.S. now publicly admit they have been overweight in their U.S. equity and debt positions for more than a decade of solid U.S. market performance, driven by U.S. technology over the past 20 years like the MAG7. Now, new digital asset innovators are leading the way. Circle’s IPO earlier this month debuted on NYSE at $31 and is now trading at over $200, a breathtaking performance, helping to break trail for crypto companies lining up to IPO including Kraken and Bullish. The crypto treasury playbook, made famous by Michael Saylor at Strategy (MSTR) has also seen a number IPOs including Sol Strategies Inc. (HODL.CN), DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV), Upexi (UPXI), Metaplanet Inc. (MTPLF) and many more. These “pubcos” are a niche class of publicly-traded companies available to all investors which serve as proxies by investing in major tokens like bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force organized its last roundtable on June 9, titled “DeFi and the American Spirit.” The SEC Chairman, Paul S. Atkins’s comments at the event have drawn widespread attention for aligning DeFi’s philosophy with American values. Atkins said, “The American values of economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation are in the DNA of the DeFi movement, and importantly, the right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a foundational American value that should not disappear when one logs onto the internet.” He further added, “I am in favor of affording greater flexibility to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, especially when intermediation imposes unnecessary transaction costs or restricts the ability to engage in staking and other on-chain activities.” According to Statista, the United States generates the highest revenue in the DeFi market globally, with an annual growth rate of 3.59%. Atkins’s positive sentiment toward DeFi and positioning it at the core of America’s value system will provide a further boost to the industry. Wendy Fu, ceo and co-founder at Momentum and a founding member of the Libra project at Meta said, “The SEC Chair’s statements at the roundtable have provided a much-needed regulatory clarity to DeFi protocols, but this is just the beginning. Atkins’s statements also reflect the SEC’s ‘century-old regulatory frameworks’ are out of sync with current innovations and require further updates to suit DeFi’s needs.” Currently, the SEC’s rules are based on traditional “issuers and intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, advisers, exchanges, and clearing agencies.” The drafters of such regulations didn’t consider how self-executing software code like DeFi’s smart contracts would eventually displace the intermediaries. Paul Atkins has asked the SEC staff to explore amendments, seek guidance, and frame rules that may be necessary for new companies to comply. This will “eliminate economic frictions, increase capital efficiency, enable new types of financial products, and enhance liquidity.” The SEC’s DeFi roundtable has supercharged the DeFi sector with tokens like Compound (COMP), Uniswap (UNI), and Aave (AAVE) surging in prices. Besides DeFi’s bullish momentum, crypto companies and legacy firms are exploring IPOs and Bitcoin treasuries to diversify their balance sheets and onboard new investors. On March 6, 2025, US President Donald Trump passed an executive order for the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a United States Digital Asset Stockpile. This gave a massive boost to private companies to establish Bitcoin corporate treasuries (BCTs), functioning as acquisition vehicles and operating companies. But companies must assess whether they want to accumulate USD or BTC to customize their trading and Bitcoin retention approach. Companies holding substantial BTC reserves diversify their offerings, such as Strategy rolling out debt and convertible instruments to address different capital markets investors. A BTC pubco’s goal is to generate a strong derivatives market with sufficient volume to offer low-risk participation for institutional investors. For fixed income and private credit companies, a derivatives market facilitates purchasing debt and capturing delta using short futures and options to offset long exposure. For example, Strategy deployed this combination to ensure a fundraising success with 0% debt. Similarly, companies like Nakamoto raised $710 million for their Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) because the company wants to launch more pubcos globally. Nakamoto follows Strategy’s business plans and has been involved with Metaplanet and other listed companies. This enables Nakamoto to offer efficient centralized services and tap into foreign capital markets that have limitations in accessing other BCTs. Since adopting BCT, Strategy’s stock has gained 2,800% with a market capitalization of almost $102 billion. On the other hand, crypto-native companies like Circle have recently forayed into the public markets, making a strong debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 5, 2025. Circle’s shares jumped 235% on the first trading session as the company’s market performance indicates a growing appetite for stablecoins. Amidst massive investor interest, Circle upsized its IPO to $1.05 billion and sold 34 million shares at $31 each. Naman Kabra, founder and ceo of NodeOps, reacted to the market performance, explaining, “Circle's IPO success shows investors and users care about crypto’s real-world use cases and will actively participate if it makes sense to them. Thus, it’s our responsibility to build robust infrastructure, but abstract the technology away from users, so they can only focus on usability.” Public markets are ready for crypto-native companies demonstrating strong revenue charts, robust compliance, and scalable infrastructure. It’s high time we focus on developing cost-efficient, low-latency infrastructure that suits the needs and demands of investors. No wonder popular crypto exchanges like Kraken are preparing for their IPO in 2026 after the SEC dropped its case against them. But Kraken is already reaching out to retail investors by offering tokenized RWAs to US and non-US investors. Since April 14, 2025, Kraken has enabled exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and tokenized stock trading to US clients from select states. But it is now planning to offer tokenized American stocks to non-US customers, thereby opening up investments in traditional assets via tokenization. The RWA tokenization market has grown massively and is projected to reach $30 trillion by 2030. Kraken’s set of microservices aims to take on larger brokerages like Robinhood, as institutional and retail interest continues to surge. According to a recent World Economic Forum report, Ripple and XRP Ledger (XRPL) will also play an important role in tokenizing private equity (PE). The report cites the $1 billion tokenized PE and debt fund launched on XRP Ledger by Aurum Equity Partners to demonstrate how tokenization will improve the efficiency and accessibility of traditional assets. Unique Divine, co-founder and ceo at Nibiru says, “RWA tokenization isn’t simply theoretical. The RWA market has already grown from $8.6 billion in 2024 to over $24 billion in one year, driven by demand for more efficient access to yield-bearing assets. And giant institutions like BlackRock are taking it seriously." The U.S. federal government has already laid the groundwork to develop innovative crypto products with an accommodating and regulatory-friendly approach. With a new Markets Structure Bill in the making, the U.S. is likely to write the playbook for digital assets, and in a shorter period of time than other jurisdictions. Now it’s time for crypto companies to leverage the opportunity and break out of their bubble to bring new investors into the crypto industry and greater market access to products that have shown a firm demand across all segments of the market.

Amazon updates its office-working policy once again When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon is requiring some corporate workers to relocate closer to their managers and teams, targeting cities like Seattle, Arlington and Washington DC (via Bloomberg). The report notes thousands of employees could be forced to move from across various teams, however the company's famously vocal workers are understandably frustrated with the decision. Amazon has been reassessing where employees work for several months, with the company's leader publicly advocating for office-based working. Although relocating isn't always a problem for new starters, many mid-career workers are hesitant to move due to personal and financial challenges – a move would mean uprooting families, children switching schools and partners seeking other jobs. The report suggests that workers have 30 days to decide, followed by a 60-day period to relocate or resign. It also claims that those who refuse to relocate will not be receiving severance packages. Amazon contested this, adding that teammates will receive relocation support, and that timelines for relocations could vary by case. Amazon's relocation trend has already been ongoing for more than a year, with CEO Andy Jassy previously claiming that in-person working boost ad-hoc interactions and, therefore, productivity. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! "We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another," Jassy said. Amazon now requires workers to come to the office five days per week, but that policy got delayed at the end of 2024 due to a lack of readiness – there simply weren't enough desks. "We hear from the majority of our teammates that they love the energy from being located together, and whenever someone chooses to or is asked to relocate, we work with them to offer support based on their individual circumstances," a company spokesperson stated. Some workers worry that the policy shift could be an effort to push workers away from the company – although thousands lost their jobs in 2022 and 2023, Amazon's layoffs in the years that followed have been relatively small (compared with other giants in the industry). An Amazon spokesperson stressed that the policy is not new, but that it's taking a team-by-team approach to in-office working, and that relative to the number of workers the company has overall, the proportion affected is small.

Title: Microsoft to cut thousands more jobs, mainly in sales

Time Published: 2025-06-19T11:50:42Z

Microsoft is set to cut thousands of jobs, mainly in sales, amid growing fears that AI advances are accelerating the replacement of human roles across the industry, Bloomberg reports. The cuts follow a previous round in May, which saw approximately 6,000 roles eliminated. Microsoft has been ramping up its AI investments to strengthen its position as enterprises across industries rush to integrate the technology into their operations. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to spend around $80 billion in fiscal 2025, largely on building data centers to support AI training and cloud-based applications. Adding to industry unease, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week that generative AI and AI agents are expected to shrink the company’s corporate workforce over time. AI is being used as an excuse for layoffs this year, but there may be more to it than what meets the eye. “One, we are still rebalancing employee counts from the over-hiring of the past decade,” said Hyoun Park, CEO and chief analyst of Amalgam Insights. “Tech companies were hiring with the assumption that they would grow at ridiculous rates that have not come to pass. Also, some tech companies think they can simply get rid of salespeople, especially in cash-cow industries where renewals seem to come in with little to no effort. Whether that is actually true or not, we are about to find out.”The job cuts may also signal concerns about the near-term revenue potential of AI, Park said. While Microsoft is under pressure to invest heavily in AI to sustain its stock valuation, it may be turning to short-term operating expense reductions to support its financial performance. “The planned $80 billion investment in AI infrastructure is especially interesting because those numbers assume a massive number of people will adopt Microsoft-related AI products,” Park said. “Are 50 million+ people willing to pay an additional amount on Microsoft products to support AI? That is a massive bet that has been completely unjustified by the current AI market today.”Others point out that the company is betting on a long-term inflection in enterprise workload patterns driven by GenAI, but current adoption patterns remain volatile. “Reports of Microsoft pausing or renegotiating data center leases reflect a prudent but necessary response to these uncertainties,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. “If workloads fail to scale or regulatory barriers increase, Microsoft, and by extension, other hyperscalers, could face underutilized infrastructure, prompting pricing recalibrations or service tier stratification.” The focus on sales roles in the planned cuts is notable, with analysts saying it reflects a broader shift in how enterprise sales functions are evolving. “The rise of AI copilots, telemetry-rich self-service portals, and data-driven journey mapping is reducing the need for large in-region sales teams,” Gogia said. “Microsoft’s realignment is part of a broader pattern also visible in Amazon, Google, and Salesforce.” However, while AI can personalize interactions at scale, it lacks the relational depth required in strategic deal-making, compliance negotiation, and multi-stakeholder orchestration, Gogia added.

Title: Microsoft Reportedly Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs Next Month

Microsoft is planning to cut thousands of jobs in the next few weeks, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the plans. Details about the layoffs are scarce, but Bloomberg says it will be announced early next month once Microsoft’s fiscal year ends. The cuts will impact multiple departments, but Microsoft's sales team is expected to take the biggest hit. The report arrives just a month after Microsoft removed 6,000 jobs across various departments and seniority levels. It was done to reduce management layers and “best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” Microsoft said at the time. As of June 2024, Microsoft had 228,000 employees, and 45,000 of them were in sales and marketing. According to Bloomberg, the previous round of layoffs had largely left the sales and marketing teams untouched. In April, however, the company informed employees that it plans to use third-party firms for the marketing of software to small and mid-size customers. This strategy could help Microsoft reduce operational costs by relying on gig workers for short-term campaigns instead of full-time staff. Microsoft has also vowed to invest over $80 billion in data centers for AI development, but it’s unclear if that has anything to do with the back-to-back layoffs. The months ahead may be tough for tech workers, with more layoffs looming across major firms. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just announced that AI agents will replace a considerable number of jobs at the online retailer. Intel is also planning to lay off 15-20% of its factory workforce amid financial struggles.

Title: Canadian Pension Doubles Down on Green Investing With $400 Billion Pledge

(Bloomberg) -- La Caisse, one of Canada’s largest institutional investors, is doubling down on its sustainable investing targets after meeting its goals for this year earlier than expected. The pension fund, whose full name is Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, pledged on Thursday to invest $400 billion by the end of the decade in companies committed to decarbonizing their operations and in climate solutions such as low-carbon technologies. “We are reaffirming our sustainable investing convictions because they are at the heart of our fiduciary responsibility,” Charles Emond, president and chief executive officer of La Caisse, said in a statement. La Caisse is encouraging companies it invests in to adopt “clear and credible” decarbonization plans “with a view to long-term value creation and sound risk management for our depositors,” he said. The decision comes amid a fraught political backdrop for sustainable investing. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board has dropped its pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and Royal Bank of Canada scrapped its sustainable finance commitments in April, just months after leaving the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. As recently as last week, BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, said it will shut several US-based sustainable funds. Political support for fossil fuels in Canada means pension funds “will be challenged in their efforts to make smart investment decisions” that account for risks from oil and gas, Shift, a sustainable investment advocacy group, wrote in its quarterly pension report. Bertrand Millot, the head of sustainability at La Caisse, said in an interview that its strategy is rooted in financial rather than altruistic motivations. “We aren’t doing this to save the planet. We are doing this to make money. That is very, very important,” Millot said. There is reason to be bullish about the long-term value of the energy transition, according to Vinay Shandal, global head of sustainable investing at Boston Consulting Group. That’s because it isn’t only important from a climate perspective; it’s also a driver of energy security, industrial competitiveness and access to critical minerals, he said. La Caisse isn’t alone in Canada in sticking with sustainable investments: Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board said it’s moving ahead with its long-term objective of achieving net zero emissions from its investment activities by 2050. Ontario Municipal Employees’ Retirement System said it’s committed to annual measuring and reporting on its path to net zero by 2050. At British Columbia Investment Management Corp., climate change considerations remain a cornerstone of the investment process, said Jennifer Coulson, BCI’s global head of ESG. “As one of Canada’s largest institutional investors, we continue to leverage our size and ownership rights to actively manage climate-related risks and opportunities in our portfolio, including through engagement, proxy voting, and policy advocacy,” she said.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethmatlins/2025/06/19/the-2025-forbes-worlds-most-influential-cmos-list/
Time Published: 2025-06-19T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With an unusually broad “super function” remit spanning marketing, product design, UX, go-to-market, creative, communications, research and insights, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion. Michelle Graham Clare With oversight of the iconic brand’s international marketing (i.e., outside the U.S.), Graham-Clare’s influence and remit extend across creative strategy, brand development and customer engagement for the world’s largest QSR company by market valuation. Over the past year, Graham-Clare has launched another chapter in the company’s fan-first strategy and platform, “Only at McDonald’s,” the global evolution of a U.K. campaign celebrating real customer rituals, and which has since inspired activations in Canada, Germany, and Australia. Under her marketing leadership, culturally attuned work like the U.K.’s “Gift of McDonald’s” holiday spot—directed by Gold Lion award-winner and Danish film-maker Nicolai Fuglsig—was named one of best campaigns of the year, showcasing how locally rooted storytelling can elevate brand meaning and emotional connection at scale. Beyond brand building, Graham-Clare is scaling loyalty and digital engagement through app-based experiences, limited-edition merch drops, and real-time activations meeting customers where they are. Graham-Clare is helping ensure that the iconic global brand stays emotionally relevant, digitally fluent, and locally loved. As of June 6, the company’s stock is up nearly 20% YoY. Charlie Smith Smith’s influence is redefining what luxury marketing looks and sounds like in the modern age—and how luxury brands behave across culture. In steering the LVMH-owned Spanish fashion house (and one of the world’s oldest luxury brands) into a new era, Smith is elevating Loewe’s profile and creating a new playbook for luxury storytelling, blending high-craft heritage with an internet-native wit not typical for luxury brands. Under his marketing leadership, Loewe has become one of fashion’s most digitally fluent and culturally resonant brands, known as much for its ironic tone and sharp social media presence as for its meticulous craftsmanship and bold creative direction. Smith oversees all aspects of Loewe’s brand and consumer communication, leading a global team across marketing, digital, PR, events and celebrity/influencer strategy. His remit spans traditional brand building and future-facing cultural invention — from the recent Crafted World exhibition in Tokyo (a multi-sensory showcase of Loewe’s craftsmanship that drew tens of thousands of reservations in days) to the brand’s viral TikTok strategy, which has attracted a new generation of fans. Loewe’s campaigns now regularly feature a mix of high-fashion polish and unexpected levity, including casting creators and memes alongside red-carpet celebrities, resulting in both virality and brand heat. The impact has been both reputational and financial: Loewe is one of the fastest-growing brands in the LVMH portfolio and, in the first quarter of 2025, sat atop the influential Lyst Index. Cristina Diezhandino With global oversight of marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the world’s fourth-largest alcohol and spirits company (based on market capitalization), Diezhandino’s influence is shaping the trajectory of over 200 brands sold in over 180 countries across the company’s portfolio. Over the past year, and as the category continues to shift and respond to forces ranging from changing consumption behaviors amongst younger generations to tariffs, Diezhandino has reorganized her global team into agile brand communities built for experimentation and speed. Over the past year, to accelerate brand and volume growth in the premium sector, Diezhandino has launched the Diageo Luxury Group to unify its high-end spirits portfolio and drive brand and strategic consistency globally. She has also introduced a virtual studio to better scale content and creative production, while also leading Diageo’s largest-ever consumer data initiative and establishing a global partnerships lab to unlock untapped growth through cultural collaborations. Guided by a mindset of possibility and a belief in progress over perfection, Diezhandino is reshaping how her teams understand and influence the future of socializing, long a category reference point, placing celebrations and cultural relevance at the center of every brand experience. Under her marketing leadership, inclusivity has become a hallmark of brand storytelling so to better reflect a more representative vision of modern drinkers. Nicole-Hubbard-Graham Since rejoining Nike in early 2024, Graham has led the brand’s marketing revival at a moment of existential reckoning. After years of revenue declines, stalled innovation, and an overcorrection toward direct-to-consumer sales and performance marketing, Nike is reorienting around brand storytelling, and Graham has been central to that pivot. She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years. The work marked a decisive shift back to the brand’s competitive DNA, earning widespread acclaim and restoring creative credibility. In May, Graham was promoted to EVP and CMO, expanding her remit to include oversight of storytelling across the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. She’s also deepening integration with product and design teams to reestablish cultural heat across categories. While Nike continues to face headwinds, recent campaigns have fueled renewed consumer engagement and helped slow its stock’s decline following years of erosion under previous leadership. In Q2 FY25, the company beat earnings expectations and maintained strong margins, signaling early momentum in its turnaround strategy.

He oversees marketing for all five beverage categories, along with Human Insights, Integrated Marketing Experience (IMX), Marketing Operations & Capabilities, and Marketing Performance. Over the past year, Arroyo has accelerated Coca-Cola’s transformation into a data-powered, AI-enabled marketing engine designed for speed, scale and connection with modern consumers. Focused on driving increased brand strength and creative innovation, the company now delivers personalized, real-time content, powering global efforts like the 2025 return of “Share a Coke,” refreshed for Gen Z, and large-scale activations across Asia-Pacific for Lunar New Year. Campaigns like “Shades of Red” in Mexico—honoring Coca-Cola’s century-long partnership with local small businesses—and Powerade’s “Pause is Power” films, starring Spanish and Brazilian soccer stars Lamine Yamal and Rodrygo Goes, reflect Arroyo’s emphasis on human-centered storytelling that connects globally and hyper-locally.

Over the past year, Delhoume-Debreu played a pivotal role in activating the Group’s unexpected and pioneering Paris 2024 Olympics sponsorship, transforming the Olympics into a global luxury showcase and bringing its “Art of Crafting Dreams” ethos to life through headline-making moments like Dior-designed performance outfits, Louis Vuitton-crafted medal trays, and Moët Hennessy activations across hospitality spaces. Just as influential is her commitment to innovation and sustainability, and her leadership of the LVMH Innovation Award. She is also helping shape how LVMH’s maisons respond to macroeconomic turbulence, empowering each brand to lean into creating desirability and distinction and never discounting. Her work is less about uniformity and more about cultivating excellence through shared creative intelligence, enabling legacy brands like Dior and established acquisitions like Tiffany & Co. to evolve without losing their identity. Esi Eggleston Bracey Eggleston Bracey oversees marketing for a global portfolio of more than 400 brands—including icons like Dove, Hellmann’s, and Magnum—for the world’s fourth-largest fast-moving consumer goods company. With a remit spanning marketing, innovation and category growth, Eggleston Bracey’s influence is central to Unilever’s shift toward building brands that sit at the intersection of personal care, wellness and sustainability. Bracey’s helped accelerate Unilever’s adoption of AI-powered “digital twins”—virtual replicas of products used to simulate packaging, claims, and creative in-market before launch—cutting production costs by up to 55% and slashing campaign development timelines by 65%. This tech-forward pivot is freeing creative teams to focus on high-impact storytelling while ensuring consistency, speed and cost-efficiency at scale. Bracey also introduced and scaled Unilever’s new “Culture to Cart” strategy—an end-to-end approach that fuses brand storytelling with frictionless commerce. The model is designed to convert cultural moments directly into sales by linking campaigns to omnichannel buying paths. Recent executions include Dove’s Serum Shower launch, which paired wellness influencers with live-streamed tutorials and one-click product links; and Hellmann’s 2025 U.S. Super Bowl campaign, extending a broadcast ad to interactive recipe content, TikTok partnerships and integrations on Instacart, Walmart and Amazon.

A new global brand platform, and the work of bringing it to life, emphasize the Indian multinational’s commitment to trustworthy, responsible innovation. This is an especially pointed stance as generative AI continues to shake industries, practices and, in some instances, confidence across sectors. Beyond positioning the enterprise for growth, Virmani is scaling the company’s presence in cultural arenas that intersect with its tech-forward ethos.

Focused reestablishing the company’s brands as category leaders by modernizing its marketing engine and balancing emotional relevance with everyday utility, Kaplan oversees media and digital efforts, including the in-house content studio, "The Kitchen," and managing strategic innovation partnerships with NotCo and Just Spices. In the past year, he spearheaded one of Kraft Mac & Cheese’s most buzzworthy campaigns to date: a limited-edition “Forever Macaroni Necklace” made of 14k gold, launched in partnership with luxury jeweler Ring Concierge for Mother’s Day. Priced at $25—a nod to Kraft’s legacy of affordability—the necklace was positioned as the only "blue box" moms needed, turning a childhood staple into a lifestyle statement and elevating the emotional role of the brand in modern family life. Kaplan’s approach prioritizes high-impact storytelling and cultural specificity while reinforcing measurable outcomes. He advocates for marketing strategies that drive both long-term brand equity and near-term ROI—an increasingly essential balance in a tariff- and price-sensitive grocery landscape. Fabiola Torres With oversight of marketing, creative, visual merchandising and retail experience across Gap’s portfolio, Torres is leading the marketing charge to restore cultural heat and relevance to one of the category’s most iconic brands. Drawing on her marketing leadership experience at Nike, PepsiCo and Apple, Torres is reclaiming Gap’s creative legacy through campaigns like the recent “Feels Like Gap,” a nostalgia-tinged but still thoroughly modern anthem fronted by Parker Posey, reinforcing the brand’s celebration of individuality and ease. Torres has also doubled down on fashion and cultural relevance through buzzy collaborations with Malbon, Harlem’s Fashion Row and the return of Gap x Dôen, which helped introduce an expanded menswear and baby apparel assortment while showcasing gender-neutral silhouettes and vintage-inspired denim, all produced through Gap’s gender-equity-focused RISE program. As the eponymous cornerstone of the company’s portfolio (which also includes Banana Republic, Athleta and Old Navy), Gap is gaining cultural and commercial momentum: In Q1 2025, the company reported its 6th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Mike Katz Katz has oversight of how, where and when America’s second-largest wireless carrier by market share delivers products, experiences and messages across its digital, product, supply chain, and wholesale platforms. Reinforcing T-Mobile’s position in the telecommunications industry while also extending its influence beyond wireless and into adjacent sectors like retail media and advertising technology, Katz has leveraged the company’s scale to create a marketing engine that’s measurable, modern and built to compete well beyond telecom, merging brand, data and retail with precision. In the past year, he’s overseen the introduction of restructured wireless plan architectures, replacing legacy offerings with simplified tiers bundling premium streaming, high-speed hotspot data and satellite connectivity, anchored by a five-year price guarantee. This not only sharpened T-Mobile’s value proposition but also elevated wireless from a utility to a lifestyle offering, anchored in perks that drive customer retention and brand differentiation. Katz has also accelerated the company’s media ambitions through T-Mobile Advertising Solutions, building on its $1 billion-plus ad business with the acquisitions of Vistar Media and Blis. These strategic moves expanded T-Mobile’s digital out-of-home and omnichannel capabilities. A Google campaign utilizing T-Ads’s near-store activation strategy drove a 52% increase in Android device sales. In Q1 2025, T-Mobile reported a 7% revenue increase YoY. Ulrich-Klenke Klenke oversees global brand strategy, marketing communications and media, and is shaping one of the world’s most valuable telecommunications brands into a cultural force grounded in purpose, clarity and emotion. Under his marketing leadership and company influence, the German company has taken bold stances on social issues, most recently with the 2025 “Against Hate on the Net” campaign featuring Holocaust survivor Margot Friedländer, which reaffirmed the company’s human-centered approach to brand-building. He’s also sharpened Telekom’s presence at the intersection of media, sport, and technology: MagentaTV has secured exclusive rights to all matches in the 2026 Men’s and 2027 Women’s FIFA World Cups, backed by German household-name presenters Johannes B. Kerner and Wolff Fuss. Klenke has prioritized storytelling that resonates across Europe while maintaining a unified global identity, enabling the brand to stand for something greater than connectivity. Deutsche Telekom’s brand value surged 44% year-over-year in the 2025 Kantar BrandZ ranking, making it not only the most valuable German brand, but the top-ranked telco brand worldwide. Nicole Parlapiano Parlapiano’s influence has helped transform Tubi, part of FOX, into the most-watched free streaming service in the U.S. With creative courage and a viewer-first mindset, Parlapiano is creating new standards in the streaming space, redefining how and where a modern media brand engages its audiences. Over the past year, she’s amplified Tubi’s disruptive brand identity through risk-taking campaigns that treat marketing as entertainment, not interruption. She’s expanded Stubios—Tubi’s incubator for underrepresented creators—with new mentorship tracks and original short-form content, and led genre experimentation across the platform, tapping into niche communities through data-driven programming and culturally specific campaigns that speak directly to underserved audiences. In the past year, her team also activated high-impact tentpole moments around everything from horror drops to Black cinema, amplifying Tubi’s brand voice through partnerships, audience-resonant stunts, and social-first storytelling. Under her marketing leadership, Tubi’s monthly active users grew from 50 million (2022) to 100 million (as of June 2025), and the streamer now commands a greater percentage of total U.S. TV viewing time than Max, Peacock and Pluto TV. As the audience has grown, so have ad revenues, up 10% YoY for FY24. Jill Kramer With a remit spanning brand, advertising, content, media, sponsorships and performance marketing, Kramer leads a global team of more than 2,000 marketers for the world’s largest consulting firm by revenue and one of the largest and most influential operations in professional services. In an era defined by disruption, Kramer’s influence cuts across the firm and its clients. Over the past year, she has continued evolving the firm’s “Let There Be Change” platform and introducing AI-powered creative tools that deliver dynamic storytelling tailored to industries, clients and cultures worldwide. She’s also elevated Accenture’s cultural visibility with strategic media integrations and high-profile partnerships—like its World Economic Forum activations, featuring immersive demonstrations of responsible AI and sustainability at work. Announced last year as the official business and technology partner of the NFL, Kramer and Accenture highlighted the intersection of human potential and cutting-edge technology, helping reinforce the company’s position as a transformation partner to some of the world’s most ambitious organizations. For the quarter ending February 2025, the company reported YoY revenue increase of more than 5%. Sophia Colucci The architect of Molson Coors’s North American marketing transformation, Colucci leads brand strategy, creative, innovation, insights, digital and experiential across a portfolio that spans core beer giants like Coors Light and Miller Lite, heritage labels like Blue Moon and Coors Banquet, and a fast-expanding slate of spirits and non-alcoholic offerings. At the world’s fourth-largest brewer, Colucci has helped reposition the company as a more modern, culturally fluent beverage player, sharpening its creative edge and deepening its relevance across generations. In early 2025, Colucci transformed a deliberate misspelling in Coors Light's advertising—"Refershment" instead of "Refreshment"—into a multifaceted Super Bowl campaign. Embracing the concept of a "Case of the Mondays," the campaign featured limited-edition "Mondays Light" packaging, a Peloton partnership, and viral merchandise like the "Chill Face Roller," resonating with consumers experiencing post-Super Bowl sluggishness. The campaign culminated in a Super Bowl ad starring sloths navigating a slow Monday. Colucci also spearheaded a collaboration between Coors Banquet and Wrangler to produce "Beer Wash Jeans,” a limited-edition denim infused with Banquet beer that features co-branded details. This move reinforced Banquet’s Western heritage and contributed to its third consecutive year of growth. Looking ahead, she's orchestrating a U.S. relaunch of Peroni, including domestic production and a campaign tied to Formula 1 and its 0.0% alcohol offering. Under Colucci’s marketing leadership, Molson Coors continues sharpening its creative standards and pushing into new categories. in Q1 2025, the company reported sales had increased over 4% YoY. Will Brass Brass has helped the Premier League become a magnet for the world’s most iconic brands, deepening the cultural reach of the game well beyond the pitch. Overseeing all global commercial partnerships and media rights, he’s the architect behind the return of Coca-Cola as Official Soft Drink Partner starting in the 2025/26 season, a wide-ranging deal activating across Coke’s top brands and delivering exclusive fan experiences across the UK and Ireland. Just ahead of that, he helped secure the league’s first-ever global beer partnership with Guinness, a four-year agreement launching in the 2024/25 season and tapping into the brand’s storytelling prowess to amplify match-day rituals worldwide. With games now broadcast into 900 million homes across 189 countries, Brass’s commercial playbook continues to elevate the Premier League as both a sport and a global entertainment property. That strategy is paying off: League revenue rose 4.1% over the previous year, with commercial income rising 9% year-over-year thanks to expanded sponsorships and global activations. Bernd Körber At BMW, the world’s third most valuable car brand and a global benchmark for luxury automotive performance, Korber is redefining how brand and product come together to shape the future of driving. With oversight of global brand strategy, portfolio planning and experiential innovation, he’s integrated marketing and product development into a single strategic pipeline, ensuring every model, from concept to showroom, is built not just to perform, but to tell a compelling, values-driven story. This philosophy was on full display with the recent debut of the BMW Concept Speedtop at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, the shooting brake design blended performance engineering with elegant craftsmanship, including bespoke Schedoni luggage, while Koerber made headlines by confirming a limited production run of 70 units. At CES, Korber also unveiled the Vision Neue Klasse X and next-gen iDrive platform, showcasing how BMW is merging generative AI, adaptive UX, and immersive in-car entertainment to define mobility's emotional, digital future. Korber’s product-led brand strategy—where each launch functions as both a technological showcase and brand statement—has helped modernize BMW’s tone and broaden its appeal. The approach is delivering results: in Q1 2025, BMW posted record EV sales (up 27.9% YoY) and, as of June 6, the company’s stock was up nearly 10% YTD. Lisa McKnight McKnight is steering Mattel’s transformation from toymaker to IP-powered cultural force, redefining how legacy brands thrive. She has oversight of global brand strategy, creative, insights and licensing across the company’s entire portfolio, including for iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO and Masters of the Universe. Under McKnight’s leadership, Mattel has adopted a newly flattened, collaborative model that fuses marketing, media, and design from the earliest stages, resulting in integrated brand narratives that build brand equity by updating the cultural context in which the individual equities show up. From viral Ken doll moments—such as the LeBron James “Kenbassador” collaboration—and Barbie’s art-world crossovers, to Hot Wheels’ limited-edition drops with artists like Daniel Arsham and MSCHF, and UNO’s resurgence fueled by TikTok debates and creator house rules, McKnight’s fan-first, multi-platform strategy taps into nostalgia with fresh creative energy. The result is a slate of reimagined brands that feel both timely and resonant, telling new stories that connect across generations. Her push into experiential marketing, design-driven collectibles via Mattel Creations, and premium brand partnerships has unlocked new revenue streams and pop culture traction, especially among kidults, who are now the company’s fastest-growing audience. In a market where many brands are retreating, McKnight is advancing Mattel’s brand purpose by repositioning toys as art objects, cultural statements, and vehicles for self-expression. As of June 2, Mattel’s stock was up 4% YoY. Elizabeth Rutledge With oversight of the iconic financial services brand’s global brand strategy, media, sponsorships, and customer marketing, Rutledge’s influence has sharpened the company’s all-important brand and identity around service, trust and small business support. Under her marketing influence and leadership, American Express has been building on a legacy purpose-led strategy to drive deeper customer connection and brand differentiation, extended its longstanding support of small businesses with grants delivered through their “Backing Small” platform, helping thousands of independent businesses rebuild from natural disasters and grow for the future. Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With an unusually broad “super function” remit spanning marketing, product design, UX, go-to-market, creative, communications, research and insights, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion. Michelle Graham Clare With oversight of the iconic brand’s international marketing (i.e., outside the U.S.), Graham-Clare’s influence and remit extend across creative strategy, brand development and customer engagement for the world’s largest QSR company by market valuation. Over the past year, Graham-Clare has launched another chapter in the company’s fan-first strategy and platform, “Only at McDonald’s,” the global evolution of a U.K. campaign celebrating real customer rituals, and which has since inspired activations in Canada, Germany, and Australia. Under her marketing leadership, culturally attuned work like the U.K.’s “Gift of McDonald’s” holiday spot—directed by Gold Lion award-winner and Danish film-maker Nicolai Fuglsig—was named one of best campaigns of the year, showcasing how locally rooted storytelling can elevate brand meaning and emotional connection at scale. Beyond brand building, Graham-Clare is scaling loyalty and digital engagement through app-based experiences, limited-edition merch drops, and real-time activations meeting customers where they are. Graham-Clare is helping ensure that the iconic global brand stays emotionally relevant, digitally fluent, and locally loved. As of June 6, the company’s stock is up nearly 20% YoY. Charlie Smith Smith’s influence is redefining what luxury marketing looks and sounds like in the modern age—and how luxury brands behave across culture. In steering the LVMH-owned Spanish fashion house (and one of the world’s oldest luxury brands) into a new era, Smith is elevating Loewe’s profile and creating a new playbook for luxury storytelling, blending high-craft heritage with an internet-native wit not typical for luxury brands. Under his marketing leadership, Loewe has become one of fashion’s most digitally fluent and culturally resonant brands, known as much for its ironic tone and sharp social media presence as for its meticulous craftsmanship and bold creative direction. Smith oversees all aspects of Loewe’s brand and consumer communication, leading a global team across marketing, digital, PR, events and celebrity/influencer strategy. His remit spans traditional brand building and future-facing cultural invention — from the recent Crafted World exhibition in Tokyo (a multi-sensory showcase of Loewe’s craftsmanship that drew tens of thousands of reservations in days) to the brand’s viral TikTok strategy, which has attracted a new generation of fans. Loewe’s campaigns now regularly feature a mix of high-fashion polish and unexpected levity, including casting creators and memes alongside red-carpet celebrities, resulting in both virality and brand heat. The impact has been both reputational and financial: Loewe is one of the fastest-growing brands in the LVMH portfolio and, in the first quarter of 2025, sat atop the influential Lyst Index. Cristina Diezhandino With global oversight of marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the world’s fourth-largest alcohol and spirits company (based on market capitalization), Diezhandino’s influence is shaping the trajectory of over 200 brands sold in over 180 countries across the company’s portfolio. Over the past year, and as the category continues to shift and respond to forces ranging from changing consumption behaviors amongst younger generations to tariffs, Diezhandino has reorganized her global team into agile brand communities built for experimentation and speed. Over the past year, to accelerate brand and volume growth in the premium sector, Diezhandino has launched the Diageo Luxury Group to unify its high-end spirits portfolio and drive brand and strategic consistency globally. She has also introduced a virtual studio to better scale content and creative production, while also leading Diageo’s largest-ever consumer data initiative and establishing a global partnerships lab to unlock untapped growth through cultural collaborations. Guided by a mindset of possibility and a belief in progress over perfection, Diezhandino is reshaping how her teams understand and influence the future of socializing, long a category reference point, placing celebrations and cultural relevance at the center of every brand experience. Under her marketing leadership, inclusivity has become a hallmark of brand storytelling so to better reflect a more representative vision of modern drinkers. Nicole-Hubbard-Graham Since rejoining Nike in early 2024, Graham has led the brand’s marketing revival at a moment of existential reckoning. After years of revenue declines, stalled innovation, and an overcorrection toward direct-to-consumer sales and performance marketing, Nike is reorienting around brand storytelling, and Graham has been central to that pivot. She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years. The work marked a decisive shift back to the brand’s competitive DNA, earning widespread acclaim and restoring creative credibility. In May, Graham was promoted to EVP and CMO, expanding her remit to include oversight of storytelling across the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. She’s also deepening integration with product and design teams to reestablish cultural heat across categories. While Nike continues to face headwinds, recent campaigns have fueled renewed consumer engagement and helped slow its stock’s decline following years of erosion under previous leadership. In Q2 FY25, the company beat earnings expectations and maintained strong margins, signaling early momentum in its turnaround strategy. Manuel Arroyo Arroyo steers one of the world’s most iconic—and valuable—CPG brand portfolios at The Coca-Cola Company, the largest non-alcoholic beverage business globally, with more than 200 brands sold in over 200 countries. He oversees marketing for all five beverage categories, along with Human Insights, Integrated Marketing Experience (IMX), Marketing Operations & Capabilities, and Marketing Performance. Over the past year, Arroyo has accelerated Coca-Cola’s transformation into a data-powered, AI-enabled marketing engine designed for speed, scale and connection with modern consumers. Focused on driving increased brand strength and creative innovation, the company now delivers personalized, real-time content, powering global efforts like the 2025 return of “Share a Coke,” refreshed for Gen Z, and large-scale activations across Asia-Pacific for Lunar New Year. Campaigns like “Shades of Red” in Mexico—honoring Coca-Cola’s century-long partnership with local small businesses—and Powerade’s “Pause is Power” films, starring Spanish and Brazilian soccer stars Lamine Yamal and Rodrygo Goes, reflect Arroyo’s emphasis on human-centered storytelling that connects globally and hyper-locally. As of June 6, The Coca-Cola Company’s stock was up over 15% YTD. Mathilde DelHoume Delhoume-Debreu holds one of luxury's most culturally consequential marketing roles, stewarding marketing excellence for a portfolio of more than 75 maisons spanning fashion, jewelry, beauty, and spirits at the world’s most valuable luxury group. Her remit encompasses global brand image, content, media strategy and consumer insight, all funneled through a central “maison of expertise” that helps each LVMH brand—including globally resonant and iconic ones like Louis Vuitton, Moet, Hennessy, and Celine, and Sephora— translate heritage into contemporary and cultural resonance and relevance. Over the past year, Delhoume-Debreu played a pivotal role in activating the Group’s unexpected and pioneering Paris 2024 Olympics sponsorship, transforming the Olympics into a global luxury showcase and bringing its “Art of Crafting Dreams” ethos to life through headline-making moments like Dior-designed performance outfits, Louis Vuitton-crafted medal trays, and Moët Hennessy activations across hospitality spaces. Just as influential is her commitment to innovation and sustainability, and her leadership of the LVMH Innovation Award. She is also helping shape how LVMH’s maisons respond to macroeconomic turbulence, empowering each brand to lean into creating desirability and distinction and never discounting. Her work is less about uniformity and more about cultivating excellence through shared creative intelligence, enabling legacy brands like Dior and established acquisitions like Tiffany & Co. to evolve without losing their identity. Esi Eggleston Bracey Eggleston Bracey oversees marketing for a global portfolio of more than 400 brands—including icons like Dove, Hellmann’s, and Magnum—for the world’s fourth-largest fast-moving consumer goods company. With a remit spanning marketing, innovation and category growth, Eggleston Bracey’s influence is central to Unilever’s shift toward building brands that sit at the intersection of personal care, wellness and sustainability. Bracey’s helped accelerate Unilever’s adoption of AI-powered “digital twins”—virtual replicas of products used to simulate packaging, claims, and creative in-market before launch—cutting production costs by up to 55% and slashing campaign development timelines by 65%. This tech-forward pivot is freeing creative teams to focus on high-impact storytelling while ensuring consistency, speed and cost-efficiency at scale. Bracey also introduced and scaled Unilever’s new “Culture to Cart” strategy—an end-to-end approach that fuses brand storytelling with frictionless commerce. The model is designed to convert cultural moments directly into sales by linking campaigns to omnichannel buying paths. Recent executions include Dove’s Serum Shower launch, which paired wellness influencers with live-streamed tutorials and one-click product links; and Hellmann’s 2025 U.S. Super Bowl campaign, extending a broadcast ad to interactive recipe content, TikTok partnerships and integrations on Instacart, Walmart and Amazon.

Now totaling over 200 million members, Honors saw double-digit year-over-year growth in 2024. Hilton was just named one of Kantar’s 100 most valuable brands in the world, the only hotel brand to make the list—recognition driven by the consistent stay experience across its portfolio and Weinstein’s global storytelling.

With a focus on ensuring marketing and reputation align with and drive business growth, Virmani has helped solidify Infosys’s identity as an “AI-first, always ethical” partner. A new global brand platform, and the work of bringing it to life, emphasize the Indian multinational’s commitment to trustworthy, responsible innovation. This is an especially pointed stance as generative AI continues to shake industries, practices and, in some instances, confidence across sectors. Beyond positioning the enterprise for growth, Virmani is scaling the company’s presence in cultural arenas that intersect with its tech-forward ethos. He expanded Infosys’s high-profile sports-marketing footprint, deepening data-driven fan engagement strategies through partnerships with the ATP and the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 team, including metaverse activations and AI-powered analytics dashboards.

Since the debut of Copilot, a generative AI assistant that helps users write, summarize, analyze, code and create using large language models and Microsoft’s proprietary data, Numoto has led its rollout across core products like Word, Excel, Outlook and Windows, including the release to a billion Windows 10 users last fall. Numoto’s marketing emphasizes innovation and impact, spotlighted in campaigns like “Work Trend Index” and “Future of Work with AI” and real-world stories like the 500 public school teachers in Lima, Peru, who now use Copilot to design lesson plans and improve classroom engagement. At this year’s Microsoft Build, Numoto is also helping drive developer excitement around new tools like NLWeb and Windows AI Foundry, positioning Microsoft at the center of the agent-powered future of work. For the Quarter ending in March, Microsoft reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY, and the company’s stock was, as of June 6th, up over 12% YTD. Todd Kaplan Kaplan is leading the creative and commercial reboot of one of America’s most recognizable food companies—a $22 billion portfolio including iconic brands Heinz, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer and Philadelphia Cream Cheese. Since joining the company in mid-2024 from PepsiCo, Kaplan has driven a mix of cultural fluency and business discipline. Focused reestablishing the company’s brands as category leaders by modernizing its marketing engine and balancing emotional relevance with everyday utility, Kaplan oversees media and digital efforts, including the in-house content studio, "The Kitchen," and managing strategic innovation partnerships with NotCo and Just Spices. In the past year, he spearheaded one of Kraft Mac & Cheese’s most buzzworthy campaigns to date: a limited-edition “Forever Macaroni Necklace” made of 14k gold, launched in partnership with luxury jeweler Ring Concierge for Mother’s Day. Priced at $25—a nod to Kraft’s legacy of affordability—the necklace was positioned as the only "blue box" moms needed, turning a childhood staple into a lifestyle statement and elevating the emotional role of the brand in modern family life. Kaplan’s approach prioritizes high-impact storytelling and cultural specificity while reinforcing measurable outcomes. He advocates for marketing strategies that drive both long-term brand equity and near-term ROI—an increasingly essential balance in a tariff- and price-sensitive grocery landscape. Fabiola Torres With oversight of marketing, creative, visual merchandising and retail experience across Gap’s portfolio, Torres is leading the marketing charge to restore cultural heat and relevance to one of the category’s most iconic brands. Drawing on her marketing leadership experience at Nike, PepsiCo and Apple, Torres is reclaiming Gap’s creative legacy through campaigns like the recent “Feels Like Gap,” a nostalgia-tinged but still thoroughly modern anthem fronted by Parker Posey, reinforcing the brand’s celebration of individuality and ease. Torres has also doubled down on fashion and cultural relevance through buzzy collaborations with Malbon, Harlem’s Fashion Row and the return of Gap x Dôen, which helped introduce an expanded menswear and baby apparel assortment while showcasing gender-neutral silhouettes and vintage-inspired denim, all produced through Gap’s gender-equity-focused RISE program. As the eponymous cornerstone of the company’s portfolio (which also includes Banana Republic, Athleta and Old Navy), Gap is gaining cultural and commercial momentum: In Q1 2025, the company reported its 6th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Mike Katz Katz has oversight of how, where and when America’s second-largest wireless carrier by market share delivers products, experiences and messages across its digital, product, supply chain, and wholesale platforms. Reinforcing T-Mobile’s position in the telecommunications industry while also extending its influence beyond wireless and into adjacent sectors like retail media and advertising technology, Katz has leveraged the company’s scale to create a marketing engine that’s measurable, modern and built to compete well beyond telecom, merging brand, data and retail with precision. In the past year, he’s overseen the introduction of restructured wireless plan architectures, replacing legacy offerings with simplified tiers bundling premium streaming, high-speed hotspot data and satellite connectivity, anchored by a five-year price guarantee. This not only sharpened T-Mobile’s value proposition but also elevated wireless from a utility to a lifestyle offering, anchored in perks that drive customer retention and brand differentiation. Katz has also accelerated the company’s media ambitions through T-Mobile Advertising Solutions, building on its $1 billion-plus ad business with the acquisitions of Vistar Media and Blis. These strategic moves expanded T-Mobile’s digital out-of-home and omnichannel capabilities. A Google campaign utilizing T-Ads’s near-store activation strategy drove a 52% increase in Android device sales. In Q1 2025, T-Mobile reported a 7% revenue increase YoY. Ulrich-Klenke Klenke oversees global brand strategy, marketing communications and media, and is shaping one of the world’s most valuable telecommunications brands into a cultural force grounded in purpose, clarity and emotion. Under his marketing leadership and company influence, the German company has taken bold stances on social issues, most recently with the 2025 “Against Hate on the Net” campaign featuring Holocaust survivor Margot Friedländer, which reaffirmed the company’s human-centered approach to brand-building. He’s also sharpened Telekom’s presence at the intersection of media, sport, and technology: MagentaTV has secured exclusive rights to all matches in the 2026 Men’s and 2027 Women’s FIFA World Cups, backed by German household-name presenters Johannes B. Kerner and Wolff Fuss. Klenke has prioritized storytelling that resonates across Europe while maintaining a unified global identity, enabling the brand to stand for something greater than connectivity. Deutsche Telekom’s brand value surged 44% year-over-year in the 2025 Kantar BrandZ ranking, making it not only the most valuable German brand, but the top-ranked telco brand worldwide. Nicole Parlapiano Parlapiano’s influence has helped transform Tubi, part of FOX, into the most-watched free streaming service in the U.S. With creative courage and a viewer-first mindset, Parlapiano is creating new standards in the streaming space, redefining how and where a modern media brand engages its audiences. Over the past year, she’s amplified Tubi’s disruptive brand identity through risk-taking campaigns that treat marketing as entertainment, not interruption. She’s expanded Stubios—Tubi’s incubator for underrepresented creators—with new mentorship tracks and original short-form content, and led genre experimentation across the platform, tapping into niche communities through data-driven programming and culturally specific campaigns that speak directly to underserved audiences. In the past year, her team also activated high-impact tentpole moments around everything from horror drops to Black cinema, amplifying Tubi’s brand voice through partnerships, audience-resonant stunts, and social-first storytelling. Under her marketing leadership, Tubi’s monthly active users grew from 50 million (2022) to 100 million (as of June 2025), and the streamer now commands a greater percentage of total U.S. TV viewing time than Max, Peacock and Pluto TV. As the audience has grown, so have ad revenues, up 10% YoY for FY24. Jill Kramer With a remit spanning brand, advertising, content, media, sponsorships and performance marketing, Kramer leads a global team of more than 2,000 marketers for the world’s largest consulting firm by revenue and one of the largest and most influential operations in professional services. In an era defined by disruption, Kramer’s influence cuts across the firm and its clients. Over the past year, she has continued evolving the firm’s “Let There Be Change” platform and introducing AI-powered creative tools that deliver dynamic storytelling tailored to industries, clients and cultures worldwide. She’s also elevated Accenture’s cultural visibility with strategic media integrations and high-profile partnerships—like its World Economic Forum activations, featuring immersive demonstrations of responsible AI and sustainability at work. Announced last year as the official business and technology partner of the NFL, Kramer and Accenture highlighted the intersection of human potential and cutting-edge technology, helping reinforce the company’s position as a transformation partner to some of the world’s most ambitious organizations. For the quarter ending February 2025, the company reported YoY revenue increase of more than 5%. Sophia Colucci The architect of Molson Coors’s North American marketing transformation, Colucci leads brand strategy, creative, innovation, insights, digital and experiential across a portfolio that spans core beer giants like Coors Light and Miller Lite, heritage labels like Blue Moon and Coors Banquet, and a fast-expanding slate of spirits and non-alcoholic offerings. At the world’s fourth-largest brewer, Colucci has helped reposition the company as a more modern, culturally fluent beverage player, sharpening its creative edge and deepening its relevance across generations. In early 2025, Colucci transformed a deliberate misspelling in Coors Light's advertising—"Refershment" instead of "Refreshment"—into a multifaceted Super Bowl campaign. Embracing the concept of a "Case of the Mondays," the campaign featured limited-edition "Mondays Light" packaging, a Peloton partnership, and viral merchandise like the "Chill Face Roller," resonating with consumers experiencing post-Super Bowl sluggishness. The campaign culminated in a Super Bowl ad starring sloths navigating a slow Monday. Colucci also spearheaded a collaboration between Coors Banquet and Wrangler to produce "Beer Wash Jeans,” a limited-edition denim infused with Banquet beer that features co-branded details. This move reinforced Banquet’s Western heritage and contributed to its third consecutive year of growth. Looking ahead, she's orchestrating a U.S. relaunch of Peroni, including domestic production and a campaign tied to Formula 1 and its 0.0% alcohol offering. Under Colucci’s marketing leadership, Molson Coors continues sharpening its creative standards and pushing into new categories. in Q1 2025, the company reported sales had increased over 4% YoY. Will Brass Brass has helped the Premier League become a magnet for the world’s most iconic brands, deepening the cultural reach of the game well beyond the pitch. Overseeing all global commercial partnerships and media rights, he’s the architect behind the return of Coca-Cola as Official Soft Drink Partner starting in the 2025/26 season, a wide-ranging deal activating across Coke’s top brands and delivering exclusive fan experiences across the UK and Ireland. Just ahead of that, he helped secure the league’s first-ever global beer partnership with Guinness, a four-year agreement launching in the 2024/25 season and tapping into the brand’s storytelling prowess to amplify match-day rituals worldwide. With games now broadcast into 900 million homes across 189 countries, Brass’s commercial playbook continues to elevate the Premier League as both a sport and a global entertainment property. That strategy is paying off: League revenue rose 4.1% over the previous year, with commercial income rising 9% year-over-year thanks to expanded sponsorships and global activations. Bernd Körber At BMW, the world’s third most valuable car brand and a global benchmark for luxury automotive performance, Korber is redefining how brand and product come together to shape the future of driving. With oversight of global brand strategy, portfolio planning and experiential innovation, he’s integrated marketing and product development into a single strategic pipeline, ensuring every model, from concept to showroom, is built not just to perform, but to tell a compelling, values-driven story. This philosophy was on full display with the recent debut of the BMW Concept Speedtop at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, the shooting brake design blended performance engineering with elegant craftsmanship, including bespoke Schedoni luggage, while Koerber made headlines by confirming a limited production run of 70 units. At CES, Korber also unveiled the Vision Neue Klasse X and next-gen iDrive platform, showcasing how BMW is merging generative AI, adaptive UX, and immersive in-car entertainment to define mobility's emotional, digital future. Korber’s product-led brand strategy—where each launch functions as both a technological showcase and brand statement—has helped modernize BMW’s tone and broaden its appeal. The approach is delivering results: in Q1 2025, BMW posted record EV sales (up 27.9% YoY) and, as of June 6, the company’s stock was up nearly 10% YTD. Lisa McKnight McKnight is steering Mattel’s transformation from toymaker to IP-powered cultural force, redefining how legacy brands thrive. She has oversight of global brand strategy, creative, insights and licensing across the company’s entire portfolio, including for iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO and Masters of the Universe. Under McKnight’s leadership, Mattel has adopted a newly flattened, collaborative model that fuses marketing, media, and design from the earliest stages, resulting in integrated brand narratives that build brand equity by updating the cultural context in which the individual equities show up. From viral Ken doll moments—such as the LeBron James “Kenbassador” collaboration—and Barbie’s art-world crossovers, to Hot Wheels’ limited-edition drops with artists like Daniel Arsham and MSCHF, and UNO’s resurgence fueled by TikTok debates and creator house rules, McKnight’s fan-first, multi-platform strategy taps into nostalgia with fresh creative energy. The result is a slate of reimagined brands that feel both timely and resonant, telling new stories that connect across generations. Her push into experiential marketing, design-driven collectibles via Mattel Creations, and premium brand partnerships has unlocked new revenue streams and pop culture traction, especially among kidults, who are now the company’s fastest-growing audience. In a market where many brands are retreating, McKnight is advancing Mattel’s brand purpose by repositioning toys as art objects, cultural statements, and vehicles for self-expression. As of June 2, Mattel’s stock was up 4% YoY. Elizabeth Rutledge With oversight of the iconic financial services brand’s global brand strategy, media, sponsorships, and customer marketing, Rutledge’s influence has sharpened the company’s all-important brand and identity around service, trust and small business support. Under her marketing influence and leadership, American Express has been building on a legacy purpose-led strategy to drive deeper customer connection and brand differentiation, extended its longstanding support of small businesses with grants delivered through their “Backing Small” platform, helping thousands of independent businesses rebuild from natural disasters and grow for the future. Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With an unusually broad “super function” remit spanning marketing, product design, UX, go-to-market, creative, communications, research and insights, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion. Michelle Graham Clare With oversight of the iconic brand’s international marketing (i.e., outside the U.S.), Graham-Clare’s influence and remit extend across creative strategy, brand development and customer engagement for the world’s largest QSR company by market valuation. Over the past year, Graham-Clare has launched another chapter in the company’s fan-first strategy and platform, “Only at McDonald’s,” the global evolution of a U.K. campaign celebrating real customer rituals, and which has since inspired activations in Canada, Germany, and Australia. Under her marketing leadership, culturally attuned work like the U.K.’s “Gift of McDonald’s” holiday spot—directed by Gold Lion award-winner and Danish film-maker Nicolai Fuglsig—was named one of best campaigns of the year, showcasing how locally rooted storytelling can elevate brand meaning and emotional connection at scale. Beyond brand building, Graham-Clare is scaling loyalty and digital engagement through app-based experiences, limited-edition merch drops, and real-time activations meeting customers where they are. Graham-Clare is helping ensure that the iconic global brand stays emotionally relevant, digitally fluent, and locally loved. As of June 6, the company’s stock is up nearly 20% YoY. Charlie Smith Smith’s influence is redefining what luxury marketing looks and sounds like in the modern age—and how luxury brands behave across culture. In steering the LVMH-owned Spanish fashion house (and one of the world’s oldest luxury brands) into a new era, Smith is elevating Loewe’s profile and creating a new playbook for luxury storytelling, blending high-craft heritage with an internet-native wit not typical for luxury brands. Under his marketing leadership, Loewe has become one of fashion’s most digitally fluent and culturally resonant brands, known as much for its ironic tone and sharp social media presence as for its meticulous craftsmanship and bold creative direction. Smith oversees all aspects of Loewe’s brand and consumer communication, leading a global team across marketing, digital, PR, events and celebrity/influencer strategy. His remit spans traditional brand building and future-facing cultural invention — from the recent Crafted World exhibition in Tokyo (a multi-sensory showcase of Loewe’s craftsmanship that drew tens of thousands of reservations in days) to the brand’s viral TikTok strategy, which has attracted a new generation of fans. Loewe’s campaigns now regularly feature a mix of high-fashion polish and unexpected levity, including casting creators and memes alongside red-carpet celebrities, resulting in both virality and brand heat. The impact has been both reputational and financial: Loewe is one of the fastest-growing brands in the LVMH portfolio and, in the first quarter of 2025, sat atop the influential Lyst Index. Cristina Diezhandino With global oversight of marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the world’s fourth-largest alcohol and spirits company (based on market capitalization), Diezhandino’s influence is shaping the trajectory of over 200 brands sold in over 180 countries across the company’s portfolio. Over the past year, and as the category continues to shift and respond to forces ranging from changing consumption behaviors amongst younger generations to tariffs, Diezhandino has reorganized her global team into agile brand communities built for experimentation and speed. Over the past year, to accelerate brand and volume growth in the premium sector, Diezhandino has launched the Diageo Luxury Group to unify its high-end spirits portfolio and drive brand and strategic consistency globally. She has also introduced a virtual studio to better scale content and creative production, while also leading Diageo’s largest-ever consumer data initiative and establishing a global partnerships lab to unlock untapped growth through cultural collaborations. Guided by a mindset of possibility and a belief in progress over perfection, Diezhandino is reshaping how her teams understand and influence the future of socializing, long a category reference point, placing celebrations and cultural relevance at the center of every brand experience. Under her marketing leadership, inclusivity has become a hallmark of brand storytelling so to better reflect a more representative vision of modern drinkers. Nicole-Hubbard-Graham Since rejoining Nike in early 2024, Graham has led the brand’s marketing revival at a moment of existential reckoning. After years of revenue declines, stalled innovation, and an overcorrection toward direct-to-consumer sales and performance marketing, Nike is reorienting around brand storytelling, and Graham has been central to that pivot. She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years. The work marked a decisive shift back to the brand’s competitive DNA, earning widespread acclaim and restoring creative credibility. In May, Graham was promoted to EVP and CMO, expanding her remit to include oversight of storytelling across the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. She’s also deepening integration with product and design teams to reestablish cultural heat across categories. While Nike continues to face headwinds, recent campaigns have fueled renewed consumer engagement and helped slow its stock’s decline following years of erosion under previous leadership. In Q2 FY25, the company beat earnings expectations and maintained strong margins, signaling early momentum in its turnaround strategy. Manuel Arroyo Arroyo steers one of the world’s most iconic—and valuable—CPG brand portfolios at The Coca-Cola Company, the largest non-alcoholic beverage business globally, with more than 200 brands sold in over 200 countries. He oversees marketing for all five beverage categories, along with Human Insights, Integrated Marketing Experience (IMX), Marketing Operations & Capabilities, and Marketing Performance. Over the past year, Arroyo has accelerated Coca-Cola’s transformation into a data-powered, AI-enabled marketing engine designed for speed, scale and connection with modern consumers. Focused on driving increased brand strength and creative innovation, the company now delivers personalized, real-time content, powering global efforts like the 2025 return of “Share a Coke,” refreshed for Gen Z, and large-scale activations across Asia-Pacific for Lunar New Year. Campaigns like “Shades of Red” in Mexico—honoring Coca-Cola’s century-long partnership with local small businesses—and Powerade’s “Pause is Power” films, starring Spanish and Brazilian soccer stars Lamine Yamal and Rodrygo Goes, reflect Arroyo’s emphasis on human-centered storytelling that connects globally and hyper-locally. As of June 6, The Coca-Cola Company’s stock was up over 15% YTD. Mathilde DelHoume Delhoume-Debreu holds one of luxury's most culturally consequential marketing roles, stewarding marketing excellence for a portfolio of more than 75 maisons spanning fashion, jewelry, beauty, and spirits at the world’s most valuable luxury group. Her remit encompasses global brand image, content, media strategy and consumer insight, all funneled through a central “maison of expertise” that helps each LVMH brand—including globally resonant and iconic ones like Louis Vuitton, Moet, Hennessy, and Celine, and Sephora— translate heritage into contemporary and cultural resonance and relevance. Over the past year, Delhoume-Debreu played a pivotal role in activating the Group’s unexpected and pioneering Paris 2024 Olympics sponsorship, transforming the Olympics into a global luxury showcase and bringing its “Art of Crafting Dreams” ethos to life through headline-making moments like Dior-designed performance outfits, Louis Vuitton-crafted medal trays, and Moët Hennessy activations across hospitality spaces. Just as influential is her commitment to innovation and sustainability, and her leadership of the LVMH Innovation Award. She is also helping shape how LVMH’s maisons respond to macroeconomic turbulence, empowering each brand to lean into creating desirability and distinction and never discounting. Her work is less about uniformity and more about cultivating excellence through shared creative intelligence, enabling legacy brands like Dior and established acquisitions like Tiffany & Co. to evolve without losing their identity. Esi Eggleston Bracey Eggleston Bracey oversees marketing for a global portfolio of more than 400 brands—including icons like Dove, Hellmann’s, and Magnum—for the world’s fourth-largest fast-moving consumer goods company. With a remit spanning marketing, innovation and category growth, Eggleston Bracey’s influence is central to Unilever’s shift toward building brands that sit at the intersection of personal care, wellness and sustainability. Bracey’s helped accelerate Unilever’s adoption of AI-powered “digital twins”—virtual replicas of products used to simulate packaging, claims, and creative in-market before launch—cutting production costs by up to 55% and slashing campaign development timelines by 65%. This tech-forward pivot is freeing creative teams to focus on high-impact storytelling while ensuring consistency, speed and cost-efficiency at scale. Bracey also introduced and scaled Unilever’s new “Culture to Cart” strategy—an end-to-end approach that fuses brand storytelling with frictionless commerce. The model is designed to convert cultural moments directly into sales by linking campaigns to omnichannel buying paths. Recent executions include Dove’s Serum Shower launch, which paired wellness influencers with live-streamed tutorials and one-click product links; and Hellmann’s 2025 U.S. Super Bowl campaign, extending a broadcast ad to interactive recipe content, TikTok partnerships and integrations on Instacart, Walmart and Amazon. By collapsing the gap between culture and conversion, Bracey is reshaping how Unilever brands show up in the world—and in the shopping cart. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 13% YoY. Mark Weinstein A driving force at the helm of Hilton’s global marketing, brand, partnerships, digital innovation and loyalty strategy, Weinstein’s influence is shaping the future of hospitality for the world’s second-largest hotel company by market capitalization. With 24 distinct brands in its hotel management portfolio—including Hilton, Waldorf Astoria, Conrad, and Motto—and with more than 8,600 properties operating across 139 countries and territories, Hilton plays a central role in the travel experience for millions of consumers. Weinstein has continued building equity in Hilton’s “For the Stay” platform, evolving it through culturally resonant campaigns, including a wellness-focused integration with Calm and a new partnership with The Football Association that positioned Hilton as the official partner of Wembley Stadium and the England national teams. Weinstein has also expanded Hilton Honors into a cross-market growth engine, launching a first-of-its-kind integration with China’s DiDi Mileage to offer reciprocal status benefits and seamless travel experiences across platforms. Now totaling over 200 million members, Honors saw double-digit year-over-year growth in 2024. Hilton was just named one of Kantar’s 100 most valuable brands in the world, the only hotel brand to make the list—recognition driven by the consistent stay experience across its portfolio and Weinstein’s global storytelling. Hilton closed 2024 with record system-wide revenues, up 12% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 25% YoY. Sumit Virmani Virmani’s influence extends across oversight of brand, communications, digital experience and strategic partnerships in 56 countries for the IT behemoth, recently ranked one of the world’s most valuable IT service brands globally. With a focus on ensuring marketing and reputation align with and drive business growth, Virmani has helped solidify Infosys’s identity as an “AI-first, always ethical” partner. A new global brand platform, and the work of bringing it to life, emphasize the Indian multinational’s commitment to trustworthy, responsible innovation. This is an especially pointed stance as generative AI continues to shake industries, practices and, in some instances, confidence across sectors. Beyond positioning the enterprise for growth, Virmani is scaling the company’s presence in cultural arenas that intersect with its tech-forward ethos. He expanded Infosys’s high-profile sports-marketing footprint, deepening data-driven fan engagement strategies through partnerships with the ATP and the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 team, including metaverse activations and AI-powered analytics dashboards. In the past year, he’s also elevated the Infosys Springboard learning platform, embedding it into the brand’s narrative as a global commitment to digital upskilling, with measurable impact across India, Africa, and the U.S. This multi-pronged strategy has helped Infosys maintain relevance and trust in a volatile tech landscape.

As the brand evolves from hotelier to holistic luxury ecosystem, Speichert is helping shape that future, not just marketing new offerings but driving the commercial strategy behind them. This includes improving the performance of the brand’s 128 hotels and resorts. In the past year, Speichert and his team overhauled commercial operations to better support hotel growth, introducing a “mirror organization” model that embedded subject-matter experts regionally and empowered local teams to act with agility. At the same time, Speichert is expanding Four Seasons into new territory. in 2025, their Private Jet Experience is pacing ahead of 2024 bookings, buoyed by high repeat rates and 100% guest satisfaction. Speichert is also leading the launch of Four Seasons's first luxury yachts, redefining ultra-luxury cruising with residential-style suites. Culturally, what began as a COVID-era location deal with White Lotus has grown into a three-year, business-driving platform, with triple-digit spikes in web traffic, increased occupancy in suites featured on-screen, and high-profile activations. This past season was also the first where Four Seasons secured the rights to use the fictional brand name for its own marketing. With a robust development pipeline, Four Seasons plans to solidify its position as the world's largest operator of luxury properties under a single brand. In the past year, the privately held company reported record financial performance, with continued gains in occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), and brand preference—especially among top-tier travelers. Vineet Mehra At Chime, one of America’s fastest-growing fintechs, Mehra is leading a marketing transformation in a category long constrained by regulation and sameness. The veteran of Walgreens, Johnson & Johnson and Ancestry, Mehra has rebuilt Chime’s marketing organization into a performance storytelling engine—dismantling silos between brand and growth, embedding data science and AI fluency across teams, and designing cross-functional squads that align marketing, product and finance against shared business outcomes. At the heart of his strategy is an unapologetically commercial view of brand: one that treats marketing as capital allocation and measures ROI with the same rigor as R&D. Under his influence, The privately held company has ramped up creative output in the past year, launching a stream of social-first campaigns tailored to Chime’s digitally native, youth-skewing audience. That strategy has made Chime not only Instagram’s most-followed U.S. banking brand but also one of the best-loved across categories, with a referral rate 5x the national average and 1.5x higher than fintech peers. As Chime files an IPO estimated to be worth more than $20 billion, the company reported a 38% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by strong customer acquisition, high engagement, and sustained LTV-to-CAC efficiency. Ariel Kelman Kelman is shaping the next era of intelligent, trust-first marketing at Salesforce, the world’s #1 AI CRM platform and one of the most valuable enterprise software companies globally.

With a focus on driving growth by elevating Qualcomm from a behind-the-scenes chipmaker to a visible force shaping the future of tech broadly and on-device AI specifically, McGuire’s influence extends to reimagining how the company’s B2B and B2C brands drive resonance, relevance and growth. Over the past year, these efforts are seen in his marketing of the consumer-facing Snapdragon brand, Qualcomm’s premium system-on-chip used in flagship smartphones, next-gen PCs, XR headsets and, increasingly, connected vehicles. While Snapdragon is technically a product line, McGuire has positioned it as an aspirational platform for AI innovation, debuting features like offline voice translation and generative image tools. His marketing has brought these capabilities to life through strategic integrations with Microsoft and Meta and expressive brand work, including a new sonic identity and CES activations with BMW and Louis Vuitton.

Eduardo Parra/Europa Press/Getty Images The largest bank in continental Europe and the 18th largest globally as measured by market capitalization, and under Cendoya’s leadership, the Spanish financial services brand has evolved from that of a regionally recognized retail bank to a unified, innovation-forward global financial institution.

Over the past year, he consolidated the bank’s media and creative operations under a single holding company to streamline messaging and accelerate transformation. He also spearheaded a global partnership with Formula 1’s Williams Racing, a strategic move to raise visibility among younger, digitally native audiences, especially in the U.S. market.

In January 2025, she led the launch of the AT&T Guarantee, a bold shift toward radical transparency and accountability, and the first program in the telecom category to proactively offer bill credits for service disruptions across both wireless and fiber. By reinforcing reliability as a core brand promise rather than a reactive customer service measure, the AT&T Guarantee is a strategic shift in a sector long plagued by fine print, opaque pricing and churn driven by dissatisfaction. Backed by omnichannel marketing and frontline integration, the platform is designed to create differentiation in a category that has historically competed on the same terms, while building trust at scale. Smith Kenny’s influence has also advanced purpose-driven work for the iconic brand, through projects like “Route to Connection,” a short documentary on the digital divide in Amarillo, Texas, and Shine Away, a multiplatform collaboration with Hello Sunshine spotlighting women in technology. as of June 6, AT&T’s stock was up more than 55% YoY.

In order to energize younger and more diverse audiences, Through cross-platform campaigns, including the recent “More Than Game” and “Viewer Discretion” initiatives, Cook has exerted significant influence, not just on the WNBA but far beyond: As the architect of the league’s broader visibility surge, he’s become a central player in the rise of women’s sports fandom by converting cultural relevance into commercial growth across the sports ecosystem. In the past year, the league secured a landmark $2.2B media rights deal—its most lucrative to date—and league revenues reached a record high. Lorenzo Bertelli At Prada, one of the most influential fashion houses in the world and a cornerstone of Italian luxury, Bertelli oversees global brand strategy, media, digital and sustainability initiatives, positioning Prada at the vanguard of creative innovation and ethical leadership. Bertelli is reimagining what a legacy brand can look like in the age of conscious consumerism and digital acceleration, leading the brand’s continued push into immersive digital storytelling—amplified through Prada’s dynamic Milan runway shows and content-rich campaigns—and reinforcing its appeal to the Gen Zers and millennials central to its future growth. At the same time, Bertelli advanced Prada’s ESG commitments, including expanded traceability in its Re-Nylon collection and the launch of the Group’s DE&I advisory council. Under his stewardship, Prada has deepened its already rich cultural cachet through high-profile collaborations, such as its ongoing partnership with the America’s Cup and an acclaimed art film initiative during the Venice Biennale. Despite difficult times for many in the luxury business, in Q1 25, the Group reported a 16% YoY revenue increase, with Asia and the Americas driving growth. Microsoft Numoto leads end-to-end marketing for Microsoft’s $270 billion business, overseeing global brand, product marketing, commercial go-to-market and customer engagement across a portfolio that includes Azure, Windows, Surface, Microsoft 365, and Copilot. His scope spans enterprise, developer and consumer audiences, unifying messaging across sectors and scaling the adoption of Microsoft technologies worldwide. Since the debut of Copilot, a generative AI assistant that helps users write, summarize, analyze, code and create using large language models and Microsoft’s proprietary data, Numoto has led its rollout across core products like Word, Excel, Outlook and Windows, including the release to a billion Windows 10 users last fall. Numoto’s marketing emphasizes innovation and impact, spotlighted in campaigns like “Work Trend Index” and “Future of Work with AI” and real-world stories like the 500 public school teachers in Lima, Peru, who now use Copilot to design lesson plans and improve classroom engagement. At this year’s Microsoft Build, Numoto is also helping drive developer excitement around new tools like NLWeb and Windows AI Foundry, positioning Microsoft at the center of the agent-powered future of work. For the Quarter ending in March, Microsoft reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY, and the company’s stock was, as of June 6th, up over 12% YTD. Todd Kaplan Kaplan is leading the creative and commercial reboot of one of America’s most recognizable food companies—a $22 billion portfolio including iconic brands Heinz, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer and Philadelphia Cream Cheese. Since joining the company in mid-2024 from PepsiCo, Kaplan has driven a mix of cultural fluency and business discipline. Focused reestablishing the company’s brands as category leaders by modernizing its marketing engine and balancing emotional relevance with everyday utility, Kaplan oversees media and digital efforts, including the in-house content studio, "The Kitchen," and managing strategic innovation partnerships with NotCo and Just Spices. In the past year, he spearheaded one of Kraft Mac & Cheese’s most buzzworthy campaigns to date: a limited-edition “Forever Macaroni Necklace” made of 14k gold, launched in partnership with luxury jeweler Ring Concierge for Mother’s Day. Priced at $25—a nod to Kraft’s legacy of affordability—the necklace was positioned as the only "blue box" moms needed, turning a childhood staple into a lifestyle statement and elevating the emotional role of the brand in modern family life. Kaplan’s approach prioritizes high-impact storytelling and cultural specificity while reinforcing measurable outcomes. He advocates for marketing strategies that drive both long-term brand equity and near-term ROI—an increasingly essential balance in a tariff- and price-sensitive grocery landscape. Fabiola Torres With oversight of marketing, creative, visual merchandising and retail experience across Gap’s portfolio, Torres is leading the marketing charge to restore cultural heat and relevance to one of the category’s most iconic brands. Drawing on her marketing leadership experience at Nike, PepsiCo and Apple, Torres is reclaiming Gap’s creative legacy through campaigns like the recent “Feels Like Gap,” a nostalgia-tinged but still thoroughly modern anthem fronted by Parker Posey, reinforcing the brand’s celebration of individuality and ease. Torres has also doubled down on fashion and cultural relevance through buzzy collaborations with Malbon, Harlem’s Fashion Row and the return of Gap x Dôen, which helped introduce an expanded menswear and baby apparel assortment while showcasing gender-neutral silhouettes and vintage-inspired denim, all produced through Gap’s gender-equity-focused RISE program. As the eponymous cornerstone of the company’s portfolio (which also includes Banana Republic, Athleta and Old Navy), Gap is gaining cultural and commercial momentum: In Q1 2025, the company reported its 6th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Mike Katz Katz has oversight of how, where and when America’s second-largest wireless carrier by market share delivers products, experiences and messages across its digital, product, supply chain, and wholesale platforms. Reinforcing T-Mobile’s position in the telecommunications industry while also extending its influence beyond wireless and into adjacent sectors like retail media and advertising technology, Katz has leveraged the company’s scale to create a marketing engine that’s measurable, modern and built to compete well beyond telecom, merging brand, data and retail with precision. In the past year, he’s overseen the introduction of restructured wireless plan architectures, replacing legacy offerings with simplified tiers bundling premium streaming, high-speed hotspot data and satellite connectivity, anchored by a five-year price guarantee. This not only sharpened T-Mobile’s value proposition but also elevated wireless from a utility to a lifestyle offering, anchored in perks that drive customer retention and brand differentiation. Katz has also accelerated the company’s media ambitions through T-Mobile Advertising Solutions, building on its $1 billion-plus ad business with the acquisitions of Vistar Media and Blis. These strategic moves expanded T-Mobile’s digital out-of-home and omnichannel capabilities. A Google campaign utilizing T-Ads’s near-store activation strategy drove a 52% increase in Android device sales. In Q1 2025, T-Mobile reported a 7% revenue increase YoY. Ulrich-Klenke Klenke oversees global brand strategy, marketing communications and media, and is shaping one of the world’s most valuable telecommunications brands into a cultural force grounded in purpose, clarity and emotion. Under his marketing leadership and company influence, the German company has taken bold stances on social issues, most recently with the 2025 “Against Hate on the Net” campaign featuring Holocaust survivor Margot Friedländer, which reaffirmed the company’s human-centered approach to brand-building. He’s also sharpened Telekom’s presence at the intersection of media, sport, and technology: MagentaTV has secured exclusive rights to all matches in the 2026 Men’s and 2027 Women’s FIFA World Cups, backed by German household-name presenters Johannes B. Kerner and Wolff Fuss. Klenke has prioritized storytelling that resonates across Europe while maintaining a unified global identity, enabling the brand to stand for something greater than connectivity. Deutsche Telekom’s brand value surged 44% year-over-year in the 2025 Kantar BrandZ ranking, making it not only the most valuable German brand, but the top-ranked telco brand worldwide. Nicole Parlapiano Parlapiano’s influence has helped transform Tubi, part of FOX, into the most-watched free streaming service in the U.S. With creative courage and a viewer-first mindset, Parlapiano is creating new standards in the streaming space, redefining how and where a modern media brand engages its audiences. Over the past year, she’s amplified Tubi’s disruptive brand identity through risk-taking campaigns that treat marketing as entertainment, not interruption. She’s expanded Stubios—Tubi’s incubator for underrepresented creators—with new mentorship tracks and original short-form content, and led genre experimentation across the platform, tapping into niche communities through data-driven programming and culturally specific campaigns that speak directly to underserved audiences. In the past year, her team also activated high-impact tentpole moments around everything from horror drops to Black cinema, amplifying Tubi’s brand voice through partnerships, audience-resonant stunts, and social-first storytelling. Under her marketing leadership, Tubi’s monthly active users grew from 50 million (2022) to 100 million (as of June 2025), and the streamer now commands a greater percentage of total U.S. TV viewing time than Max, Peacock and Pluto TV. As the audience has grown, so have ad revenues, up 10% YoY for FY24. Jill Kramer With a remit spanning brand, advertising, content, media, sponsorships and performance marketing, Kramer leads a global team of more than 2,000 marketers for the world’s largest consulting firm by revenue and one of the largest and most influential operations in professional services. In an era defined by disruption, Kramer’s influence cuts across the firm and its clients. Over the past year, she has continued evolving the firm’s “Let There Be Change” platform and introducing AI-powered creative tools that deliver dynamic storytelling tailored to industries, clients and cultures worldwide. She’s also elevated Accenture’s cultural visibility with strategic media integrations and high-profile partnerships—like its World Economic Forum activations, featuring immersive demonstrations of responsible AI and sustainability at work. Announced last year as the official business and technology partner of the NFL, Kramer and Accenture highlighted the intersection of human potential and cutting-edge technology, helping reinforce the company’s position as a transformation partner to some of the world’s most ambitious organizations. For the quarter ending February 2025, the company reported YoY revenue increase of more than 5%. Sophia Colucci The architect of Molson Coors’s North American marketing transformation, Colucci leads brand strategy, creative, innovation, insights, digital and experiential across a portfolio that spans core beer giants like Coors Light and Miller Lite, heritage labels like Blue Moon and Coors Banquet, and a fast-expanding slate of spirits and non-alcoholic offerings. At the world’s fourth-largest brewer, Colucci has helped reposition the company as a more modern, culturally fluent beverage player, sharpening its creative edge and deepening its relevance across generations. In early 2025, Colucci transformed a deliberate misspelling in Coors Light's advertising—"Refershment" instead of "Refreshment"—into a multifaceted Super Bowl campaign. Embracing the concept of a "Case of the Mondays," the campaign featured limited-edition "Mondays Light" packaging, a Peloton partnership, and viral merchandise like the "Chill Face Roller," resonating with consumers experiencing post-Super Bowl sluggishness. The campaign culminated in a Super Bowl ad starring sloths navigating a slow Monday. Colucci also spearheaded a collaboration between Coors Banquet and Wrangler to produce "Beer Wash Jeans,” a limited-edition denim infused with Banquet beer that features co-branded details. This move reinforced Banquet’s Western heritage and contributed to its third consecutive year of growth. Looking ahead, she's orchestrating a U.S. relaunch of Peroni, including domestic production and a campaign tied to Formula 1 and its 0.0% alcohol offering. Under Colucci’s marketing leadership, Molson Coors continues sharpening its creative standards and pushing into new categories. in Q1 2025, the company reported sales had increased over 4% YoY. Will Brass Brass has helped the Premier League become a magnet for the world’s most iconic brands, deepening the cultural reach of the game well beyond the pitch. Overseeing all global commercial partnerships and media rights, he’s the architect behind the return of Coca-Cola as Official Soft Drink Partner starting in the 2025/26 season, a wide-ranging deal activating across Coke’s top brands and delivering exclusive fan experiences across the UK and Ireland. Just ahead of that, he helped secure the league’s first-ever global beer partnership with Guinness, a four-year agreement launching in the 2024/25 season and tapping into the brand’s storytelling prowess to amplify match-day rituals worldwide. With games now broadcast into 900 million homes across 189 countries, Brass’s commercial playbook continues to elevate the Premier League as both a sport and a global entertainment property. That strategy is paying off: League revenue rose 4.1% over the previous year, with commercial income rising 9% year-over-year thanks to expanded sponsorships and global activations. Bernd Körber At BMW, the world’s third most valuable car brand and a global benchmark for luxury automotive performance, Korber is redefining how brand and product come together to shape the future of driving. With oversight of global brand strategy, portfolio planning and experiential innovation, he’s integrated marketing and product development into a single strategic pipeline, ensuring every model, from concept to showroom, is built not just to perform, but to tell a compelling, values-driven story. This philosophy was on full display with the recent debut of the BMW Concept Speedtop at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, the shooting brake design blended performance engineering with elegant craftsmanship, including bespoke Schedoni luggage, while Koerber made headlines by confirming a limited production run of 70 units. At CES, Korber also unveiled the Vision Neue Klasse X and next-gen iDrive platform, showcasing how BMW is merging generative AI, adaptive UX, and immersive in-car entertainment to define mobility's emotional, digital future. Korber’s product-led brand strategy—where each launch functions as both a technological showcase and brand statement—has helped modernize BMW’s tone and broaden its appeal. The approach is delivering results: in Q1 2025, BMW posted record EV sales (up 27.9% YoY) and, as of June 6, the company’s stock was up nearly 10% YTD. Lisa McKnight McKnight is steering Mattel’s transformation from toymaker to IP-powered cultural force, redefining how legacy brands thrive. She has oversight of global brand strategy, creative, insights and licensing across the company’s entire portfolio, including for iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO and Masters of the Universe. Under McKnight’s leadership, Mattel has adopted a newly flattened, collaborative model that fuses marketing, media, and design from the earliest stages, resulting in integrated brand narratives that build brand equity by updating the cultural context in which the individual equities show up. From viral Ken doll moments—such as the LeBron James “Kenbassador” collaboration—and Barbie’s art-world crossovers, to Hot Wheels’ limited-edition drops with artists like Daniel Arsham and MSCHF, and UNO’s resurgence fueled by TikTok debates and creator house rules, McKnight’s fan-first, multi-platform strategy taps into nostalgia with fresh creative energy. The result is a slate of reimagined brands that feel both timely and resonant, telling new stories that connect across generations. Her push into experiential marketing, design-driven collectibles via Mattel Creations, and premium brand partnerships has unlocked new revenue streams and pop culture traction, especially among kidults, who are now the company’s fastest-growing audience. In a market where many brands are retreating, McKnight is advancing Mattel’s brand purpose by repositioning toys as art objects, cultural statements, and vehicles for self-expression. As of June 2, Mattel’s stock was up 4% YoY. Elizabeth Rutledge With oversight of the iconic financial services brand’s global brand strategy, media, sponsorships, and customer marketing, Rutledge’s influence has sharpened the company’s all-important brand and identity around service, trust and small business support. Under her marketing influence and leadership, American Express has been building on a legacy purpose-led strategy to drive deeper customer connection and brand differentiation, extended its longstanding support of small businesses with grants delivered through their “Backing Small” platform, helping thousands of independent businesses rebuild from natural disasters and grow for the future. Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion.

Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round. Nvidia hasn’t invested in Vast Data since the company’s Series D. Topics Reporter, Venture From seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.

Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round.

Title: Property prices surge for 20th month in a row piling pressure on new buyers

Stock image Property prices rose again in April, pilling more pressure on new buyers trying to secure a home. It was the 20th month in a row of rising home values. Prices were up by 7.5pc in the year to April, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). This was compared with a rise of 7.6pc in the year to March. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.2pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.6pc compared with April last year. The median price of home bought in the period across the State was €365,000. The highest median price for a dwelling was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €185,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to April was A94 in Blackrock, Dublin, with a median price of €750,000. Castlerea, in Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €148,000. In April, 3,748 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.6bn. These purchases were made up of 2,908 existing dwellings and 840 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,458 first-time buyer purchases in April 2025. In the year to April, 49,352 homes were bought by households at market prices were filed with Revenue. Of these, 18,146 were purchased by first time buyer owner-occupiers. This works out at 37pc of the purchases. Former owner-occupiers purchased 25,907 homes, or 52.5pc of the total. The balance of 5,299 (10.7pc) were acquired by non-occupiers, such as State-supported housing charities and funds. The latest price rises are in the wake of the Central Bank again reducing its forecast of how many houses will be built this year, saying it now expects 32,500 – just 2,000 more than last year. It is the second time this year that the bank has reduced its housing forecast. In March, it lowered the prediction to 35,000 from 37,000. The latest development will heap further pressure on the Government, which has set itself a target of delivering 41,000 homes this year, which now seems unattainable. Even that target is less than what most housing experts say is needed to meet demand and clear the backlog – about 52,000 units a year. The slow delivery of new homes comes at a time when demand for housing continues to surge. Close to one in five consumers in this country are looking to rent or buy, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland said, quoting European Central Bank statistics. Demand for housing in this country is now the second highest in Europe, after the Netherlands. The banking lobby group said 17pc consumers in Ireland, or almost one in five, report that they were looking to rent or buy. This is according to the February 2025 ECB Consumer Expectations Survey.

Don’t be fooled by the bipartisan buzz — the Genius Act is a Trojan horse for centralized power, digital surveillance, and ESG-backed financial control. America is on the edge of a financial cliff, and Washington’s so-called “solution” is yet another clever ploy that could further centralize power and lead to a reduction in freedom. The latest scheme is a bipartisan bill dubbed the Genius Act. The U.S. Senate passed the bill on Tuesday by a vote of 68-30. The bill now moves on to the House, where its prospects are less clear. It’s time for the right to sound the alarm and reject the Genius Act — at least until it offers protections for individual liberty. Supporters of the law claim it will modernize digital finance by issuing new regulations for stablecoins, shoring up assets currently used by millions of people worldwide. But the legislation comes with serious threats to liberty as well. It could ultimately become a backdoor way to create a digital dollar, one that offers minimal privacy protections and is easily controlled by massive institutions unaccountable to voters. Officially named the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act,” the Genius Act aims to bring order and credibility to the booming stablecoin market. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies tied to supposedly “stable” assets like the U.S. dollar. USD Coin and Tether — two of the most widely used — circulate more than $200 billion combined. The bill creates a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, allowing them to operate under either state or federal supervision. Lawmakers believe this approach will boost credibility with consumers and financial institutions. The legislation also forces issuers to disclose their reserve assets, submit to public audits, and comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. That law requires financial entities to implement know-your-customer protocols and anti-money-laundering measures — rules that many stablecoin issuers currently avoid. Most importantly, the Genius Act would force issuers to back their coins with liquid assets, such as U.S. dollars and Treasury securities. For example, for every USD Coin distributed, the issuer would need to maintain $1 in reserves or Treasury bills of equivalent value, ensuring that users can always exchange their stablecoins for dollars. The Genius Act has drawn broad bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers from both parties praise its regulatory ambitions. But behind the applause lie serious risks. The bill lays the foundation for a programmable digital currency system — one that lacks basic protections for privacy and liberty. By granting stablecoins federal recognition and placing them under strict oversight and reserve rules, the Genius Act effectively turns them into government-blessed digital dollars, even if the federal government doesn’t issue them directly. That might sound like progress — if the bill actually protected consumers. But it doesn’t. The legislation includes no safeguards to prevent stablecoin issuers from linking usage to social credit systems, such as ESG scores, or restricting legal but politically disfavored transactions. These programmable currencies could easily reflect the ideological preferences of their creators. RELATED: A brutal wake-up call from America’s most powerful banker Photo by Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images Want to donate to a political cause that a stablecoin company opposes? Expect a digital roadblock. Want to buy red meat, a gas-powered car, or anything else that fails to meet an ESG benchmark? Your money might simply stop working. That’s not science fiction. That’s the likely outcome if Congress fails to add robust consumer protections to the Genius Act. No one needs to use stablecoins — at least not yet. The Genius Act doesn’t eliminate traditional dollars. For now, consumers still have alternatives. But that could change quickly. Stablecoins regulated by the U.S. government offer clear advantages over traditional currency. They move instantly, cost little or nothing to send, and operate around the clock. Because they’re digital, they require no physical infrastructure to create or distribute. In nearly every respect, government-regulated stablecoins outperform paper money. Once the U.S. government legitimizes them and guarantees their safety, adoption will surge. As usage grows, demand for traditional dollars could shrink. The companies issuing stablecoins would gain enormous control over economic life. Financial institutions could even begin phasing out physical currency, leaving those who resist digital money with no practical alternative. That’s why Congress must include strong protections for individual liberty in any bill that accelerates stablecoin adoption. Without those safeguards, Americans may one day wake up to find their economic freedom coded out of existence. One of the primary reasons so many in Washington support the Genius Act is that it would increase demand for Treasury bills, which helps the federal government finance its massive debt. The Genius Act would require stablecoin issuers to back their currencies with cash or U.S. Treasurys. Of the two options, Treasury bills often make more sense for the companies issuing stablecoins. Why? Because Treasury bills pay interest. Washington is drowning in red ink. With over $36 trillion in national debt and counting, the government desperately needs someone to keep buying its IOUs. Stablecoins could offer a trillion-dollar solution. By 2028, the Treasury Department estimates that stablecoin issuers could hold up to $1 trillion in Treasurys, so long as legislation like the Genius Act becomes law. The Genius Act isn’t primarily about innovation. It’s about bailing out a bankrupt government. Even more troubling is who stands to benefit. Major players behind these stablecoins include BlackRock, Fidelity, and other financial giants with deep ties to the globalist ESG agenda and organizations like the World Economic Forum. These aren’t neutral actors. They are ideological enforcers with an appetite for control. Are these the people we want managing the digital currency of the future? Are these the institutions we trust to safeguard our freedoms? It’s time for the right to sound the alarm and reject the Genius Act — at least until it offers protections for individual liberty. If we do not act now, we may soon find ourselves in a nation where every transaction is tracked, every purchase scrutinized, and every dollar you “own” is merely rented from a system that can revoke your access with the flick of a switch.

Title: Microsoft reportedly set to cut thousands of jobs, with sales roles particularly at risk

Microsoft is warming up for more redundancies When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is preparing to cut thousands of jobs as part of its ongoing cost-cutting shakeup as the company continues to spend big on AI. A new Bloomberg report says if confirmed, the layoffs could be announced in early July after the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year end on June 30, 2025. Sales teams could be the worst affected, but the redundancies could span other departments as Microsoft looks to reduce employment-related expenses. The company has already cut thousands of workers off in these post-pandemic years. In May 2025, it cut 6,000 of its workers, equating to around 3% of its roughly 228,000 headcount, in an effort to reduce inefficiencies by removing middle management tiers. A further 305 workers lost their jobs this month, with 14,000 roles affected in 2023 and 2024. In April 2025, Microsoft said it would outsource sales to small and mid-sized customers to third-party firms – an indication of the changes believed to be coming as soon as next month. Despite widespread job losses, Microsoft continues to perform well financially. Last quarter, it reported a 13% increase in revenue to $70.1 billion. It currently holds the title of the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.569 trillion. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! At the time, CFO Amy Hood stated that overall company headcount was 2% up year-over-year, but slightly down quarter-over-quarter, suggesting constant fluctuations. TechRadar Pro has asked Microsoft to confirm plans to lay off workers after the current quarter draws to a close, but we did not receive an immediate response. While highly disappointing for the company's workers, Microsoft employees aren't alone in facing job uncertainty. Key rivals like Amazon and Google have also been making regular adjustments to their headcounts to optimize costs and output.

Workplace Savings was launched to help workers build stronger financial resilience by allowing them to contribute to savings directly as they earn. Over half a million UK workers are now using Wagestream's savings product to save for the first time. This easy access product has an industry leading interest rate of 4.33% and is now broadening its scope to allow external deposits for the first time. Clients in the early access programme went live this week, enabling members to transfer in deposits from their linked bank accounts for easy consolidation of their savings. This feature will be made available to all clients from early July. Katie Duxbury, Head of Pay Services & Wellbeing Benefits at BUPA, shared: "Longer term we can see our employees building saving pots and reversing their money story, moving from borrowers to savers with all the positive mental health benefits that financial resilience brings." One in six UK adults have no savings, and a third have £500 or less. With the traditional financial system stacked against 80% of the working world, those on lower incomes are usually the hardest hit. Workplace Savings was created to change that structure. Partnering with Investec, Wagestream is able to offer this market leading product with no minimum deposit or fees to its members, which is usually reserved for high income earners. Employees have the option to save a monthly fixed amount, or they can switch on Save the Pennies, which rounds down each worker's shift pay to the nearest pound, and adds the difference to their savings. Wagestream first launched in 2018, entering the banking movement with a flexible pay solution, which allowed employees to access and withdraw their pay as they earned it. Fast forward seven years, and it has evolved into a holistic financial wellbeing provider – from flexible pay and high interest savings products, to affordable loans, budgeting, coaching and financial education services. Wagestream is at the forefront of this major shift in the employee–employer relationship, as financial services move beyond traditional institutions into the workplace. Peter Briffett, CEO of Wagestream, said: "With the launch of external deposits, we are entering a new era of next generation workplace financial products. This is just the beginning of the revolution, as we continue to impact the lives of millions of people, with fairer financial services." So far, £38 million has been saved by Wagestream members, providing them with more opportunities for growth, freedom and resilience in their day to day lives. Backed by a social charter and the mission to reduce the poverty premium, Wagestream currently serves more than three million members across 2000+ employer brands. This announcement comes on the back of Wagestream recently announcing a £300 million debt financing facility provided by Citi, to expand the Workplace Loans product to its UK member base. World-leading impact investors, Better Society Capital, Social Tech Trust and Fair By Design, along with renowned venture capital investors, Balderton Capital, Northzone, QED, Smash Capital, BlackRock and British Business Bank, have all invested in Wagestream. About Wagestream: Globally, 3 million people now have Wagestream membership through 2,000 brands – across the U.K., Europe and U.S. – making it the world's most widely-used financial wellbeing provider. Offered through employers, the platform attracts more than 12 million monthly visits, helping members to earn, learn, save, spend and borrow on their own terms, all in one smartphone app. Wagestream is a B corporation, built with a social charter to provide fair financial services.

Title: Report: Microsoft to Lay Off Thousand of Employees Early Next Month

Microsoft is reportedly planning to lay off thousands of employees early next month following the closure of its 2025 fiscal year. According to a report from Bloomberg citing people familiar with the matter, the layoffs will mostly impact sales team, though the timing of the announcement could still change. In May, Microsoft already laid off 3 percent of its workforce, with the job cuts affecting approximately 6,000 people. In January, the company also laid off employees working on security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming.

"*" indicates required fields Δ It’s not uncommon for Microsoft to axe jobs or sunset unprofitable services at the beginning of a new fiscal year. Currently, the company is also investing heavily in developing its AI infrastructure, and it is on track to spend over $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers during its 2025 fiscal year. Unfortunately, Microsoft’s recent job cuts in May primarily affected software engineers, as up to 30% of the code for some of the company’s projects is now being written by AI. And the Redmond giant isn’t the only Big Tech company to reduce its workforce amid the ongoing AI boom. In a note to employees shared on Tuesday (via the Wall Street Journal), Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AI developments will force the company to adapt its structure in the coming years. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” he said. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

Title: Microsoft planning thousands more job cuts aimed at salespeople: Sources

NEW YORK – Microsoft is planning to axe thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, as part of the company’s latest move to trim its workforce amid heavy spending on artificial intelligence. The cuts are expected to be announced early in July, following the end of Microsoft’s fiscal year, according to people familiar with the matter. The reductions will not exclusively affect sales teams, and the timing could still change, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter. The company declined to comment. The terminations would follow a previous round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people and fell hardest on product and engineering positions, largely sparing customer-facing roles like sales and marketing. In April, Microsoft told employees it planned to use third-party firms to handle more sales of software to small and mid-size customers. The tech giant has ramped up its investments in AI, aiming to solidify its leadership as companies across industries accelerate the integration of AI into their products and services to maintain a competitive edge. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said on June 17 that the roll-out of generative AI and agents will reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years. Microsoft has planned a capital expenditure of US$80 billion (S$102.8 billion) this fiscal year, with most of it aimed at expanding data centres to ease capacity bottlenecks for AI services. The company had 228,000 workers at the end of June 2024, 45,000 of them in sales and marketing. Microsoft often restructures teams and announces other changes near the end of its fiscal year, which closes in June.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just got brutally honest about AI — and other bosses may follow his lead

Amazon's CEO just said the quiet part out loud: AI is coming for plenty of jobs — and other bosses may soon follow his lead. On Tuesday, Andy Jassy said in a memo that employees should figure out "how to get more done with scrappier teams" and that the move toward AI would eventually "reduce our total corporate workforce." Amazon, with about 1.5 million workers, is the second-largest private employer in the US. Workplace commentators told Business Insider that Jassy's candor may prompt other leaders to feel comfortable telling their employees who — or what — will replace them. Marlo Lyons, an author and certified executive coach, said Amazon's directness might encourage other companies to follow suit. "I think if you have a big company that's talking about AI, then it does make it easier for smaller companies to talk about AI — this is basically culture modeling," she told BI. "In some ways, it might scare you, but at the same time, it should make you say, 'OK, at least my company's being honest to me about it,'" Lyons said. Other CEOs have also become increasingly transparent about AI expectations, although few have explicitly said it would reduce their existing workforce. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke said in a memo in April that "AI usage is now a baseline expectation," and that before managers make a hire, they must first prove that AI couldn't do the job better. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in December last year that the fintech had stopped hiring because "AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do." Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this month that AI agents were already beginning to act like junior-level coworkers and may soon be able to deliver business solutions. "It'll send shivers down the backs of employees," said Cary Cooper, professor of organizational psychology and health at Manchester Business School in the UK, of the Jassy memo. "I think it'll open it up for HR to now have discussions with senior management about how we deal with this — the introduction of AI in our business." Cooper warned companies should be specific with staff about which jobs might be affected and what retraining opportunities are available, or risk "regrettable turnover" — losing the talent they most want to keep. Thomas Roulet, professor of organisational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told BI that linking layoffs with AI was not new — even if Jassy's openness felt like a turning point. "Firms do not hesitate to use AI as a reason to downsize, whether it is an excuse or an opportunity," he said. "Very often, they downsize before even thinking what they will replace with AI, due to market pressures." "AI is a great scapegoat for a lot of unpopular strategic choices at the moment," Roulet added. "There is enormous pressure on companies to show that they are able to replace employees with AI tools," Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at The Wharton School, told BI. "But the evidence indicates that it is very difficult to do so." Klarna, for example, made headlines in 2022 when the company laid off 700 employees, mostly customer service agents, in favor of AI. In May, the financial services company had to hire some back to improve its services. In Roulet's view, many companies that have already cut jobs in favor of AI were moving too fast. "Unfortunately, many firms think of workforce reduction and engage with such reductions before they even think about AI replacement," said Roulet. "The reality is that bringing in AI into work takes a lot of learning cycles and trial and error — it does not appear clearly overnight." Jump to

Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, believes that one stock market segment will continue to surprise investors with its upside in the next five years. In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says that stocks in the US tech sector will continue to print gains and trade above their fair value in the coming years. According to Ives, the tech sector will witness massive developments in the years ahead, fueled by the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). “My view of tech, if you focus just on valuation, you missed every transformational tech stock in the last 20 years. I believe the market is still massively underestimating what growth is going to look like for the AI revolution in tech… You could say some of these are expensive. You’ve got the next two, three, four, five years, given our view of autonomous robotics, that’s why I think we’re going to be talking about the Nasdaq 20,000, 25,000, over the coming years. And that’s why any type of geopolitical sort of events, we always view as opportunities to own these names cheaper. That’s always been our view in the last 25 years covering tech.” As of Tuesday’s close, the Nasdaq is trading at 21,719 points.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Says AI Will Reduce Corporate Headcount, With Over 1,000 Tools In Use And A Growing Focus On The Technology; More Layoffs Expected After 27,000 Cuts Since 2022

Tech giants are increasingly focusing on advancing AI and looking for ways the technology can be used to boost efficiency and performance. Due to the rapid expansion and adaptation of the technology, companies are relying more on AI for enhancement and, as a result, putting more heed to automating processes to streamline operations. Many companies, on account of the changing dynamics and agility of the market, have laid off their staff to create more resources and space for artificial intelligence. Now, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, warns its employees about jobs being cut in the coming years due to the growing focus on AI. The tech industry seems to be undergoing a significant shift with companies extensively embracing AI and automation to boost efficiency and streamline their operations. Due to this broader trend in the market, we see many of the roles either turning redundant or being replaced by AI, resulting in many tech giants undergoing some major organizational restructuring. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy also seems to be part of the changing trends. In a memo sent to employees, he informed them that the company's corporate headcount is expected to be cut down over the next few years as part of the shifting industry and growing focus on AI advancement across the company. The CEO shared: As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. This is not the first time the company has intended to lay off its staff members. Since 2022, Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees. Recently, the divisions impacted by the job cuts were the devices and service group and the books division. Jassy, while emphasizing that the change is due to a wider adoption of AI and using the technology for further advancement, also took the chance to emphasize the current work the company is doing in this regard. Andy Jassy shared about Amazon's progress in terms of AI, as it has so far developed more than 1,000 AI applications and services. He also took a chance to brag that this is yet only a small fraction of what the company has in store, emphasizing the company's deeper investment in the technology. AI is not only serving to be a tool for advancement and operational efficiency, but also a key driver in the organizational restructuring of many companies today, and we could see even more companies opting in this direction.

Title: Why Hollywood studios are still downsizing
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/06/18/hollywood-studios-downsizing/
Time Published: 2025-06-18T17:29:32Z

By Samantha Masunaga, Los Angeles Times Hollywood’s workforce just needed to “survive ’til ’25.” That was last year’s hopeful mantra for entertainment industry pros battered by layoffs and limited film and TV production. But now as the year approaches its halfway point, a bleaker saying seems apt: “Exist ’til ’26.” Rosy projections of a robust recovery this year have not materialized. If anything, the downturn, at least in terms of employment at the studios, has continued. In recent weeks, three media and entertainment giants — Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global — have said they will lay off staffers. Disney cut several hundred employees in the U.S. and abroad, while Paramount shed hundreds of its domestic workforce and Warner Bros. eliminated several dozen positions. It is yet another sign that the industry is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic and the dual writers’ and actors’ strikes of 2023, while also trying to navigate the changing media landscape. As people continue to cut the cord and viewership of traditional broadcast television declines — taking with it valuable ad dollars — companies are reallocating resources to their streaming platforms. They’re cutting back on spending after massive investments during the so-called streaming wars. And now, economic uncertainty from President Trump’s tariffs has rattled the markets, creating a difficult overall business environment. “We’re going through this squeezing of our ecosystem in Hollywood,” said J. Christopher Hamilton, a practicing entertainment attorney and a professor at Syracuse University who focuses on the business of media. Companies are “trying to find a new normal, adjust to the financial pressures that the global economy is under and also figure out what is the smartest business model and path forward.” It’s a far cry from the hints of optimism some in the industry had toward the end of last year. With the strikes finally in the rearview mirror, and delayed films debuting in theaters and production slowly coming back, the thought was “we’re out of the strikes, we’ll be able to go back to the market, sell and buy,” Hamilton said. Instead, many of the recent conversations he’s had with clients and media executives have been centered on fear and uncertainty. People will tell him that it’s hard to sell a TV show, or that they don’t know if their job will be around in two weeks. The international market has also become more favorable to local content, meaning U.S.-made shows are now heavily competing with homegrown series. “It’s a horrible time in the business from the content creation, content production standpoint,” Hamilton said. “People don’t want to take risks. They’re fearful of losing their jobs.” The idea of “survive ’til ’25” was always a myth, said Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. The issues the industry is facing are long term and disruptive. “The industry is retrenching,” he said. “And there’s going to be a shake-up that lasts for quite a while.” The continued decline of linear TV is one issue nearly all studios are grappling with. Though viewership is down and can drag on a company’s stock price, traditional broadcast TV still makes money, making it important to manage costs and generate profit for as long as possible. That also means job cuts in those areas. Disney’s layoffs hit its film and television marketing teams, television publicity, casting and development as well as corporate financial operations. Warner Bros. cut employees from its cable TV channels. While Paramount did not disclose the departments affected by the layoffs, its co-chief executives acknowledged in a note to staff that the decision came as the company navigates “continued industry-wide linear declines.” Linear TV’s struggles have led media companies to spin off their traditional television assets, including cable networks, into separate entities. Santa Monica-based Lionsgate got the ball rolling in 2023 when it said it would sever its film and TV studio business from its pay cable unit Starz, a transaction that was completed this year. Late last year, Comcast Corp. said it would make a new company consisting of its cable channels, including CNBC, MSNBC and USA Network. Then on Monday, Warner Bros. said it too would split into two publicly traded companies — one entity called Streaming & Studios and a second called Global Networks, that would consist of its cable channels such as CNN, TNT and Discovery. The Warner Bros. split is “an acknowledgment that the idea of building something big enough to compete in the streaming war didn’t work,” said Peter Murrieta, a writer and deputy director of the Sidney Poitier New American Film School at Arizona State University. Moreover, Netflix’s dominance in the streaming space has made many companies reevaluate their plans. “There were already signs pointing to the unsustainability of the number of shows and the number of streamers,” he said. “It’s the aftereffects of trying to compete at the streaming level and thinking that’s the future. Resources were put there, and now they have to retrench.” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger has said as much in comments to Wall Street, acknowledging that the House of Mouse pumped out too many shows and movies to compete against Netflix. The company has since pulled back amid Iger’s call to focus on quality over quantity and to reach profitability in its streaming services, which it achieved last year. The company’s latest job postings now include a number of openings for software engineers. The larger economic environment, too, is of concern to those in Hollywood. In addition to industry-specific concerns about artificial intelligence and the decline of traditional TV and cable, the entertainment business is also grappling with domestic and global financial uncertainty. Paramount’s executives cited the “dynamic macro-economic environment” in its note to employees. “Right now, there is an absolute sense of terror among people in the business that they’ll be out of a job, that the old models aren’t working, that they won’t earn what they once did,” said Galloway of Chapman. “They’re not wrong to be afraid. I think they’re wrong to be as afraid as they are because it’s a retrenchment, and it’s a retrenchment following a gigantic expansion.” White-collar jobs in other industries are also being threatened by technological change, greater investment in AI and retrenchments after pandemic-era hiring sprees. Earlier this year, tech companies such as payment firm Square, Meta, Google and Workday said they would lay off employees. But Hollywood has always been a boom-and-bust industry, Galloway said, noting that in times of change, new opportunities always arise. Jobs in virtual production or AI are becoming more numerous. As studios cut back on their staff, they will still need producers to shepherd shows and films, said Susan Sprung, chief executive of the Producers Guild of America trade group. “These companies aren’t getting out of the business of producing great programming, movies and television,” she said. “If you don’t have as large of an executive team that can help supplement that, it makes it even more important that you have good producers working on every one of your projects.” While the current environment is tough, the industry has always been difficult, and people in this business are resourceful and intentional about their work, said Murrieta of Arizona State. Though it is a trying time, he said, “there’s got to be hope.” ©2025 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

U.S. equities were higher at midday as President Donald Trump again called on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates ahead of today's Fed decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all gained. Jabil (JBL) shares kept adding to their all-time highs when UBS increased its price target by a third, noting that soaring demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products is boosting sales for the electronic equipment firm. A higher price target from Guggenheim sent shares of Oracle (ORCL) up. The analysts argued the software maker's revenue will soar in the next two fiscal years. Shares of USDC stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) advanced after the Senate passed legislation on stablecoins, and that also lifted shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which just announced its own stablecoin-like digital currency yesterday. Zoetis (ZTS) shares fell on a downgrade from Stifel, which said competition will limit revenue for the manufacturer of drugs and vaccines for animals. Shares of Allstate (ALL) declined when the insurer estimated it had $777 million in catastrophic losses last month. Steel Dynamics (STLD) shares dipped after the steelmaker gave weaker-than-anticipated current-quarter profit guidance, although the company did provide a positive outlook for its steel and aluminum operations. Oil futures slid. Gold prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated in a memo to employees this week that the company expects AI to reduce its workforce in the coming years, affecting both white-collar and warehouse workers. The Washington Post reports that Amazon, the second-largest private employer in the United States, is bracing for a significant shift in its workforce as AI technology advances. In a memo sent to employees on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy warned that the company expects AI to reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years, as the technology brings efficiency gains across various departments. Jassy’s memo, which was also made public, highlighted the potential impact of AI on both corporate workers, such as software developers, and employees in Amazon warehouses. He stated that AI would “improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots” in the company’s fulfillment centers. The warning comes amidst growing excitement and concern about the potential of AI to disrupt the job market. Some industry leaders, such as Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, have predicted that unemployment could spike to 20 percent in the next few years due to the rapid development of AI technology. As Breitbart News previously reported, Amodei has dire predictions about the future employment of office workers: The Anthropic CEO said AI companies and the government need to stop “sugar-coating” what will happen next, which he warns could be a mass erasure of jobs in a variety of fields, and the axing of half of all entry-level white collar jobs, which Amodei says will lead to a 10-20 percent spike in unemployment in the next one to five years. “We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,” Amodei said. “I don’t think this is on people’s radar.” “It’s a very strange set of dynamics, where we’re saying: ‘You should be worried about where the technology we’re building is going,’” the Anthropic CEO added, acknowledging that he is building the very technology he suspects will soon and swiftly transform society. While economists have generally found that previous waves of AI and automation technology had little overall effect on employment, the latest advances in AI have prompted suggestions that this pattern may be changing. A recent drop in the number of computer programmers has fueled speculation that AI is already beginning to impact the job market. Amazon, along with other large tech companies, made significant layoffs in 2023 after hiring sprees during the coronavirus pandemic. Since becoming CEO in 2021, Jassy has focused on doing more with less, creating a money-saving metric called “cost to serve” to drive down the company’s expenses in delivering goods and services to customers. In his memo, Jassy encouraged employees to embrace AI and to educate themselves about the technology to remain competitive in the changing landscape. He wrote, “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.” The memo also highlighted Amazon’s own AI products, including chatbots for shopping, tools for generative AI ads, and Alexa+, an AI-enhanced version of the company’s virtual assistant Alexa.

Title: DeepSeek Inside: Origins, Technology, and Impact

The release of DeepSeek V3 and R1 in January 2025 caused steep declines in the stock prices of companies that provide generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) infrastructure technology and datacenter services.28 These two large language models (LLMs) came from a little-known Chinese startup with approximately 200 employees versus at least 3,500 for industry-leader OpenAI.2,14 DeepSeek seemed to have developed this powerful technology much more cheaply than previously thought possible. If true, DeepSeek had the potential to disrupt the economics of the entire GenAI ecosystem and the dominance of U.S. companies ranging from OpenAI to Nvidia.5,6 DeepSeek-R1 defines itself as “an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI, specifically based on the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) architecture.”a Here, DeepSeek acknowledges that the transformer researchers (who published their landmark paper while at Google in 2017) and OpenAI developed its basic technology. Nonetheless, V3 and R1 display impressive skills in neural-network system design, engineering, and optimization, and DeepSeek’s publications provide rare insights into how the technology actually works. This column reviews, for the non-expert reader, what we know about DeepSeek’s origins, technology, and impact so far. The parent of DeepSeek is High-Flyer, a quant hedge fund founded in 2015 in the city of Hangzhou, China.b It relies on AI and machine learning (ML) for stock-trading decisions. The cofounder, Liang Wenfeng (born 1985), is a graduate of Zhejiang University. He studied machine vision and started the company with two classmates after researching the topic since 2008. High-Flyer is reported to have 113 employees and $59 million in revenues while managing $8 billion in assets.11,c During 2019–2022, High-Flyer spent approximately $139 million and stockpiled 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs to build a supercomputer. The A100 is lower in performance than the datacenter-standard Nvidia H100 (the U.S. government banned both for export to China in October 2023).9,24,29 In 2021, the Chinese government began a regulatory crackdown on high-frequency speculative stock trading. In response, Liang created a second team of researchers to focus on fundamental AI and ML research. He hired graduates from top Chinese universities and worked closely with Chinese academics. The team evaded government scrutiny because it was separate from the investment group and not focused on consumer AI.9,25 In 2023, High-Flyer spun off this second team as DeepSeek (see the accompanying table). One year later, the new company released products and reports that attracted worldwide attention. (In March 2025, the Chinese government also named DeepSeek a “national treasure” and placed travel restrictions on key employees.26) What made headlines was DeepSeek’s claim, based on a technical report published on its website dated December 27, 2024, that the company spent merely $5.6 million training V3. DeepSeek also claimed V3 approximated or exceeded the performance of other leading LLMs (Qwen 2.5–Alibaba, Llama 3.1–Meta, GPT-4o–OpenAI, Claude 3.5–Anthropic). The cost was so low because V3 required only 2.788 million hours of pre-training and post-training, done on a cluster of 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs (the lower-bandwidth version of H100, permissible for export to China), at an estimated cost of $2/hour. By contrast, to train GPT-4, it is reported that OpenAI used a cluster of 16,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs and spent at least $100 million.12,29 It had generally been accepted that companies need to spend $100 million to $1 billion to train their LLMs.11 The higher number covers variations, such as the nine different versions of Meta’s Lama 3.d It probably did not cost much to develop R1 once DeepSeek had V3.1 However, DeepSeek has not revealed the separate development costs for R1 or its predecessors and variants. We also do not know how much hardware High-Flyer and DeepSeek had access to in addition to the supercomputer. The research firm SemiAnalysis estimates DeepSeek had access to as many as 50,000 Hopper-class (probably H800) Nvidia GPUs and, for V3/R1, spent more than $500 million on GPU hardware and about $1.3 billion in total development costs.9 These estimates, which seem to be approximate guesses made in hindsight, would be comparable to development costs for the reasoning GPT models from OpenAI and the Llama 3 series from Meta. The December 2024 technical report also states that, “During pre-training, we train [sic] DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T high-quality and diverse tokens.”8 One token equals approximately four characters or 0.75 English words. Fifteen billion tokens are approximately the amount of high-quality text available on the English-language Internet. It is also the estimate for pre-training tokens Meta used for Llama 3 and twice the estimate for OpenAI’s GPT-4 of 6.5 trillion tokens.10 In other words, training on DeepSeek-V3 reportedly took many fewer hours and much less money than comparable LLMs but covered a similar or much higher level of content. Sasha Rush concludes as well that V3’s performance is comparable to OpenAI GPT-4o but with substantially less training costs, while R1 resembles an open source version of OpenAI-o1, which had been the market leader for reasoning LLMs.22 Reasoning LLMs generate better answers if they run more computations in the inference (question-answering) stage. The reasoning approach works particularly well when there are correct answers the system can check against and provide rewards for, like in mathematical modeling, coding, or logical reasoning.22 DeepSeek built R1 as a reasoning version of V3 and released two smaller versions of R1 based on distillations of the open source Llama 3 (Meta) and Qwen 2.5 (Alibaba).7,21,e V3 consumed the bulk of the engineering work but R1 is important because it showed DeepSeek that “reasoning emerges as a behavior from pure reinforcement learning.”19 Here we see a difference in training strategy. OpenAI built its reasoning models by starting with human-supervised fine-tuning and then using reinforcement learning, followed again by extensive human fine-tuning. By contrast, DeepSeek skipped human pre-training and allowed the model to improve its reasoning capabilities by learning on its own (that is, reinforcement learning with rewards) and then a few hours of human post-training. As it built R1, DeepSeek also enhanced V3 through rounds of reinforcement learning, with rewards and verifications of answers. V3 and R1 used the same training data, and the V3-base model is inside R1. However, R1 benefitted from this “distillation” of learning from V3. Moreover, designing R1 to show the reasoning process made it easier to fine-tune.22 Part of the explanation for the low-cost, high-performance of V3/R1 is DeepSeek’s follower position and access to open source technology.20 But equally important seems to be DeepSeek’s technology and training strategy. Most experts cite the clever architecture and multistage training, with human fine-tuning only in a post-training phase. In particular, three complementary approaches and supporting techniques balanced engineering cost and system performance: Mixture of experts, reinforcement learning, and distillation. Mixture of experts (MoE) and supporting techniques. MoE architectures use several small specialized language models to spread out the data analysis and training load. Different prompts or “weights” call up specialized experts that, of the total parameters available, access only a small subset, such as 37 billion out of 671 billion parameters in R1. Accessing a subset of parameters, called Sparse Neural Network Training, avoids redundant or unnecessary calculations. By contrast, GPT-4 appears as a “dense” neural network with access to 1.8 trillion parameters for every operation.16 The MoE concept is not new but has been difficult to scale.22 The French startup Mistral AI did release in December 2023 the “open-weight” MoE LLM 8x7B, with eight experts (two operational at any given time), each accessing a total of 166 billion parameters and resembling a “scaled-down GPT-4.” Apparently, it was innovative and efficient but did not garner the same attention as the efficient and low-cost DeepSeek V3/R1.13 DeepSeek relied on specific techniques to minimize compute resources needed to share data across the smaller experts. It used parallelization to coordinate the computational tasks running on different clusters of networked computers (GPUs). It used quantization to improve computational efficiency by limiting the precision of calculations (decimal points) to the lowest level necessary for a specific computation.22 Examples would be converting 32-bit floating-point numbers to 16-bit, 8-bit, or even integer (whole-number) formats. Reinforcement learning (RL) and supporting techniques. The RL approach focuses on ML via trial and error with rewards for particular outcomes, in R1’s case, accuracy and format of the answers. OpenAI and other reasoning LLMs also use reinforcement learning and rewards.18 However, OpenAI has relied heavily on supervised training by human experts that requires enormous amounts of data and time for pre-labeling the data sets and feeding the system questions and correct answers.16 DeepSeek says it used human supervision only in post-training to fine-tune its models and spent very few hours.8 In general, the analogy would be to train a computer to play chess by giving it the rules on how to move pieces and then letting the machine learn mostly by playing matches rather than pretraining with insights from a human grandmaster.11 Other techniques complemented RL. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning divides a large, complex problem into intermediate steps that are easier to analyze and refine.17 DeepSeek used RL and CoT training to turn V3 from a relatively simple LLM into the more sophisticated reasoning R1 by asking it to show the steps used to analyze and answer questions.21 Another complementary technique is group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Many LLMs incorporate a slow and expensive training approach with a “policy model” (rules or guidelines) to decide on actions and then a separate “critic model” to evaluate those actions. GRPO skips the critic model step by taking groups of scores (data from several actions) and learning by comparing the scores.29 In the R1 white paper, DeepSeek reported: “we use DeepSeek-V3-Bases as the base model and employ GRPO as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning … We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems.”7 DeepSeek also used multi-token prediction (MTP) during V3 pretraining to improve data efficiency, noting: “Instead of predicting just the next single token, DeepSeek-V3 predicts the next two tokens through the MTP technique … which we have observed to enhance the overall performance on evaluation benchmarks.”8 Distillation. This approach uses a large “teacher” model to transfer knowledge to train or fine-tune a smaller “student” model. The smaller model requires much less memory and compute time to operate, and can be faster during the inference stage. For example, the teacher model can transfer prediction outputs that serve as instructions for how to answer specific types of questions, saving the student model from the extensive training and computations normally required to arrive at those instructions.17 There have been suggestions that DeepSeek distilled outputs or acquired proprietary data from OpenAI models, but there is no evidence of this.22,23 DeepSeek used a distillation of R1 for post-training of V3 to add some reasoning capability and it used V3 to help train R1.8 DeepSeek also experimented with small versions of R1 trained on distillations of the open source Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3. These distilled versions performed better than a preliminary model (DeepSeek-R1-Zero), despite being much smaller, though they did not perform as well as R1.19 The DeepSeek team offered two conclusions regarding this combination of distillation and reinforcement learning as well as the limitations of their approach: “First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL … require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning.”7 DeepSeek optimized V3 and R1 for different tasks. V3 does very well on standard benchmarking tests for logic problems and code writing. R1 is better at deeper reasoning and math.12,16 Both V3 and R1 are said to be comparable or better than LLMs from Anthropic (Claude) and xAI (Grok), though still behind Google (Gemini).11 Chatbot Arena at University of California Berkeley publishes a ranking where R1 came in third, matching the performance of ChatGPT-4o.3 The cost to access V3 and R1 application programming interfaces (APIs) is so low that DeepSeek has disrupted the economics of the LLM API market.4 In early 2025, DeepSeek priced V3 at $0.07 per million input tokens and $0.11 per million output tokens, and R1 at $0.55 for input and $2.19 per million output tokens. By contrast, OpenAI priced GPT-4o at $15 per million input and $60 per million output tokens (prices that were approximately half of what OpenAI had charged earlier).29 Price-performance has made DeepSeek very popular among open source developers and all major cloud service providers support access. In China, car manufacturers, local governments, hospitals, state-owned enterprises, and private companies have embedded DeepSeek into their applications. Tencent has incorporated DeepSeek into its search engine for WeChat and the Chinese version Weixin. Baidu uses DeepSeek in its search engine. Other major companies such as Huawei, NetEase, Bytedance/TikTok are also users.15 In the U.S., AMD has integrated DeepSeek-V3 into its Instinct MI300X GPUs to optimize AI inference and GPU performance.28 However, some countries (the U.S., Australia, South Korea, India, Italy, and Taiwan) have warned about Chinese ownership or prohibited usage on government devices.27 There has been concern that DeepSeek’s low prices could commoditize GenAI technology and lead to steep drops in company sales. But another potential outcome is Jevons Paradox—the observation that improvements in efficiency and lower prices do not necessarily lead to falling revenues.3 If demand is sensitive to price, then usage and sales could increase dramatically as more people access the less expensive product or service. So far, Jevons Paradox seems to be holding up: Demand for GenAI software and GPU hardware continues to rise. Reasoning LLMs are improving and likely to find many more applications. Debates continue around the significance of DeepSeek’s innovations. Dario Amodei, cofounder of Anthropic and former VP of Research at OpenAI, describes DeepSeek’s achievement as mainly an important advance in engineering efficiency. He sees V3/R1 as part of a shift already underway from a focus during 2020–2023 on expensive and time-consuming pretraining, running software on ever-more-powerful and expensive hardware, to more economical machine-based reinforcement learning, sometimes with less than state-of-the-art hardware.1 However we view DeepSeek, it seems noteworthy that a Chinese startup, operating under American export constraints, has demonstrated clever ways to balance cost and performance in LLM development. DeepSeek’s open source code and sharing of detailed information has already made GenAI technology more accessible and understandable.

Title: “...In Kiambu county, there are different things being done”: A qualitative exploration of healthcare workers’ experiences with cord care practices

Full Content:
Neonatal sepsis (NNS) continues to be a leading cause of neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. NNS can occur secondary to umbilical stump infections (omphalitis) and this requires preventative cord care practices. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued context-specific recommendations for the use of 7.1% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution in areas with high neonatal mortality. Despite adoption of this policy, monitoring and evaluation of this guidance is lacking. This study describes the experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding cord care practices in Kiambu County, Kenya. We employed an exploratory qualitative design. Key informant interviews were conducted with 38 HCWs between October 6th and November 9th 2022 in six healthcare facilities in Kiambu County. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo software. While Ministry of Health guidelines endorse WHO’s recommendation for the nation-wide use of CHX for neonatal cord care, its implementation in Kiambu county remains varied. HCWs continue to favour surgical spirit, and one of the healthcare facilities in our study adopted a facility-based policy of dry cord care. HCWs also relayed that mothers often combined modern and traditional methods. Some HCWs reported high satisfaction with CHX due to its perceived effectiveness, ease of use, and faster stump healing. However, systemic and product-specific barriers to uptake were noted. Systemic issues included frequent CHX stock-outs and high out-of-pocket costs due to inconsistent county-level supply and lack of insurance coverage. Product-specific concerns such as difficulty of application and reported adverse effects (e.g., delayed cord detachment, sepsis, burns) further impeded use. Knowledge gaps and contrary instructions among and between both the HCWs and mothers also undermined CHX use. Despite CHX being the recommended intervention for cord care in Kenya, its inconsistent use in Kiambu county reflects gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health education. The persistence of outdated or non-recommended cord care practices underscores a critical lack of oversight. To realize CHX’s full public health potential, urgent policy action is needed to ensure consistent availability, enforcement of national neonatal guidelines, and investment into inclusive IEC materials. Bridging the gap between policy and practice is essential for reducing neonatal morbidity and achieving equitable progress towards Kenya’s goal of Universal Health Coverage.

Neonatal sepsis (NNS) is a significant cause of neonatal mortality during the first month of life [1]. One of the primary contributors to NNS is the development of omphalitis, which is the infection of the umbilical stump [2]. This infection often arises as a result of improper and/or inadequate umbilical cord care practices, which can ultimately lead to neonatal mortality in up to 15% of cases [1]. While this is relatively uncommon in developed nations, it is a significant contributor to neonatal mortality in developing nations [1], such as Kenya. Due to this burden of NNS secondary to omphalitis, the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided context-specific recommendations for newborns in settings where: (1) harmful traditional substances are prevalent and (2) the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) exceeds 30 in 1000 live births [3]. This recommendation is based on a meta-analysis of individual patient data, involving 177 neonates from five trials with a total of 129,391 newborns [3]. CHX for cord care has been shown to reduce NMR by up to 23% and prevents infection by 38–68% [4]. Furthermore, observational studies from low-income countries suggest that replacing harmful traditional cord care practices with antiseptics could save many newborn lives use [5,6]. However, this recommendation remains tentative due to the lack of data on sepsis and an inadequately described search strategy in the systemic review cited [5,6]. Moreover, the exclusion of observational studies from low-income settings (due to the absence of randomized controlled trials) limits its relevance for LMICs. The recommendation of dry cord care for LMICs that otherwise meet the criteria is therefore questionable, especially since the Cochrane review itself found no significant difference in infection rates between placebo and antiseptic use [5,7]. Kenya has a 29.3% prevalence of NNS [8], and the incidence rate of omphalitis is estimated at between 20–77 of every 1000 live births of newborns delivered within healthcare facilities [9]. The incidence rate of omphalitis is purported to be higher in at-home births [9]. The NMR has been documented 21 deaths per 1,000 live births, accounting for 66% of infant deaths and 51% of under-5 deaths [10]. However, this NMR varies widely between the counties of Kenya. A 2018 study conducted in Machakos County revealed that, of all the admissions in the newborn unit, 34% constituted cases of NNS and were associated with 15% of the deaths reported [9]. WHO’s recommendation for the contextual use of CHX for cord care is a transition from the previous recommendation of the use of surgical spirit [11], a recommendation which was also reflected in Kenya’s 2009 National Guidelines for Quality Perinatal Care [12]. Surgical spirit is no longer recommended for umbilical cord care due to its limited efficacy in preventing infections, potential to irritate newborn skin, and the availability of safer, more effective alternatives like CHX [11,13–15]. In 2016, however, the Government of Kenya recommended the use of CHX in all births to ensure equal standards in healthcare provision for all citizens of the country [16], therefore adopting the new WHO guidelines nation-wide [17]. Since Kenya’s adoption of the WHO recommendation on the use of CHX in all neonates in 2016, the implementation has been set to take three phases: (1) preparation, (2) planning, and (3) execution. Expounded, this process includes the alignment of policy, developing guidelines, introducing the product, training of service providers, generating demand for the product, and finally, monitoring and evaluation (M&E). A 2016 study by Muriuki et al. found that HCWs in rural Kenya widely accepted the use of CHX for umbilical cord care, citing benefits such as faster healing, reduced infections, ease of use, and positive community feedback [18]. For successful scale-up, they emphasized the need for community sensitization, proper training, consistent supply, clear guidelines, and inclusive service delivery approaches [18]. However, a 2021 cross-sectional study at Kangundo Level 4 Hospital found that while most mothers received some education on CHX use, both mothers and HCWs demonstrated poor understanding of its proper application [9]. Different counties are expected to have achieved different levels of adoption given that healthcare in Kenya is devolved to the county level with the national level providing policy guidance. Given that Kenya has a goal to further increase the uptake of CHX treatment to above 80% in all health care facilities by 2026 [4], the adoption of CHX for cord care has yet to undergo M&E through the perspectives of HCWs. The CHX uptake in Kiambu county is 40.1% [18], and therefore, understanding HCW experiences with cord care practices in the county would be essential to shape health policy and highlighting gaps in its implementation. The study adopted an exploratory qualitative design using key informant interviews (KIIs) guided by semi-structured question guides, and which were conducted between 6th October 2022–9th November 2022. The data was collected from six health facilities in Kiambu County. This study was carried out in Kiambu County, Kenya, which has a population of over 2.4 million people. The location coordinates are 10 10’S 36050’E, and it neighbors six other counties, namely Nairobi City and Kajiado Counties to the South, Machakos to the East, Murang’a to the North East, Nyandarua to the North west, and Nakuru County to the West [19]. The county is 60% urban and 40% rural due to its proximity to the capital city Nairobi. The county has 505 health facilities, comprising 108 public, 64 faith-based, and 333 privately owned facilities. In Kenya’s health system, Level 1 refers to community-based services (e.g., health promotion and preventive care), Level 2 to dispensaries, Level 3 to health centers, Level 4 to sub-county hospitals, and Level 5 to county referral hospitals. Maternity services are typically offered at Level 3 (health centers) and above, including private and faith-based hospitals. Therefore, this study gathered insights from HCWs working in Level 3, 4, and 5 public facilities, as well as private hospitals. One of the Level 5 hospitals (Thika Level 5 Hospital) in this study also functions as a teaching hospital for medical and nursing students. CHX for newborn umbilical cord care is available in two formulations: gel and solution [20]. Both forms are recommended by the WHO and are included in the Kenya Essential Medicines List as well as in postnatal care guidelines [20–22]. In line with this, Kenya’s Ministry of Health (MoH) endorses the availability and use of both CHX formulations [20]. The choice between the dosage formulations used depends on what is acceptable to mothers, caregivers, HCWs and availability [23]. According to the national guidelines, immediately post-delivery, a HCW should apply CHX to the newborn’s umbilical cord using sterile gloves. The antiseptic is applied to the base, stump, and tip of the cord [20]. For gel formulations, the HCW uses their index finger to spread it; for the solution, the dropper is used to apply CHX directly. The CHX is not cleaned off after application. In the postnatal period, CHX should be applied once daily until the seventh day or until the cord naturally detaches: whichever happens first. Mothers and/or caregivers are instructed on how to apply CHX at home following the same procedures, but in lieu of sterile gloves, they are advised to thoroughly wash their hands before each application. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), now defunct, but which was active during the period of the study, had a program called Linda Mama that covered the costs of antenatal care (ANC), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) for all pregnant women [24]. However, it notably excluded the cost of CHX, and currently, there is no government-sponsored program providing CHX free of charge to mothers during the postnatal period. The study population consisted of over 2,600 HCWs providing health services in Kiambu County during the study period. No formal sample size was calculated and we applied the information saturation principle [25]. Two providers were targeted in every unit (with a target of 30 HCWs) during the study’s formulation, however some units were understaffed during the study and hence only had one HCW interviewed. The cadre and respective facility of the sample are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326506.t001 Inclusion criteria - HCWs who had direct interactions with neonates or were involved in providing or handling CHX cord antiseptic during the study period, and who had at least 6 months of experience with cord care. Exclusion criteria - HCWs who were not directly involved in newborn care or who declined to provide informed consent and who had less than 6 months of experience with cord care. A total of 38 KIIs were conducted between 6th October 2022 and 9th November 2022. All interviews were conducted by two members of the study team, JMG and BNO, both holding Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degrees. JMG serves as the Kiambu county pharmacist and holds a PhD in pharmacy, while BNO is a researcher with experience in qualitative data analysis. Both researchers received training prior to data collection to ensure consistency and quality. The interviews were conducted in English, but participants were allowed to respond in either English or Kiswahili. BNO, who is bilingual and fluent in both written and spoken English and Standard Kiswahili, translated the KIIs, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim directly from Kiswahili into English when applicable. Each participant was assigned a unique index number (1–38), and quotations are referenced using the format: HospitalName_Cadre_IndexNumber. Kobo Toolbox software was used to collect and manage data, with all data coded to conceal the participants’ identities. To ensure data security, electronic data collected via KoboCollect were encrypted and password-protected on the devices. After transfer, data files were securely stored on password-protected computers and backed up on a secure cloud platform with restricted access. NVivo project files were similarly protected to maintain confidentiality and data integrity throughout the analysis process. Interview transcripts were imported into NVivo software to assist in the classification, sorting, and coding of data into central themes and subthemes. The coding process followed a two-cycle approach. In the first cycle, value coding was used to capture participants’ attitudes and values, reflecting their perceptions and experiences. The second cycle involved focused and pattern coding. Focused coding developed specific categories without focusing on their properties, while pattern coding grouped similar codes into meaningful units for theme identification [26–28]. NVivo’s platform played a crucial role in facilitating this multi-level coding process, ensuring consistency in the analysis framework by identifying recurring patterns and connections. The research questions and interview guide informed the coding frame, allowing for accurate classification of notable data segments to reveal dominant themes. The integration of value, focused, and pattern coding in both cycles ensured a comprehensive and structured analysis of the interview data [26–28].BNO, JMG, and PKJ also independently reviewed the transcripts to familiarize themselves with the data and identify initial codes. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion to ensure consistency and reliability. Upon arrival at the various study sites, verbal consent was initially sought from the manager of each facility unit, followed by written consent from the hospital medical superintendent. Prior to the initiation of data collection, participants were informed about the study’s objectives and their role as respondents. They were assured that participation was entirely voluntary and that they had the right to withdraw at any time. All data collected by the researchers were treated as confidential and utilized exclusively for this study. Access to the materials was restricted to the investigators, and stringent data management protocols were implemented to uphold the confidentiality of the study subjects. Approval was obtained at various administrative levels, including county and sub-county authorities before the study commenced. Ethical clearance was secured from the University of Nairobi/Kenyatta National Hospital Ethical Review Committee [P470/05/2022], County Government of Kiambu Department of Health Services, Kiambu County [KIAMBU/HRDU/22/09/14/RA_GITHINJI], and a research license was obtained from the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation [NACOSTI/P/22/20446]. A total of 38 HCWs were interviewed, as depicted in Table 1. The mean age of respondents was 35.6 years (Range: 23–57 years). The HCWs interviewed had a mean of 9.4 years of professional experience, with a median of 7.5 years, a mode of 7 years, and a range spanning from 0.5 to 30 years. In terms of time spent at their current stations, the average was 4.4 years, with a median of 3 years, a mode of 1 year, and a range from the minimum of 0.5 years to 22 years. Participants had an average practice duration of 9 years. The transcripts drawn from recordings of KIIs held with selected HCWs were analyzed, and themes emerged as 33 files with 52 references. Some themes mirrored the guiding questions in the semi-structured questionnaire, as shown in the coding tree as Fig 1. The numbers in brackets indicates the total number of individual references that mention that specific code within the files.

National policy recommendation We sought to understand the general cord care practices in various health facilities across Kiambu County by interviewing HCWs. According to MoH guidelines, the use of CHX for cord care has been officially recommended, with the directive being disseminated from the central government to the county level. This was confirmed by a participant from Nazareth Hospital, who stated, “first of all, we have the policy that is an order that came from Kiambu County from the Ministry of Health that chlorhexidine should be used” (Nazareth_Pharmacist_25). The majority of participants acknowledged the existence of the MoH guidelines recommending CHX for cord care, confirmed that this policy had been communicated to health facilities and gave a description of the same policy in their responses. “So after birth, when you cut the cord, immediately we use the chlorhexidine, and after, we use it once a day, once a day after delivery until now the mothers goes home and you instruct them to use it until the cord dries off and falls off.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “…the next thing is to maintain hygiene of the cord, and this is done by applying an antiseptic. Commonly we use chlorhexidine, either the gel or the solution.” (Kiambu_ Paediatrician_36) “...The guys from the [MoH] when they come, they say, “No, you must use [CHX]. You must use [CHX]...” (Thika_Midwife_13) 2. Facility-level departures from national recommendations HCWs mentioned that surgical spirit remained the predominant choice in practice, indicating a reluctance to fully transition from previous guidelines. In fact, almost half (41.7%) of participants reported having prior experience with surgical spirit before being required to switch to CHX, which was a new product in their facilities. Some facilities reported not using CHX at all, relying solely on surgical spirit for cord care. This variation in practice highlights the need for further investigation into the slow adoption of CHX in these settings, despite the existence of formal guidelines. Furthermore, despite clear directives, Thika Level 5 Hospital actively deviated from the National Guidelines, opting instead to follow its own facility-based protocol of dry cord care. “Here in our health facility... We discussed with our pediatrician and we just decided to leave the cord just like that. Don’t put anything, don’t put water, don’t put the spirit, and don’t put chlorhexidine, as long as you keep it clean. And we have not had any case of sepsis... The guys from the [MoH] when they come, they say, “No, you must use [CHX]. You must use [CHX].” But then we are agreed for us, we don’t use it here, we have not been using it, and we have not had any cases of neonatal sepsis.” (Thika_Midwife_13) “So the current cord care practice in Thika Level 5 I would say, predominantly because that’s where I practice is dry cord care. I hardly do surgical spirit or chlorhexidine or any other medication directly with the cord.” (Thika_ Paediatrician_12) “And what I’ve noted, there is less uptake of chlorhexidine use for cord care compared to the surgical spirit.... the pediatrician and also other practitioners [are] persistent on the use of surgical spirit as opposed to chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_ANC-nurse_23) “So currently, in Kiambu County, there are different things that are being done … some places and institutions that are using chlorhexidine for cord care. Then a number of institutions are using surgical spirit. There are some people who even believe on doing nothing to cord care. There are people who are using normal saline for cord care.” (Thika_ Paediatrician_37) “…I just know most of the time, they don’t even use that chlorhexidine. They use surgical spirit.” (Kihara_Pharmacist_18) 3. Mothers’ use of blended and traditional cord care methods A minor theme emerged in which some HCWs reported that mothers used multiple cord care methods, often influenced by either their past experiences or family advice, or both. For example, if surgical spirit had been ineffective with their first baby, they would switch to CHX for subsequent children, and vice versa. In some cases, mothers who delivered during the era of previous guidelines recommending surgical spirit continued to favour it. Other practices included the use of saliva, a traditional method still common in our context. “There is the use of … saliva, especially for the traditional mothers” (Ruiru_PNC-nurse_5) “One challenge is that mothers out there, they have other methods of doing cord care. When you teach them how to do it, they go at home and they’re taught by other relatives how to do it … Like they will buy spirit because the other baby they used spirit, or they will use another thing like savlon that’s hindering proper use of the chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_ANC-nurse_23) “some mothers are resistant to change, especially those who delivered much earlier and chlorhexidine was not there before. So if they used spirit, they still want to use spirit … or even using saliva or cow dung.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “The common challenge that we face is that mothers believe in the use of some traditional methods like use of saliva.” (Ruiru_Midwife_6) The preferences that HCWs had for CHX in cord care were varied, largely shaped by their clinical and anecdotal experiences with different methods. Approximately half of the HCWs who expressed satisfaction with CHX did so primarily due to its perceived effectiveness in preventing omphalitis and NNS. This ultimately reduced the need for additional healthcare visits for both mothers and newborns. Many HCWs in favor of CHX also highlighted that it promoted quicker stump healing compared to other methods, provided that mothers followed proper instructions, maintained good hygiene, and began cord care immediately or shortly after birth. Additionally, CHX was praised for being easy to use, contributing to its widespread adoption and positive outcomes. “So far, the outcomes have been good. We have had limited cases of sepsis after the use of chlorhexidine.” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “… those who practice, okay, cord care with chlorhexidine as they are instructed, the outcome is good.” (Kihara_Midwife_16) “The use of chlorhexidine for cord care has made work easier in Kiambu since it’s easy to use and its availability, its efficacy being high has made it easier for us to manage the newborns and their mothers are even happy with the healing process using chlorhexidine gel.” (Kiambu_Pharmacist_34) “The effectiveness of cord care is better compared with [traditional or surgical spirit] methods … in comparison with the mothers that have been using the surgical spirit and the cord care, during the postnatal checkup one week post-delivery, the mothers who have been using the chlorhexidine, the cords are healed faster compared with other methods.” (Ruiru_PNC-nurse_5) 1. Systemic barriers One of the most significant barriers to the adoption and provision of CHX for cord care was its inconsistent availability in government health facilities. This challenge of access was twofold: not only was there a shortage of government-supplied CHX to health facilities, and when it was available, its cost often priced consumers out of the market. Many mothers at the facility found the cost of CHX prohibitive. As a result, HCWs recommended more affordable alternatives, which hindered CHX’s widespread adoption and led mothers to choose cheaper options like surgical spirit. “…And then the erratic supplies for the county, particularly because of those financial constraints the counties have been having have made it easy for us to try out other things because in the absence of chlorhexidine, what else was being done to allow cords to heal... the supplies and the county, it’s quite irregular. The stock-outs are very, very, very common because of the budgetary constraints in the county.” (Thika_ Paediatrician _12) “The first challenge is limited resources from the county. That is, when receiving our delivery from KEMSA, we might also be able to receive chlorhexidine. Another challenge is from the patients. Once the drug is prescribed, some patients may not be able to purchase from the pharmacies outside.” (Kihara_Pharmacist_24) “The challenges of provision of chlorhexidine gel, first of all, I’d say it’s not readily available. As in, even if I sent a mother outside here to buy, I don’t think it’s as available as there rest. Secondly, the cost. It’s a challenge because the mothers are not able to afford it” (Githunguri_ANC-nurse_33) 2. Perceived product-specific disadvantages Some HCWs associated CHX use with delayed cord healing, sepsis, and prolonged cord detachment. In a few instances, they reported that neonates had returned to the hospital with infections after its use. Concerns also emerged over the varying CHX formulations, which caused confusion, particularly due to its resemblance to tetracycline eye ointment and challenges in proper application. The drop formulation was especially scrutinized, with some HCWs believing it contributed to sepsis and soft tissue burns. Their perceptions of CHX's effectiveness were largely shaped by mothers’ feedback. These second-hand accounts reinforced the belief that CHX was less effective than other cord care methods, ultimately influencing its use within health facilities. “…The [CHX] drops, the mothers are coming back with septic cords. I don’t know whether it’s the hygiene at home or what. I don’t get. But when we get a mother that comes and then we take the history, they say they bought the drops. But with the gel, no, not much sepsis. But with the drops, there is.” (Kiambu_Midwife_35) “Now, the problem with the gel was that either it was too thick and it kept leaving the cord moist, and so it would take longer for the cord to drop off … So, a lot of children would come with delayed cord dropping.” (Thika_Paediatrician_12) “Initially, we used to use the chlorhexidine gel, which was a bit difficult to use because it required one to wash their hands or change their gloves, apply the gel on their finger, and then spread the gel on the cord and surrounding skin. The gel could also be confused with tetracycline eye ointment because of the kind of packaging it came in. However, with the solution, it's much easier to use because all one needs to do is to drop a few drops on the umbilical cord and leave the baby's cord to dry. The packaging is also very different from the tetracycline eye ointment, so confusion is reduced.” (Kiambu_Paediatrician_36) 3. Inconsistent use instructions The data corpus revealed a significant knowledge gap among HCWs and mothers regarding the use of CHX for cord care, with some indicating that it should be applied once a day but others recommending it twice a day. HCWs often demonstrated preferences for alternative practices, reflecting a reluctance towards the adoption of CHX. These gaps were primarily due to insufficient HCW training on CHX application, leading to a lack of awareness among mothers about proper usage. “… the mothers need an education. There are mothers who will not want to use chlorhexidine gel because of mythical thoughts or superstition, or that’s not what they were taught by their mothers to use. So, sensitization is needed … we need to sensitize the healthcare workers because sometimes we have found mothers who have not used chlorhexidine gel because the physician who was working with the mother did not believe in the working of chlorhexidine gel.” (Kiambu_Pharmacist_34) 4. Inertia Among HCWs, the knowledge gap regarding CHX use is further complicated by resistance to switch from surgical spirit, which many have successfully used in the past. This resistance is often rooted in personal experiences with both products. HCWs tend to favor surgical spirit, largely due to their familiarity with it and the perceived shortcomings of CHX. “I think the fact that most of the healthcare workers were used to surgical spirit, the switch to chlorhexidine and the fact that it takes time, the cord takes time to heal, I think most people are still reluctant to start mothers on the gel. They’ll prefer surgical spirit.” (Kihara_PNC-nurse_15) HCWs underscored the need for increased awareness and education among both HCWs and patients, citing persistent knowledge gaps regarding CHX’s benefits and proper usage. Many recommended improving accessibility by including CHX in maternity packages or ensuring its consistent availability in hospital pharmacies, thereby enabling timely application immediately after delivery, which is a critical factor for its efficacy. Affordability also emerged as a central concern, with suggestions to reduce the cost of CHX and incorporate it into health insurance schemes such as (formerly) Linda Mama to alleviate the financial burden on mothers. Furthermore, HCWs advocated for comprehensive training programs targeting midwives, doctors, and pediatricians to deepen their understanding of CHX. Such training would enable healthcare providers to more effectively counsel patients, thereby promoting greater uptake of CHX in cord care practices. “Yes. So number one, it’s the cost. It is readily available to them considering that it is covered by NHIF, number one...” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “Suggest that the hospital should source for more of the drug to ensure that it’s constantly available for use to increase its uptake. Interviewer: If it was available, do you think everybody would use. Interviewee: Yeah.” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “I think we need proper training for the staff, especially in maternity, even for us working in the postnatal clinics, because I understand the gel should be started immediately after birth.” (Kihara_PNC-nurse_15) “The other one is educating, first of all, the healthcare worker on how to use it so that the healthcare worker is empowered to also educate the mothers on how to use it.” (Thika_Pharmacist_11) IEC materials depicting the application of CHX were found to be largely unavailable and inadequate in healthcare facilities. A significant majority of respondents (86.1%) reported that these materials were inaccessible in most hospital units, resulting in ineffective promotion of CHX utilization. In cases where materials did exist, they were often not suitable for illiterate women, who frequently resorted to traditional methods of cord care. To address this gap, HCWs suggested developing more inclusive IEC materials, such as pictorials and patient-friendly infographics, to ensure that all mothers could benefit from the health education provided. These materials included charts, pictograms, and illustrations that use inclusive language. using accessible language. These patient-friendly IEC materials should be strategically placed in locations such as antenatal clinics and labor wards, so that mothers are informed about the importance of CHX and can prepare to obtain it before delivery. HCWs also recommended tailoring resources specifically for their needs, including physical charts as reminders at workstations, along with Continuous Medical Education (CME) sessions and training programs. Observations made by the participants included the following: “But in the facility in Githunguri, I’ve not seen any [IECs]. And I think CME is about the chlorhexidine would really help in creating awareness… everywhere, in every ward, in the postnatal rooms, and in labor ward, and also here in antenatal.” (Githunguri_PNC-nurse_29) “On the issue of IEC materials, they’re not available in our facility. If they can be effective and brought down to the facilities, I would recommend they be more pictorial. By a glance, someone is able to know what it is and how it can be used and the readings big enough to be legible.” (Githunguri_ANC-nurse_33) “The IEC material would help the staff here be at least more conversant for those who are not conversant with chlorhexidine gel, its use, its application, the period which the patient is supposed to use... Through the information the staff acquire, they’ll be able to make more informed decisions of even escalating the matter to facilitate the increase of the supply of the chlorhexidine gel in the facility and also acts a refresher …as opposed to other previous methods that were used of cord care…The IECs are not available at the facility at the moment...” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “For the charts, they should be bigger, and they should provide more charts so that we can put maybe in the wards and to educate the mothers. And for those mothers who are illiterate who cannot read, the wordings are many than the pictures. The pictures are better illustrating of how to use the chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) This study explored the experiences of HCWs in Kiambu County regarding newborn cord care and revealed significant deviations from Kenya’s national guidelines which recommends the blanket use of CHX for all neonates nationwide. Despite the increasing adoption of CHX, with 41.7% of HCWs reported transitioning from surgical spirit, outdated and potentially harmful practices such as the use of surgical or methylated spirit persisted in our set-up. One facility in our study, Thika Level 5 Hospital, adopted its own facility-based practice of dry cord care. Our findings suggests that the national policy on CHX has not been fully implemented or embraced in practice, underscoring the need for strengthened policy adherence and education. The participants in this study reported diverse experiences with the use of CHX for cord care. Key concerns included the cost of CHX products, delayed healing, and varying perceptions of its effectiveness. The cost of CHX, which was quoted between Ksh. 120–200 (USD 0.93 to 1.55), was perceived as expensive by some clients, particularly when compared to more affordable alternatives such as methylated spirit (Ksh. 50, USD 0.34) or dry cord care, which incurs no cost. This contrasts with the findings of Opanga et al., who reported that CHX gel was available at less than Ksh 40 in private facilities and pharmacies, and was free in public hospitals, yet with only a minimal uptake of 1.3% [29]. Another study conducted in rural Bungoma county found that CHX was provided free of charge to mothers after delivery, but noted that improper use and misunderstandings regarding its application negatively impacted uptake, along with echoing concerns about delayed cord separation [30]. The variations in participants’ experiences with CHX use in Kiambu County may reflect the unique socio-economic and health system dynamics of a peri-urban area situated near the capital city. While Kiambu’s proximity to Nairobi may suggest better access to health information and services, it also presents a complex interplay between urban and rural health-seeking behaviours. Unlike rural Bungoma, where CHX was provided free and uptake issues were mainly due to poor understanding or instructions, Kiambu residents may encounter CHX more frequently through private pharmacies or clinics where it is sold at significantly higher prices, making it prohibitive to lower-income households despite theoretical availability. Furthermore, price discrepancies between public and private sectors may indicate a lack of standardized pricing or public awareness about where to obtain CHX for free. This is supported by the findings of Opanga et al., which noted low uptake despite free availability in public hospitals [29]. This demonstrates a disconnect between policy and implementation, possibly fueled by inadequate dissemination of information, lack of health worker engagement, or supply chain challenges in public facilities. Despite these challenges, our results also highlighted positive feedback from HCWs, particularly around the ease of use, prevention of sepsis, and faster cord separation, suggests potential benefits. This echoes a participant in Opanga et al.‘s study who reported early cord separation, with the cord drying and detaching after just three days, highlighting the promise of CHX in improving neonatal outcomes when used appropriately [29]. The majority of HCWs interviewed indicated challenges in the provision of CHX due to systemic challenges of unavailability. The inclusion of CHX in the Kenya Essential Medicines List was intended to enhance its availability in the public sector, and this highlights a gap in enforcement of this directive in our context [22]. The overarching goal of healthcare systems is to ensure that all patients have consistent access to a comprehensive range of suitable, high-quality, and affordable essential medicines, as emphasized by the WHO [31]. Essential medicines are critical components of healthcare, recognized alongside clean water, safe food supply, and adequate housing as fundamental necessities; their absence constitutes a failure to uphold universal human rights [32,31]. However, essential medicines frequently experience stock-outs in developing countries [32,31]. In Kenya, where health services are devolved (the national government “shares” government functions with smaller county governments), the impact of these stock-outs varies across the different counties. To mitigate the occurrence of stock-outs for essential medications on the package list, it is crucial for public sector facilities to ensure timely payments to the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) for their orders [33,34]. Conversely, non-public facilities report infrequent stock-outs due to differing and strengthened procurement processes. Stock-outs were also identified as a significant concern by Ambale et al. at Kangundo Hospital [16]. Consequently, participants reported a lack of sustained experience with the products, which undermined their confidence in persuading mothers to purchase them upon leaving the healthcare facilities. Furthermore, to achieve optimal coverage, particularly for economically disadvantaged families, subsidization may be necessary [35]. The aforementioned issue raises a critical discussion about the disconnect between policy and implementation under Kenya’s devolved health system. It highlights that simply listing a drug as essential is not enough without effective supply chain management, accountability structures, and financing mechanisms at the county level. The situation in Kiambu highlights how inconsistent availability of essential medicines like CHX undermines provider confidence, policy adherence, and public trust, all of which contribute to missed opportunities for preventing neonatal infections and deaths. Moreover, the inequity between public and non-public facilities, where the latter have more consistent procurement systems, underscores the urgency of reforming public sector logistics and financing flows: particularly timely disbursement of funds to suppliers. Without these structural changes, the promise of universal health coverage and improved neonatal outcomes will remain unrealized. This discussion also sets the stage for recommending policy enforcement mechanisms, decentralized budgeting reforms, and stronger accountability for county health departments, as essential steps toward resolving persistent stock-outs of life-saving commodities. HCWs reported inadequate training in CHX cord care, leading to significant knowledge gaps and unfamiliarity with recommended guidelines. This resulted in variations in the reported frequency of CHX application. This finding aligns with another Kenyan study, which linked the lack of training and clear instructions to the ineffectiveness of CHX gel [16]. To address research-driven shifts, standardized guidelines for CHX use are essential. Ongoing medical education for all cord care personnel is crucial. Participants also emphasized the need for increased media publicity to enhance consumer knowledge, in line with the sensitization efforts recommended by Opanga et al. [29]. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), 89.2% of births in Kiambu County occurred in hospitals, with 98% of these deliveries attended by medical professionals [36]. This rate is notably higher than the 54% and 64% reported in Pemba (Tanzania) and Zambia, respectively [37,38]. However, having a medically assisted delivery does not necessarily guarantee a reduced risk of infection, as many medical centers in our context fail to meet minimal infection prevention standards [39]. Furthermore, potentially hazardous procedures that raise concerns in home delivery settings are often performed on women and infants before they are discharged within hours of birth [15]. While Kiambu’s high institutional delivery rate might suggest optimal conditions for newborn cord care, this can create a false sense of security if not paired with stringent infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. It challenges the assumption that health facility births inherently reduce neonatal infections and points to the critical role of CHX as a safeguard, even within supposedly safer environments. This further reinforces the WHO’s position on universal CHX application, emphasizing that the presence of a skilled birth attendant does not automatically equate to safe neonatal outcomes: especially in under-resourced or overstretched facilities. Integrating CHX as a routine part of postnatal care, regardless of delivery setting, can act as a simple, cost-effective buffer against systemic IPC failures, especially in high-volume facilities that discharge mothers and newborns within hours of delivery. Most HCWs in our study suggested several strategies to enhance the uptake of CHX. IEC is crucial for ensuring correct usage, infection control, patient safety, and adherence to best practices. Participants emphasized the importance of recommending CHX to mothers and providing education on its proper use. These sentiments are echoed in the existing literature as this resistance to CHX has been previously described in similar settings [13,30,40–42]. Both the quantity and quality of IEC materials on CHX need improvement. Visual aids and illustrations should be prioritized over text to enhance mothers’ understanding of proper CHX use. Our study found that, while most health facilities had some IEC materials on CHX, these resources were limited and lacked engaging illustrations to support learning. This finding aligns with those of the Bungoma County study [30], and further highlights a pressing need to improve these materials for HCWs. While participants rightly identified the aforementioned methods as key to increasing CHX uptake, these strategies cannot succeed without a robust and context-sensitive health communication framework. The limited, often text-heavy IEC materials reported in this study reveal a missed opportunity to engage mothers, many of whom may have low health literacy or limited formal education, in ways that resonate with their daily realities. This challenge calls for a shift from generic IEC content to co-designed, visual, and language-appropriate tools that accommodate all literacy levels. Devolution in Kenya offers both a challenge and an opportunity: counties like Kiambu can tailor CHX strategies to their unique population needs, but this must be done in alignment with national guidelines and messaging, to ensure consistency and avoid confusion. This requires capacity-building for local health workers, investment in community engagement strategies, and partnerships with trusted media outlets to amplify accurate, culturally resonant messages on CHX use. Ultimately, the effectiveness of CHX as a public health intervention depends not just on availability, but on how well it is communicated, understood, and trusted at the community level. The mixed perceptions, inconsistent use of CHX for cord care and the use of alternative cord care methods in Kiambu County reveal a deeper systemic issue that extends beyond individual preferences: it points to critical gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health communication. The fact that one of the facilities included in our study practice cord care contrary to national guidelines is particularly concerning and highlights a lack of oversight and accountability in guideline implementation. To ensure CHX fulfills its potential as a low-cost, high-impact intervention for preventing neonatal infections, there is an urgent need for policy action at both county and national levels. This includes: (1) strengthening the enforcement of national neonatal care protocols across all facilities, (2) ensuring uninterrupted availability of CHX through timely procurement and subsidization, and (3) developing and disseminating culturally appropriate, visually driven IEC materials to improve community understanding and uptake. As Kenya advances toward Universal Health Coverage, it is imperative that essential medicines like CHX are not only listed on paper but made reliably available and appropriately used at the point of care. A unified, well-supported CHX strategy will not only align with WHO recommendations but also directly contribute to reducing neonatal morbidity and mortality: especially among the most vulnerable populations. This must begin with aligning policy intent with health system practice.

That’s already showing up in the numbers: Over the past year, Meta, for example, has raised revenues by 22% while only hiring 10% more people. Alphabet grew revenues by 14% without any net new hires. Sure, Nvidia did grow headcount by 13%, but for good reason—sales exploded by 126%. Microsoft, meantime, saw 16% revenue growth on just a 3% headcount increase. Tech firms are the thin edge of the wedge here. Other companies are going this way, too. This is where dividends come in because we can easily buy this trend through closed-end funds (CEFs) that: Here are three you can blend to get this sweet income (and gain!) setup. We’ll start with a “pure” tech fund and move through to one focused more on AI users than providers.

STK also holds Visa (V) and fuel-cell-maker Bloom Energy (BE). Let’s call those “tech-adjacent.” STK sells call options on part of its portfolio, which generates extra income to support its 6.3% dividend. This strategy works well with tech stocks, as they tend to be more volatile. Moreover, portfolio manager Paul Wick has 38 years of experience and it shows: In the last five years STK’s total return has outpaced the NASDAQ, which we all know has been on a tear: STK Total Returns One thing to remember is that STK is on investors’ radar, so it trades at a premium to NAV. But that premium is well below the peaks it’s hit in recent years, making STK something of a bargain in disguise. That premium could turn some folks who don’t know STK’s history away, providing an opportunity to step in. The Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX), as the name says, holds NASDAQ stocks. But unlike index funds, it pays a big dividend: 8.5%. Like STK, QQQX fuels its payout, in part, through option sales. QQQX’s portfolio of NASDAQ stocks includes the tech kingpins, plus firms like travel site operator Booking Holdings (BKG) that also benefit from “growth without hiring.” The fund’s 5.7% discount gives us another tailwind as it narrows and (likely, in my view) flips to a premium—something it’s long overdue for: QQQX Discount NAV Now let’s add more “tech-adjacent” holdings with … The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (GDV) rounds out our trio with a focus on innovators from across the economy—particularly finance stocks—set to cash in as they integrate AI into their businesses. Top holdings include Mastercard (MA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and American Express (AXP). GDV yields 6.5% and is the steadiest payer of the bunch, with a payout that hasn’t been cut since the 2009 financial crisis. The fund’s discount has been stuck in double digits in recent years, but it has been narrowing lately. I expect that discount to keep shrinking as AI optimizes sectors like finance. That would slingshot the fund’s price higher, adding gains to that 6.5% payout. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

June 18, 2025 08:38 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK,, June 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/DV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Diamond Comics' Claim AENT Poached Staff "Fails As A Matter Of Law"

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, AENT, diamond AENT says that Ad Populum's claim against them for poaching staff from Diamond and breaking NDAs "fails as a matter of law" Once upon a time, Diamond Comic Distributors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and held an auction to divide its assets. Alliance Entertainment (AENT) won that auction, with Universal Distribution and Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop coming second as joint bidders. The courts (eventually) declared AENT the winner, but they suddenly pulled out, citing that they had been misled. So the back-up bidders won the auction, with Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop taking Diamond Comic Distributors while Universal got other associated companies. AENT then sued Diamond, alleging fraud over contracts. Then Ad Populum sued AENT, alleging the breaking of NDAs and non-hiring agreements, after AENT hired seven senior former employees of Diamond. Those staff members were: Now, AENT is making the case with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore that Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop has no legal standing to enforce the NDA, as it was not a party to the agreement nor assigned its rights. And claims that the NDA was signed between AENT, Diamond, and Diamond's bankruptcy lawyer, Raymond James. AENT notes that a cease-and-desist letter sent on the 2nd of June, seen below, came from Diamond, not Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop. They state that "prior to the Auction, AENT entered into the NDA with Raymond James, on behalf of itself and DCD. The NDA was entered into because AENT 'requested certain information (oral, written, electronic or otherwise) relating to or concerning the Company, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates.' The NDA recognized that AENT signed the agreement 'for the benefit of [DCD] and Raymond James and their respective successors and assigns.' The Complaint does not allege that DCD or Raymond James assigned the NDA to Sparkle Pop. Nor did the Debtors assign any rights under the NDA to Sparkle Pop as part of the sale transaction. In fact, the asset purchase agreement between the Debtors and Sparkle Pop expressly states that no contracts are being assigned to Sparkle Pop." They also note that Ad Populum's own evidence proves that AENT did not solicit Diamond's former employees and that Diamond's "internal records reveal that most of the employees in question were terminated as part of a mass-layoff on May 16, 2025, or were seeking alterative employment opportunities months before they resigned, as employee morale tanked and instability permeated." AENT Bruce Ogilvie makes a declaration, which is included in the filing under oath, backing much of this up, saying "Prior to the Auction, AENT entered into a non-disclosure and non-solicitation agreement with Raymond James & Associates, Inc, on behalf of itself and Debtor DCD. Importantly, Ad Populum is not a party to the NDA. When I signed the NDA on behalf of AENT, it was an agreement between AENT and DCD and its subsidiaries. There are no third-party beneficiaries. Further, the Debtors did not assign any rights under the NDA to Sparkle Pop as partof the sale transaction. In fact, the asset purchase agreement between the Debtors and Sparkle Pop expressly states that no contracts are being assigned to Sparkle Pop." "Indeed, counsel for Debtors sent my attorneys a letter, dated June 2, 2025, incorrectly claiming certain alleged breaches of the NDA by AENT caused by AENT's employment of certain former employees of DCD. AENT denies such allegations and maintains that its actions did not violate the NDA or interfere with the business of any party, including Sparkle Pop. It is noteworthy that the letter did not come from Sparkle Pop, but rather DCD and its related Debtors—the only parties to and intended beneficiaries of the NDA." The legal response is summed up, saying "the Complaint and the Motion… fail as a matter of law." There's more, much more to come, of course. Including how my work for Bleeding Cool is being cited in this case. Well, you know how I like to make everything about me, right? But for now, that cease and desist letter. You can use these Diamond, AENT, and Ad Populum tags to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool. Here's a timeline if you want to catch up… Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!

Morris Kandinov is investigating Virtu Financial regarding possible breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of law on behalf of shareholders. The class action lawsuit alleges that: (i) the company maintained deficient policies and procedures with respect to its information access barriers; (ii) accordingly, Virtu had overstated the company’s operational and technological efficacy as well as its capacity to block the exchange of confidential information between departments or individuals within the company; (iii) the foregoing deficiencies increased the likelihood that the company would be subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny; and (iv) as a result, defendants’ public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.

After eliminating nearly 27,000 jobs in 2023, Amazon is preparing for another round of layoffs. This time, the job cuts stem from the rapid growth and efficiency of AI. "As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to employees. The memo didn't specify the departments that would be impacted, but it highlighted AI agents as key to the company's future. They can engage in deep research, write code, and "change the scope and speed at which we can innovate for customers," Jassy said. Currently, Amazon has over 1,000 generative AI services and apps in progress. In the future, the company hopes to use agents that can act as "teammates that we can call on at various stages of our work," Jassy added. The Amazon executive didn't provide a timeline for the layoffs. He, however, stated that efficiency gains from AI will reduce the company's total corporate workforce in the next few years. Jobs of some warehouse workers and delivery agents may also be at risk. The company started testing humanoid robots at a Seattle warehouse in 2023. These robots could move, grasp, and handle items just like human workers. More recently, the e-commerce giant was rumored to be testing similar robots for doorstep delivery. The robots are expected to hop on the back of a Rivian van and step out to drop off packages. The Prime Air drone service, on the other hand, has already begun delivering iPhones, Galaxy phones, AirPods, and more in less than 60 minutes in eligible areas. In April, Duolingo had also announced AI-driven job cuts. CEO Luis von Ahn wanted to make the language learning platform an AI-first company and gradually stop using contractors for work AI can handle. However, after facing backlash from users, von Ahn backtracked on his plans, stating, "I do not see AI as replacing what our employees do." Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Amazon CEO says AI set to take jobs due to "efficiency" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has announced advancements in AI, and the technology's integration across many of the company's operations, will likely reduce the firm's headcount over the next five years due to efficiency gains. In a letter to workers, CEO Andy Jassy boasted that more than 1,000 AI services and apps area already in progress or built, and many more are to come. Jassy name-dropped a few of the successful deployments and upcoming rollouts, including its next-generation smart personal assistant Alexa+, the AI Shopping Assistant, seller tools and advertiser tools. Ultimately, artificial intelligence could end up changing the nature of work, requiring fewer people in some roles but more in others. The ecommerce giant has already laid off an estimated 27,000 workers since 2022, including recent cuts in devices, services and books divisions, but it seems that widespread tech layoffs could be far from over for Amazonians. AI has also proven instrumental in allowing Amazon to improve its inventory, forecasting, robot efficiency and customer service, but Jassy's letter remained consistent with one key theme – a strong emphasis on internal productivity improvements through the use of generative and agentic AI. With capabilities spanning task completion, research, code writing and workflow automation, Jassy sees AI agents are critical for faster innovation and better customer experiences, however the downside of that is that the tech will enable leaner teams to achieve more, reducing the need for as many workers. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite the threat of AI taking their roles, Jassy urged workers to be "curious" about the tech, experiment and innovate with it, and further their learning. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.," Jassy explained. "It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce." Jassy's comment about knowing where this nets out in the future is a relevant one. Although many experts predict that AI could lead to net job creation, it could mean that some companies (like Amazon) end up reducing their headcount, while others see growth.

Title: Employees were already freaked out about AI — Amazon just proved them right

The once-hypothetical cuts are coming, whether employees are ready or not. On Tuesday, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, confirmed the fears of many workers in the age of artificial intelligence: He said he expects the technology will lead to job cuts at the tech giant. In his memo, which was posted online, Jassy did not announce immediate layoffs. He said that, in the next few years, "efficiency gains" from AI would translate to a smaller corporate workforce. Marlo Lyons, a certified executive coach, told Business Insider that jobs will inevitably change — including outright disappearances. "So is your job at risk? Absolutely. If you don't get on board with AI, yes, absolutely, you're going to lose your job." Amazon is now one of the largest companies to explicitly state that AI will impact its employees' jobs. BI previously reported that roles that include tasks that AI can perform are disappearing from job boards faster than positions that have fewer tasks that AI can accomplish. Shopify's CEO said in April that, before hiring anyone new, employees must prove AI can't do the job better. Duolingo plans to phase out contractors and replace them with AI. And Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, has said that the company might not hire engineers in 2025 because those already on the payroll are getting so much more done thanks to AI tools. The industry you're in matters. Office workers appear to be particularly at risk. In late May, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, suggested AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said earlier this month that he expects the impact of AI on white-collar jobs to be so significant that it will lead to a recession. Christian Schneider, the CEO of New York-based startup fileAI, told BI that he's already seeing job losses in corners of the tech industry, and he expects AI to exacerbate the trend. "I'm totally expecting a tightening," he said. "I think when we look into tech layoffs, it's so apparent that something is changing." Melissa Swift, the founder and CEO of work consultancy Anthrome Insight, told BI that productivity hasn't always increased to the same degree as tech advances. It often "ticks up slowly, like a kiddie roller coaster going up the first big hill." Those who aren't keeping up risk being left behind. And refusing to acknowledge the risk doesn't make it go away, Lyons said. "So if you're redesigning the workplace, and how things are getting done — whether it's a workflow or structures of teams, or the same thing with AI — you can hold on with white knuckles, but it's still going to happen around you," Lyons said. Of course, not all the jobs affected by advancements in AI will mean the workers filling them will be laid off. Jassy acknowledged in his statement that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs." Schneider said some jobs will change so that typical back-office, rote tasks will fall to AI and allow more workers to take on people-facing roles. Or, officegoers once responsible for pulling and preparing data might now move to the end of the process to, for example, check the quality of the results AI produces. While some jobs will disappear and others will evolve, Schneider said, workers are often good at adapting. "Honestly, I wouldn't want to underestimate people's drive," he said. Jump to
