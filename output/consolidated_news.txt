The Southeast Asian country of Malaysia is getting another multibillion-dollar investment from U.S. Big Tech, the latest in the region’s drive to capitalize on the AI boom. On Wednesday, Oracle announced it would invest at least $6.5 billion toward a public cloud region in Malaysia. A cloud region is the real-world location where cloud facilities are located. Oracle said the new facilities would enable its customers in Malaysia to leverage AI services, and help Malaysian organizations modernize their digital applications. “Malaysia offers unique growth opportunities for organizations looking to accelerate their expansion with the latest digital technologies,” said Garrett Ilg, Oracle’s executive vice president and general manager for Japan and Asia Pacific, in a statement. Malaysia’s minister of investment, trade, and industry said Oracle’s investment will support the country’s ambitious plan to create 3,000 smart factories by 2030. Oracle’s cloud investment follows a similarly sized pledge from Amazon. In late August, the U.S. company’s cloud computing division promised $6.2 billion in investment for Malaysia. Microsoft and Google have also announced multibillion-dollar investments in Malaysian cloud infrastructure. Malaysia is working to position itself as a tech hub in Southeast Asia. In addition to data centers, Malaysia is courting semiconductor investments in a bid to move up the chip supply chain. The country is working on a national cloud office and AI strategy, Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Tuesday at the groundbreaking ceremony for Google’s new $2 billion data center complex. The U.S. company claims the investment will create 26,500 jobs and generate $3.2 billion in economic activity by 2030. Other Southeast Asian economies are attracting cloud-related investments. In May, Amazon pledged to invest $9 billion into its existing cloud infrastructure in Singapore by 2028. The Southeast Asian city-state has been a regional data hub for the U.S. company since 2010. On Monday, Google said it will invest $1 billion in Thailand to build a new data center and expand the country’s cloud infrastructure. Microsoft also says it has a “significant commitment” to build new cloud and AI infrastructure in Thailand, according to CEO Satya Nadella in May. Microsoft is promising $1.7 billion in cloud- and AI-related investment in Indonesia, as well. The investment in Southeast Asia’s data centers is part of a global push to invest in computing capacity to fuel new AI services. Last month, a consortium of companies including Microsoft and BlackRock pledged to mobilize $100 billion in capital to invest in new data centers. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

As tensions rise in the Middle East, commodities like gold and crude oil are seeing notable price increases, while Bitcoin has taken a downturn. This divergence has reignited debates over Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset. According to a report by Martin Young for Cointelegraph, on Tuesday, gold surged by 1.4%, reaching $2,665 per ounce, close to its all-time high. Meanwhile, crude oil prices spiked by 7% to $72 per barrel. These gains came after airstrikes across Israel, with Israeli air defenses intercepting most of the 180 missiles launched. Bonds and the U.S. dollar also saw gains, further signaling investor anxiety. “Investors are seeking refuge in gold amidst the uncertainty in the Middle East,” commented Li Xing, Financial Markets Strategist at Exness. Contrary to its usual label as a “safe haven,” Bitcoin dropped more than 3% over the same 24 hours, falling from an intraday high of $64,000 to a low of $60,315 before slightly recovering to $61,800. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $61,693, down 3.5% in the past 24-hour period. Coinglass data reported that around 154,770 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations amounting to $521 million. According to Reuters, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that Iran’s missile attack on Israel was unsuccessful and promised a response. He remarked that Iran had made a significant miscalculation and would face consequences. Netanyahu emphasized that the Iranian regime underestimated Israel’s resolve to defend itself and retaliate against its adversaries. This isn’t the first time Bitcoin has reacted negatively to geopolitical conflict. A similar drop occurred in April following a drone attack by Iran on Israel. Some analysts, like Jeroen Blokland of Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, believe that investors are selling Bitcoin to buy gold. Meanwhile, Adam Cochran and Jesse Colombo have questioned Bitcoin’s reliability as a safe haven, although the former’s comments may have been partly made in jest. Precious metals, by contrast, tend to perform better during such crises. Colombo argued that Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset similar to tech stocks, which also fell. The best analyses are based on one day of data Now, juxtapose Bitcoin's intraday chart with gold:https://t.co/VmrayqxDNn However, it is worth noting that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested in July 2023 that Bitcoin could still serve as an alternative hedge against inflation. Larry Fink today said he hopes SEC “looks at their ETF filing as a way to democratize crypto and make it cheaper.” Also says bitcoin is international asset, new gold.

China is Russia's biggest war backer, BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink said on Tuesday. Fink spoke at a panel at the Berlin Global Dialogue conference when he said that Western businesses need to re-evaluate their relationship with China. "Russia's biggest supporter and fundamental supporter of the Russian economy is China. And that has to be at least discussed," Fink said. "Each country, each company, has to reassess what that means, and I'm not here to make any judgments, but I don't believe there's been enough assessment." Earlier in the panel, Fink expressed surprise that there hasn't been a "larger questioning or demanding" of China's support for Russia amid the latter's war with Ukraine. "You're supporting our enemy, we're putting billions and billions of dollars into supporting the survival of Ukraine, and there should be a cost to that," Fink said of China. Fink told dialogue attendees that China's continual backing of the Russian economy also means BlackRock may need to review its operations in the Chinese market. "We have businesses in China, I'm sure everybody here has some businesses in China," Fink said. "We all have to re-evaluate that, like we have to re-evaluate a risk in liquidity traps, a risk in everything," he added. Representatives for Fink at BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours. China has been a critical lifeline for Russia as it continues to struggle under the West's crippling economic sanctions since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In 2023, Russia and China's bilateral trade hit a record $240 billion, per Chinese customs data. "Russia's economy is suffering long-term setbacks, and the country is sealing its fate as China's economic vassal," CIA director William J. Burns wrote in an opinion article for Foreign Affairs in January. To be sure, China has been trying to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. China has claimed to be neutral when it comes to the war in Ukraine. In February 2023, China unveiled a 12-point peace plan, but that was rejected by Russia. In July, Finland's President Alexander Stubb told Bloomberg in an interview that Russia's reliance on China means the Asian giant could end the Ukraine war if it wanted to. "I argue that Russia is so dependent on China right now that one phone call from President Xi Jinping would solve this crisis," Stubb told the outlet. "If he were to say, 'Time to start negotiating peace.' Russia would be forced to do that. They would have no other choice," he continued. Jump to

Simonsen also helped guide Stella McCartney through its shareholder transition, when McCartney exercised her option to buy back Kering’s 50 percent stake in her brand in 2018, then sold a minority stake to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton a year later. SMCP is in the process of restructuring its operations and global network balance. It is looking to grow its business in new territories including India, Indonesia and the Philippines after retreating from China following several quarters of declining sales there. The SMCP group operates about 1,600 stores in 46 countries. Business in the U.S., Canada and Mexico has been stronger, with sales up nearly 9 percent in first-quarter results reported earlier this year. It is expanding its footprint in the region, including opening a new Sandro store in Montreal later this month. SMCP itself is undergoing a shareholder change. Holding company Glas, which is serving as the trustee for creditors including funds BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan, was just given the green light to sell its shares by the London High Court. The anticipated Glas sale would position SMCP as ripe for a potential takeover bid.

Title: What is Databricks?

Time Published: 2024-10-02T04:39:03Z

By: John Miner | Updated: 2024-10-02 | Comments | Related: > Azure Databricks Databricks, Inc. is a data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) company founded by the original creators of Apache Spark. The Platform as a Service (PaaS) has evolved over the years with support on Microsoft Azure and Amazon cloud-based platforms. Databricks purchased six companies to add features to its offerings, such as ML OPS, Data Governance, and Generative AI. As a new data engineer, how can I quickly get up to speed using the Databricks platform? At the core of Databricks' offering is the Apache Spark Engine. Initially, this engine was written in Object Oriented Java (Scala). However, the demands of big data have increased, requiring additional speed. Databricks added Photon to the Runtime engine. Photon is a new vectorized engine written in C++. The image below shows the traditional offerings from the Spark Ecosystem. These four areas will be covered at a summary level today. I suggest trying to use the Photon engine due to its speed. The image below is from the Databricks website. Just remember that this offer comes at an additional price. Check to see if you meet both your SLAs for data processing and monthly operating expenses (budget). Our manager has asked us to provide a high-level overview of the Databricks ecosystem to our senior management. The company has a large amount of data in an aging on-premises data center. The goal is to understand what is Databricks and associated ecosystem for business intelligence, data analytics and decision making. The above table outlines the topics that will be discussed in this tip. One nice feature about Databricks is that it can run on all three major cloud vendors (AWS, AZURE, GCP). Regardless of the technology, engineers refer to the data plane and control plane. The control plane is where coding and scheduling can be done. Most services depend on a cluster, the distributed computing power for Spark. See the architecture diagram below for details. Data engineering is just a fancy name for the extract, transform, and load (ETL) logic packaged in a workflow (job). The use of each step is up to the end user. I might extract (read - data source) from an Azure SQL database and load (write - data destination) to a parquet file using Spark Dataframes. Typically, when dealing with a data lake, one uses medallion zones. The quality of data improves as you go from left to right. The above image was taken from a Microsoft Technical Community article by Mike Carlo. There are two ways to work with files in Apache Spark: Let's start with two sample CSV files that contain weather data. The goal of this exercise is to read the high temperature and low temperature CSV files. Let's join the two dataframes and save them as a Parquet file. The above code loads the low temperate data into a dataframe named df1. The code below loads the high temperate data into a dataframe named df2. The code below writes the results of joining the two tables to a Parquet file. Any duplicate columns are deleted from the results. The syntax for the dataframes has a little learning curve. The PySpark code above was executed on a single node cluster. Without a cluster, no work gets done. The same ELT process can be coded using Spark SQL. The Spark language supports the following file formats: AVRO, CSV, DELTA, JSON, ORC, PARQUET, and TEXT. There is a shortcut syntax that infers the schema and loads the file as a table. The code below has a lot fewer steps and achieves the same results as using the dataframe syntax. The SELECT statement retrieves the first 5 records from the weather table located in the default database schema. There are two types of hive tables: managed and external tables. Regardless of table type, the DELTA file format is the only one that supports ACID transactions. Any INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements executed by the end user against another file format will result in an error. The ACID properties of the DELTA format are achieved by using Parquet data files, Parquet check point files, and JSON transaction logs. To recap, data engineering within Databricks can be done in many ways. Things constantly change in technology. Databricks added the autoloader feature so that engineers did not have to keep track of new vs. old files. The delta live tables (DLT) is a declarative framework that simplifies data ingestion and allows for quality constraints. Both techniques are based on streaming and will be covered in a future tip. The warehouse is a relatively new addition to the Databricks ecosystem. The public preview of the service was released in November 2020. Please see the release notes for details. The SQL Warehouse computing power is measured differently than the Spark Clusters. Please see the documentation for details. With data engineering, you must pick the number of nodes, virtual machine series/size, access mode, and Databricks runtime engine and make any additional Spark configurations. Typically, the computing cluster is spun up with an optional auto-terminate value, which saves the client money by not having the virtual machines running 24 x 7. This computing cluster can be used for interactive tasks or job workflow execution. Most importantly, the computing cluster is carved out of the clients' cloud account. The computing power for the warehouse is measurable and is considered serverless in nature. No virtual machines ever show up in the client's cloud account. These clusters are owned by Databricks Service, are in a warm state, and are used for SQL workloads only. Please see the image below for an extra small cluster size named "Starter Warehouse." The SQL Warehouse environment is built around the schema explorer, the ability to run queries, create reports, add reports to dashboards, and define alerts based on queries. At this point, we are going to rebuild the weather table using the SQL Warehouse and Spark SQL. The code below creates a database (schema) named mssqltips with a comment. Comments are invaluable when a data governance tool is used to harvest predefined tagging. The design pattern below is important to understand. It will be used two times to create tables for both the low temperature and high temperature data files. First, if a managed table exists, we want to delete it. Second, we want to create an empty Delta Table with no schema. Third, we want to use the COPY INTO statement with the correct options. The file format and format options define the source file. Since we want to use the inferred schema from the file, we need to set the copy option to allow merging of schemas. The above code loads the low temperature data, while the code below loads the high temperature data. The last step is to create a view to join the two tables. Please note that the Spark SQL language allows for comments at the table level, view level, and the column level. The image below summarizes the options the developer has with the SQL warehouse: edit new queries, view saved queries, create dashboards from visuals, create alerts based on queries, view query history, and manage warehouses. In short, we can see we have two tables in the hive meta store. A simple SELECT statement of the view we created with a limit of five records is shown below. To recap, many of the data engineering features that you can do with Python can be done with the SQL Warehouse. I will cover the details of this service in a future tip. There are many ways a data engineer can stream data into a data lake. This section with introduce the simplest use case where CSV files are stored in an Azure Storage Container. We will be using our S&P 500 stock data in this example. The source data files are in a CSV format and the data processing is called structured streaming. The first task is to understand how many source files we have in the raw zone. This can be done by calling the list files method of the file system class in the dbutils library. There are six stock data files from 2013. We always want to use a schema file when dealing with weak file formats. Please see the Spark reference for SQL data types. This comes in handy when crafting a schema string. The maximum number of files that can be processed per triggered stream is set to two files. This number was picked to show you that three triggered events are needed to process six files. There are many options with Spark streaming. Other options include processing all available files in the source folder now and running the streaming process as a continuous event. The check below should always return true. The chances that the incoming stream is correctly formatted are low. We want the date column to be a timestamp that we can use in our Spark SQL queries. Additionally, information such as load time, path to input file, and various parts of the path might be important to the end user. The following code uses the withColumn to create new fields for our dataframe. The writeStream method appends the two CSV files loaded by the readStream method to a delta file. The checkpoint file is very important. This keeps track of files that have been processed. Thus, files will not be re-processed if they are listed in the checkpoint file. To rebuild a delta table, it is best to delete the "streaming" directory, which includes both the delta files and the checkpoint files. The writeStream action will stop once the readStream data is consumed. We can check the status of the write process using the code below. The last step is to stop the stream. This is a very important step that is sometimes overlooked. It is always important to check the results of executing a notebook. We expect two files to be loaded for every triggered event. The query below executes an aggregation directly against the delta file. The expected results show groups of records having the same load date. This section is a brief introduction to streaming. Future articles will talk about autoloader and delta live tables. These two features have changed how big data programmers ingest data. However, both methods are built upon the core Spark streaming concepts. The Graphframe project was introduced to the Spark ecosystem in the summer of 2016. It allows designers to supply vertices and edges as dataframes to the API. Then, interesting social networking questions can be asked. The image below shows a typical network of friends. The image below shows the two Spark Dataframes that are input to the Graphframe. Methods on the Graphframe object can be used to retrieve results from the graph. For instance, how many people are older than 33 or how many people have two or more followers? Please see the detail behind this section's content in a Databricks Engineering Team blog post. There is a knowledge graph use case that has been done with both Airline Flights, Insurance Policies and Life Sciences. Here, we only scratched the surface of what can be done with graph models. There are many different algorithms to retrieve information stored in their structure. A future article will be needed to dive deeper into the subject. Machine learning (ML) can be used to solve various problems, such as classification, regression, text analysis, image recognition, recommendations, and clustering. Here is a great cheat sheet on when to apply which algorithm (technique). The goal of this section is to understand what a data scientist can achieve by using Databricks. The first step in any ML project is to retrieve, clean, and prepare features. Because the data lake can store a variety of files, this is a prime location for the data scientist to explore what is available. The second step is to create a model. Many different algorithms and/or feature selections might be tried until a solution that has an acceptable prediction rate is achieved. The data for creating an algorithm is grouped into two sets. The training data set is used to create the model. The testing data set has a known set of outcomes. We use this set to judge the accuracy of our model. Databricks released ML Flow as an open-source framework in June 2018. Please see the release notes for details. Three key problems are solved by ML Flow: tracking, projects, and models. See the Databricks initial blog on the framework. Why is tracking important? The creation of models is like a lab experiment. Under certain conditions, predictive accuracy is achieved. Both the data and model might change over time. If our ML model drifts over time, the framework is a great place to find out why. The registry allows us to redeploy saved models that might achieve better results. Finally, we need to deploy our model to production. There are many ways to use the model like point-in-time scoring using web services or batch scoring over stored rows in a database. The framework can help with those problems, too. There are many ways to get data into a data lake. Both Spark Dataframes and Spark SQL can be used to ingest and transform your existing files stored in cloud storage. Traditionally, a medallion architecture is used to enhance the data quality as files are moved between the zones. I will talk about advanced data engineering services such as autoloader and delta live tables in the future. To compete in the Data Warehouse computing sector, Databricks created the SQL Warehouse service. The main difference between data engineering and this service is how a cluster is deployed. With traditional clusters, all the nitty gritty details must be configured. The computing power is carved out of the owner's subscription. The SQL Warehouse is considered serverless and T-shirt sizes are used to pick a configuration. The COPY INTO statement is key to getting data from files into DELTA tables. There is only support for the SQL language since this is a Data Warehouse. Other features that you might be interested in such as schedules, reports, dashboards and alerts in will be covered in a future article. The lambda architecture is based upon two lanes. The slow (batch) lane can be handled by the initial data engineering techniques that I covered. The fast (speed) lane is handled by streaming. Today, we covered how structured streaming can process files stored in a storage container. The read and write stream are important methods to learn. There are a couple techniques on how to handle transformations within micro batches. These topics will be covered in a future article. My first introduction to directed graphs was the Traveling Salesperson problem. The key idea behind this problem is there are customers in N cities and directed traveling routes. Starting at the home office, how can you visit all the clients? This problem can be optimized for travel distance, time traveling, and/or total cost. Unfortunately, the Graphframe library cannot solve this problem. However, it can solve other problems such as querying properties of the vertices and edges. It can solve the shortest path problem from one vertex to the next. Please see the documentation for more details. Machine learning has evolved over the years. What I learnt five years ago for my EDX Data Science certificate is totally different than what is available today. Regardless of the libraries and algorithms you are using, the data scientist needs a framework to track projects and models. The key purpose of a data lake is to have all the data in one place so that the data scientist can start feature selection. The clean-up of the data into an ingestible format is the lion share of the work. The selection and tuning of the ML model takes time and iterations. That is why tracking is so important. Finally, the model can be released to production. The work does not stop there. Periodic checking of the accuracy will notify you if the model has drifted and changes are required. This whole process is sometimes referred to as Machine Learning Operations (ML Ops). In summary, today's tutorial is a high-level coverage of five different products that are part of the Databricks ecosystem. I hope you enjoyed the overview and look forward to going deeper into each topic in the future.

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

October 01, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Oct. 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against CrowdStrike on July 30, 2024 with a Class Period from November 29, 2023 to July 29, 2024. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of CrowdStrike have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint.

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Californiaâs Napa Valley wine industry is world-renowned, generating $50 billion annually in economic impact.1âEconomic impact,â Napa Valley Vintners, accessed September 20, 2024.The wines produced among the 700 wineries in the region rival those of any other region across the globe. The story of the Napa wine industry is a familiar one. Only a few decades ago, the region was a rural outpost with a small community of mostly independent vineyards. It boomed after investors and entrepreneurs worked together, put their product to the test, and won awards against the worldâs best in the 1970s. Napa is just one example of places and industries springing up from humble beginnings to become global successes. Dalton, Georgia, is considered a global carpet capital.2George Pendle, âDalton, GA: How a bedspread fiefdom became a carpet kingdom,â Atlas Obscura, July 7, 2015. Eighty-five percent of the carpets sold in the United States and 45 percent sold globally are made in the region. Similarly, High Point, North Carolina, is a global hub for furnitureâat one point the region was responsible for producing 60 percent of all furniture sold in the United States.3âFurniture history: High Point & furniture,â High Point Museum, accessed on September 25, 2024. Its biannual markets host exhibitors from around the world. Today, Napa wineries, Dalton carpet companies, and High Point furniture factories are a mix of big and small businesses, and in many cases still include family-run operations. They succeeded not only because of their product but also because of their ability to efficiently produce it at scale. The regionsâ success illustrates how, under the right conditions, micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) in any industry can expand their global reach. Productivity is a measure of how efficiently goods and services, or output, are produced, compared with the amount of inputs used.1âInvesting in productivity growth,â McKinsey Global Institute, March 27, 2024. In macroeconomic terms, it is defined as the value of the goods and services produced, divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required for its production. For this report, we focus on labor productivity, measured as value added per worker (in US dollars at purchasing-power parity). While the more accurate measure of labor productivity is value added per hour workedâas the number of weekly hours worked varies substantially among US states. For example, the average weekly hours worked by production employees on manufacturing payrolls in the United States varied from 27.7 hours in Alaska to 44.3 hours in Louisiana in 2023.2âState and metro area employment, hours, & earnings,â US Bureau of Labor Statistics, April 2023. We use the per-worker metric, as it is more commonly available across size categories and sectors. Due to the lack of comprehensive data at the individual company level for micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises, we rely on subsector-level average productivity to make inferences.3We focus on national- or sector-level productivity from a growth economics perspective. Organizational-productivity research often studies issues related to attrition, disengagement, skills mismatch, or time inefficiency. See, for example, Aaron De Smet, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, Angelika Reich, and Bill Schaninger, âSome employees are destroying value. Others are building it. Do you know the difference?,â McKinsey Quarterly, September 11, 2023. To get there, US MSMEs should look to ramping up productivity, a move that will be vital to American competitiveness in the coming years (see sidebar âMeasuring productivityâ). Small businesses can reach the next level of growth by taking advantage of new technology, including generative AI (gen AI), and partnering with bigger companies, and they will need the infrastructure and systems to support them. The McKinsey Global Institute aggregated a richly granular data set of MSMEs and large companies across 12 broad sectors, 68 level-two subsectors, and more than 200 level-three subsectors in 16 countries with different income levels, accounting for more than 50 percent of global GDP. In this group (listed by per capita GDP in 2021 in purchasing-power-parity terms) are ten advanced economies (the United States, Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Israel, Japan, Spain, Poland, and Portugal) and six emerging economies. MSMEs play a large role across the boardâin the advanced economies, they average 66 percent of employment and 54 percent of value added. The United States has an ample small business engine. MSMEs, defined as businesses employing up to 500 people, are a major foundation of economic activity, responsible for 58 percent of jobs and 39 percent of value added in the business economy (Exhibit 1). In some US business sectors, MSMEs have an outsize impact. They account for more than three-fourths of workers and value added in the construction sector, for example. And they account for more than half of all workers and value added in the professional services and accommodation and food sectors (Exhibit 2). MSMEs also help fuel the US economic engine. Companies that were MSMEs at some point since 2000 now represent 17 percent of publicly traded companies valued at $10 billion or more as of 2023 (Exhibit 3). Small technology companies have made the biggest breakthroughsânearly a quarter of large public tech companies were MSMEs in the past 25 years, Meta and Zoom Video Communications among them. Many of todayâs big manufacturing companies also started as small factories. Monster Beverage and Tesla are recent examples. Innovation has been a big factor in fast-scaling companies. Small companies in the tech sector have produced more patents per employee than their bigger competitors.4Robert D. Atkinson, The National Economic Council gets it wrong on the role of big and small firms in U.S. innovation, Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, July 20, 2023. The United States enjoys a status as a global leader in business, with 621 of the 2,000 largest global publicly traded companies, according to Forbes, and is home to a disproportionately high number of very large, highly productive companies or superstars.5Hank Tucker, âInside the Global 2000: United States grows more dominant among worldâs largest companies,â Forbes, June 13, 2024; âSuperstars: The dynamics of firms, sectors, and cities leading the global economy,â McKinsey Global Institute, October 24, 2018. However, when it comes to small business productivity on a global scale, US MSMEs are comparatively average. US small businesses, in purchasing-power-parity terms, are roughly on par with those in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Italy. Among the ten advanced economies we studied, small companies are, on average, 60 percent as productive as big businessesâbut US small companies are just 47 percent as productive (Exhibit 4). Small business productivity varies by sector. While, on average, US MSMEs are on par with those in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Italy, they lag in a few sectorsâmining, transportation and storage, and administrative services. Additionally, they trail in some technology subsectors such as computer programming and some manufacturing subsectors such as basic metals, machinery and equipment, and furniture. The productivity ratio relative to large companies also varies by sector. In the United States, it ranges from 35 percent in mining to 88 percent in the administrative-services sector (Exhibit 5). In other words, MSMEs in the mining sector face the widest gap in productivity relative to their large peers in the same sector, closely followed by information and communications technology (ICT) and manufacturing. On the other end, MSMEs in administrative services come closest to performing as productively as their large peers. In fact, in a few sectorsâadministrative services, professional services, transportation and storage, and retail and wholesale tradeâmedium-size businesses with 50 to 499 employees perform at the same level or even better than large companies (with more than 500 employees). But, apart from accommodation and food, microenterprises with ten employees or less and small enterprises with ten to 49 employees are less productive than medium-size enterprises, which are on average twice as productive. Overall, the gap widens as the company size gets smaller. The vast productivity gap can be partially explained by differences in the kind of work undertaken by small and large businesses. Small businesses play a crucial role in enabling the productivity of large companies, which tend to focus on core competencies and outsource less essential activities to other businesses, a phenomenon called work fissuring.6David Weil, âUnderstanding the present and future of work in the fissured workplace context,â Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences, 2019, Volume 5, Number 5. This results in greater concentration of higher-value-added activities in large companies, with smaller businesses taking on lower-value work. But ultimately, the productivity ratio depends on advantages of scale in areas such as technology, human capital, market access, and finance. MSMEs struggle to access these competencies at the same level as larger companies. For example, the share of MSMEs that adopt technologies such as customer relationship management systems and artificial intelligence is only half the share of large companies.7The OECD model survey on ICT usage by businesses: Second revision, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2015. Large companies are twice as likely to provide formal skilling programs and are more active in monitoring performance and awarding performance bonuses.8McKinsey Global Institute analysis of the World Bank Enterprise Survey, 2013â22. MSMEs derive just 5 percent of their total sales from direct exports, which is one-third of the sales made overseas by large enterprises. The share of large businesses using banks for working capital financing is 1.5 times that of small businesses. Consequently, the MSME productivity ratio tends to be lower and the productivity gap wider in sectors where these competencies play a significant role in driving business competitiveness. MSMEs are ubiquitous across all states, but their economic contribution is uneven. On one end are states such as Nevada and South Carolina, where small businesses employ around half the workers and represent about 35 percent of receipts in the business economy. On the other end, in states such as Montana and Vermont, about three-fourths of employment is in small businesses, generating about 55 percent of those statesâ receipts (see sidebar âHow small businesses fared during the COVID-19 pandemicâ). Among the top 40 metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) by employment, small businesses account for between 25 and 50 percent of receipts and between 50 and 70 percent of employment in the business sector (Exhibit 6). The number of new businesses registered each year in the United States increased dramatically during the pandemic. Over 2019 to 2021, the number of new businesses registered increased by 54 percent. However, while new businesses were registered, existing businesses closedâand their numbers appear to be in balance. The net number of micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) increased by only 6 percent between 2019 and 2021 (exhibit). On the other hand, despite the number of new business registrations growing only by 10 percent in the prepandemic period from 2017 to 2019, the net number of MSMEs grew by 4 percent, and their employment also increased by 3 percent. A relatively higher number of MSMEs appear to have survived during this period. Despite the significant increase in new business registrations during the pandemic, these businesses did not generate proportionate employment, with the net workforce in MSMEs falling in half the states over 2019 to 2021. On average, the number of MSME workers fell by 1 percent in the United States. The proportion of workers employed by MSMEs stayed stagnant for the most part. This suggests that the industry structure might be gradually changing, with some small businesses growing into large companies, or more employees moving from smaller to larger companies, transitioning to more productive work. Overall, this is the right direction of movement for the United States. This variation in the economic contribution of MSMEs across states and MSAs is also reflected in their performance, measured as receipts per worker as a proxy for productivity. Some of these differences could be attributable to differences in price levels across states. Clearly, states with higher prices might generate higher receipts per worker than states with lower prices, independent of any true differences in performance. So to compare the true performance of MSMEs across regions, we measured the receipts that MSMEs generate for every worker in each state and in the top 40 MSAs by employment, adjusted for regional price parity.9Micro-, small, and medium-size enterprise receipts per worker for each state and each metropolitan statistical area (MSA) are adjusted to account for the differences in price levels of goods and services, using regional price parities (RPPs) sourced from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. RPPs are calculated using expenditure data from the consumer price index, which is aggregated into broader expenditure categories and then allocated across regions using a multilateral aggregated method that expresses a regionâs price level relative to the United States. RPPs may not completely reflect the extent of price differentials within a state or MSA, particularly in areas with significant economic disparities. Across sectors, MSMEs are assumed to generate revenue locally within the state, while large companies are assumed to generate revenue globally, nationally, or regionally.10As a result, we adjust micro-, small, and medium-size enterprise (MSME) receipts per worker, depending on regional price parities in a state or metropolitan statistical area, but do not adjust large-company receipts. We adjust for all sectors equally. This approach has drawbacks in sectors such as mining, manufacturing, and information and communications technology, wherein a sizeable share of MSME revenue generation might be nonlocal. We estimate that this limitation could imply, approximately, a 15 percent variation around the mean. Similar limitations apply to large companies that might primarily generate receipts locally in certain sectors, such as a large restaurant chain only operating in a few states. MSME performance varies significantly across states (Exhibit 7) and MSAs (Exhibit 8). Their performance goes hand in hand with large-company performance. In general, where large companies perform better or poorer than the national average, so do MSMEs, and vice versa. MSME performance relative to large companies is concentrated within a narrow band. In more than 30 states with 70 percent of all MSME employees, small business receipts per worker are 45 to 55 percent that of large businesses. However, among the top 40 MSAs, there is a larger variation. The same relative performance band of 45 to 55 percent comprises only 15 MSAs, accounting for only 30 percent of employment. So why do MSMEs in some states and metros perform better than others? Reasons could include differences in the business environment and policies. Some states have tax, regulations, and compliance systems that support the expansion of large and small companies alike. Some states have more deeply ingrained business networks, greater availability of financing, and a concentration of talent, which provide a boost to MSMEs that struggle to access these competencies. Capturing the MSME productivity potential is vital for US competitiveness amid a changing world: geopolitical shifts, net-zero transitions and the rise of the green economy, and greater healthcare needs for an aging population, along with the developments in gen AI (see sidebar âHow generative AI can propel small businessesâ). There is already a tech adoption divide between large and small businesses. The share of micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) that adopt technologies such as customer relationship management systems and artificial intelligence is only half the share of large companies. However, there is scope for democratization of tech access with recent AI developmentsâmuch of the new software targeted at small businesses is expected to have AI, and even generative AI (gen AI), embedded in them. Such gen-AI-enabled products and services can be used with natural-language prompts, rather than advanced IT skills. This democratization makes AI more accessible to small businesses, but also raises the cost of nonadoption. It can potentially create a divide between small businesses that embrace technology and those that donât. For example, if previously the difference between a business that adopted technology and one that didnât was creating email marketing campaigns versus printing marketing flyers, now the difference will be the tech-friendly MSMEâs ability to launch substantial digital marketing campaigns with a simple prompt, with the ability to analyze the effectiveness of the campaigns and tweak them easily. The productivity lift for such a company could be considerable. The effective use of data will rise in importanceâand small businesses can struggle with this, from both a scale and sophistication point of view. Small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) often have a wealth of data, and gen AI tools can help them leverage that data to grow their business. So how can small businesses implement these technologies effectively? Here are several trends to consider: Although conditions vary across states and MSAs, the low productivity levels of small businesses are holding back US competitiveness. Narrowing the MSME productivity gap is equivalent to 5.4 percent of GDPÂ (Exhibit 9).11âA microscope on small businesses: Spotting opportunities to boost productivity,â McKinsey Global Institute, May 2, 2024. The tremendous variation in MSME productivity ratios across countries suggests there is ample room for improvement in many sectors in the United States. While meaningful benchmarks vary based on local conditions, we compare the average productivity ratio of MSMEs to that of large US companies with a top quartile ratio across the ten advanced economies we studied at a subsector level. Retail and wholesale trade, manufacturing, construction, and ICT account for the bulk of the productivity opportunity by virtue of their large share of national output and employment. The largest opportunity is in wholesale and automotive tradeâwhich is almost 35 percent. In these sectors, MSMEs in the United States are only 38 percent as productive as large companies, a figure that is low relative to other advanced economies. For example, MSMEs in the automotive-trade sector in Japan are 62 percent as productive as large companies. They are more vertically integrated with large manufacturers, enabling efficient logistics that follow just-in-time principles and respond effectively to market fluctuations.12Christina L. Ahmadjian and Joanne E. Oxley, âVertical relationships, hostages, and supplier performance: Evidence from the Japanese automotive industry,â Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, 2013, Volume 29, Number 3.Â Similarly, wholesale trade MSMEs in Germany are 83 percent as productive as large companies. They benefit from market-leading innovation and vertical integration with upstream purchasers, such as retail supermarkets or distributors for large manufacturers, across the entire European Union.13Bernhard Dachs et al., EU wholesale trade: Analysis of the sector and value chains, The Vienna Institute for International Economics Studies research report, number 415, June 2016; Matthias Fauth, Benjamin Jung, and Wilhelm Kohler, âGerman firms in international trade: Evidence from recent microdata,â Journal of Economics and Statistics, 2023, Volume 243, Number 3â4. US businesses can take inspiration from these countries to improve their productivity. Moreover, US manufacturing supply chains are realigningÂ across the electronics, automotive, and pharma sectors, for example. The CHIPS and Science Act offers new spending and opportunity for MSMEs tied to semiconductor manufacturing and R&D.14âFact sheet: CHIPS and Science Act will lower costs, create jobs, strengthen supply chains, and counter China,â The White House, August 9, 2022. In the electronics industry, MSMEs generate 22 percent of value added, accounting for 2 percent of the productivity opportunity. The automotive industry accounts for another 2 percent, which may improve the competitiveness of the American electric-vehicle industry. Additionally, the recent surge in biotech investments is another opportunity for MSMEs. They generate 18 percent of value added in the pharmaceuticals, life sciences, and biotechnology sectors, and their productivity opportunity accounts for 2 percent of the total. A competitive manufacturing economy requires efficient logistics, but in the United States, transportation companies are less efficient than their advanced-economy counterparts. MSMEs in the transportation sector account for 6 percent of the productivity opportunity. As the United States works to rebuild its public infrastructure and improve its supply of housing stock, as well as undertake capital expenditures in building renewable energy infrastructure, there will be an increased demand for construction services, a sector particularly dominated by MSMEs, with significant room for productivity improvement. Twelve percent of the productivity opportunity can come from small businesses involved in construction. The productivity imperative is even more important in the context of labor force shortages in the construction sector.15âHelp wanted: Charting the challenge of tight labor markets in advanced economies,â McKinsey Global Institute, June 26, 2024. Labor market tightness in the United States is among the highest across advanced economiesâmaking it challenging for the US economy to grow through employment alone. Almost three-fifths of job openings in March 2024 wereÂ in states with lower-than-average performance of MSMEs relative to large companies (Exhibit 10). Boosting MSME productivity could enable states to close that labor gap by offering workers higher pay and nonpay benefits, or by reducing hiring needs because they produce the same output with fewer workers. Either way, the small business gains. For small businesses, the road to higher productivity involves accessing four key competencies: technology, human capital, market access, and finance. MSMEs struggle to access these competencies at the same level as larger companies, explaining wider productivity gaps in sectors where they are vital for competitiveness. How can small businesses better develop these competencies? An answer lies in what may seem, at first, an unlikely source: networks and interactions with other, usually bigger, businesses. Business-to-business interactions fuel MSME productivity and help them narrow the productivity gap (Exhibit 11). Businesses large and small should reconsider whether they have an adversarial approach to one another. Policies that attempt to create incentives, quotas, or protections that tilt the balance toward either small enterprises or larger ones arenât necessarily the solution. The truthâbroadlyâis that both MSMEs and large companies can benefit when they are operating within the right economic conditions. Large companies could help smaller companies acquire competenciesâbut itâs not a one-way street. Small companies help large companies as customers, suppliers, and sources of new ideas. In fact, the productivity of large and small companies tends to move hand in hand in most sectors. Boosting interactions between them could raise overall productivity for everyone. Our analysis of a wide cross-section of subsectors across emerging and advanced economies suggests that MSME and large-company productivity move in tandem in most subsectors, indicating spillovers if the right conditions are established. In the United States and in other advanced economies, there are multiple examples of winâwin relationships between MSMEs and large businessesâtemplates for what has already worked. There are four kinds of models: larger companies innovating products and services targeted at helping small companies raise performance, intentional collaborative partnerships between small and large companies, more organically formed regional business clusters, and sector-wide infrastructure designed to boost intercompany connections. Serving small-business customers with offerings that boost productivity. MSMEs could interact with larger businesses as their customers. They could benefit from improving their overall efficiency and ability to invest in more technology and capabilities. Large companies can sell MSMEs productivity-boosting products and services and drive revenue growth. In short, small businesses could gain assets previously unavailable to them, and big companies could grow by selling those assets. Many small businesses have integrated with software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers to automate back-end operations and build capabilities in areas like compliance, tax, and accounting, thereby eliminating the need for people to perform these tasks. For example, a large HR solutions provider created a chat-based app specifically for small businesses to handle payroll. Another provider supports small businesses in hiring and onboarding. Other such collaborations help small businesses outsource managerial tasks, saving time for the owners at a fraction of the cost of a full-time employee, including tools for writing business plans, cloud-based project management tools, calendar tools for tracking time and building itineraries, and virtual assistants that record conversations, transcribe interviews, and generate summaries. MSMEs have also collaborated with other companies to expand their market reach, by utilizing products that enable them to accept digital payments, create content for marketing, and run an effective ad campaign. MSMEs are also integrating with providers to manage their finances in real time, seamlessly connecting with banks, accountants, and other business applications. And larger companies are using these digital footprints, such as merchant point-of-sale transactions, to enhance small business credit scores, helping businesses that might not otherwise qualify for financing. Collaborative partnerships fostered through supply chains. Collaborations between large and small companies can generate mutual benefits. Partnerships help larger businesses by giving them added resilience and flexibilityâthey also help MSMEs by building know-how, human capital, and market access. For example, in advanced-manufacturing industries, which require inputs from multiple suppliers such as semiconductors, automotive, and wind turbines, close collaboration between large integrators and suppliers helps suppliers reach new markets. Some contractual partnerships between Toyota and its suppliers have lasted for more than 30 years. Toyota has directly involved itself in raising the operational standards of its partners through knowledge transfer, from demand planning and cost reduction to raising management capabilities.16StÃ©phane Heim, âCapability building and functions of SMEs in business groups: A case study of Toyotaâs supply chain,â International Journal of Automotive Technology and Management, 2013, Volume 13, Number 4. IBM, in collaboration with other Fortune 500 companies, launched the Supplier Connection initiative that connects small suppliers to one another and to large businesses to access new opportunities.17Freddie Pierce, âIBM launches new Supplier Connection portal,â Supply Chain Digital, May 17, 2020. One study of small businesses in New York found that seven in ten of them increased their revenue within two years of becoming part of a corporate supplier base.18Giving small firms the business, Center for an Urban Future, March 2011. Sharing technology is a big part of the benefit. In the consumer-packaged-goods industry, large companies have improved the efficiency of fragmented suppliers by providing advanced digital and analytics tools that smaller companies do not have. The Global Lighthouse Networkâa World Economic Forum initiative in collaboration with McKinseyâhas identified multiple companies that have achieved productivity improvements of up to 250 percent in some factories.19Global Lighthouse Network: Adopting AI at speed and scale, World Economic Forum, December 2023. Some companies have focused on lifting the capabilities of the small business workforce through training programs that help them succeed as suppliers. One exampleÂ is Appleâs $50 million fund to provide learning and skills development opportunities for the employees of its suppliers, launched in collaboration with the International Labour Organization and the International Organization for Migration.20âApple launches $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund,â Apple press release, March 30, 2022. Another is NestlÃ©âs Nescafe Plan, which has provided training to small coffee farmers on techniques to increase crop yields.21Mark Segal, âNestle commits over $1 billion to sustainable coffee farming plan,â ESG Today, October 4, 2022. Finally, small companies can gain financial access by working with bigger companies. Some large companies use their relationships with financial institutions to advocate for small suppliers who may otherwise be unable to access credit or who may receive unfavorable rates. In Colombia, DuPont used its relationship with a financial institution to secure working capital credit for its MSME suppliers in rural areas. This, in turn, strengthened their supply chain and stabilized procurement.22Partnerships for small enterprise development, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, 2009. Vibrant, organically formed business clusters of large and small companies. In some industries and areas, such as Silicon Valley or the furniture industry in Grand Rapids, Michigan, small and large companies have formed regional networks of people, ideas, and financing. Small companies gain from concentrations of capital and talent drawn to the area by universities and large companies. Large companies gain from the innovation and entrepreneurialism of smaller ones (for example, through acquisitions). In Sacramento, a different kind of cluster has developed. Like Silicon Valley, the Sacramento cluster boosts the areaâs natural advantages by connecting large businesses, start-ups, academic research, and private capital. But the Sacramento agtech cluster replaces silicon chips for wine grapes, synthetic proteins, and irrigation systems.23âIndustries: Agri-food techâ Greater Sacramento Economic Council, accessed on September 20, 2024. People add capabilities, too. Drawn by the University of California (UC), Davis, which has a strong agricultural science department, large companies conduct biotech research in the area; the concentration of research labs, educated labor force, and expertise gives small start-ups an advantage over similar-size competitors. One example is Scout, a vineyard management start-up founded by a tech executive and a professor at UC Davis.24Vince Vitale, âNapa-based AI for vineyards closes $3 million in funding,â Press Democrat, April 9, 2024. The Sacramento cluster also provides infrastructure and financial access to MSMEs. Foodtech and agtech start-ups have access to wet labs, lab space, and manufacturing spaces that are set aside specifically for agtech start-ups. AgStart, a nonprofit, provides lab equipment, a commercial-grade kitchen, and event centers and has incubated more than 20 start-ups. mall businesses have gained access to capital, either through acquisition by another company, venture capital involvement, or public sector grants earmarked for developing the area. Sector-wide infrastructure designed to boost intercompany connections. Collaboration among companies could be encouraged by enhancing digital data and financial infrastructure, establishing a training ecosystem and creating a level playing fieldâin turn, fueling productivity for small businesses. An open data framework, for instance, could enable financial institutions to use nontraditional data sources for credit underwriting, targeted at a range of underfinanced companies, including MSMEs. An Experian study showed that including utility data allowed 20 percent of âthin fileâ credit customersâthose with scant documentation to support their credit applicationsâto become âthick fileâ customers who have higher loan approval rates.25Let there be light: The impact of positive energy-utility reporting on consumers, Experian, November 24, 2014. A focus on boosting technical competence can enable growth among all companies, small and large. For example, while national labs are mandated to share research with companies, small companies seldom utilize these resources. Improving marketing efforts and providing incentives could encourage greater participation. Policy makers can play a role in promoting technology adoption. An example of this is Singaporeâs GoBusiness initiative, which provides financial support for all businesses that adopt technology solutions to improve their business processes, in line with industry road maps. Establishing a training ecosystem can help MSMEs access crucial technical and strategic expertise. Examples include the United Statesâ Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), which provides small businesses with access to a national network of hundreds of specialists, who offer services ranging from supply chain management to industrial design, technology-driven market intelligence, marketing and sales, and more. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which administers MEP, estimated that the program interacted with more than 36,000 small manufacturers in 2023, helping to create or retain more than 100,000 jobs.26âMEP economic impacts boost business and jobs,â National Institute of Standards and Technology, April 1, 2024.Â For every dollar of federal investment, it also generated nearly $25 in new sales growth and $28 in new client investment, with a cumulative cost savings of nearly $3 billion.27âManufacturing Extension Partnership: About NIST MEP,â National Institute of Standards and Technology, updated February 9, 2024. Greater collaborations among MSMEs can also raise productivity through knowledge sharing, mentoring, networking, and collectively benefiting from investments. Business leaders and policy makers can join forces to create a pathway to greater MSME productivity. Small businesses can start the process by working with one another. There are three main considerations that could shape stakeholder actions: create a winâwin economic fabric, adopt a granular and tailored approach, and foster networks and connections. In many ways, what spurred the Napa wine industry to world-class status can happen across industries and regions in the United States. Just as Napa vintners shared resources and, in some cases, partnered with bigger wineries, industries as disparate as retail and construction can also use the tools afforded by existing, bigger players in their sectors. Pushing productivity among MSMEs is essential as the United States seeks to remain a global economic powerhouse. Indeed, many of todayâs great American companies have humble beginnings. Nurturing a new crop of small American businesses will keep the US economy vibrant, its workforce growing, and its status strong for seasons to come.

WATCH LIVE The job cuts at the company add to the 5,000 or so layoffs last year. LONDON -- CVS is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the company said Tuesday. "We've embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work," a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health's (CVS) workforce. "Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers," the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. "Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations," the spokesperson said Tuesday. US drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General's growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, "to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents," according to its latest annual report.

Innovation can’t exist without foundational infrastructure networks to support it. Last week, PYMNTS reported that the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership, which is spearheaded by Microsoft, BlackRock and others, is planning to spend up to $100 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, ensuring that the plumbing is in place for the connected economy’s future. After all, the digital infrastructure being built right now isn’t just for the tech elite — it’s the foundation for how the world will do business. But data centers alone won’t enable the future of global connectivity. Internet access requires the internet, which is traditionally delivered around the world via undersea cables. Today, a network of these active undersea cables spans the oceans in a literal internet services value chain, connecting continents and facilitating the high-speed transfer of data essential for everything from video streaming to cloud computing to financial transactions. Traditionally, telecom companies and consortiums of government-backed entities have built and maintained undersea cables. But this has shifted as Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon expand their role in infrastructure. Google is a part or sole owner of around 33 subsea cables, Meta owns more than a dozen, Microsoft counts five and Amazon four. In the past 10 years alone, the amount of international cable capacity used by just that same quartet of tech giants has surged from 10% to 71%, according to a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. As businesses and consumers demand faster, more reliable connections to conduct transactions, Big Tech’s investments in these undersea cables are becoming essential for everything from online banking to cross-border trade. These cables are about more than just data transfer and cloud capacity. They’re the unseen threads stitching together the fabric of a connected economy. Read more: How 10 Payments Executives ‘Do’ Digital in the Post-Pandemic Age The global economy relies on digital infrastructure to support commerce and payments. As consumer habits shift toward digital transactions and as businesses expand into international markets, the importance of robust, secure data infrastructure becomes paramount. Global payments, for example, are facilitated by real-time data transfers that cross national borders instantaneously, supported by undersea cables. More than $150 trillion in cross-border payments are made every year, and the volume is expected to grow as digital commerce continues to expand. Payment networks require low latency to ensure that these transfers happen quickly and securely, especially as transactions are increasingly verified through real-time risk assessments powered by AI and other data-intensive tools. The quicker and more reliably data can be transferred, the smoother and more secure the world of commerce becomes. For example, as more businesses migrate their operations to the cloud, they can benefit immensely from fast, uninterrupted data connections across the globe. And as the world moves toward more digital and real-time payment solutions, the underlying infrastructure becomes even more critical. Technologies like blockchain, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and instant payment platforms depend on low-latency, high-capacity networks. These innovations have the potential to transform cross-border commerce by reducing friction, lowering fees and speeding up settlement times. Read more: Meta Says It’s Solving AR Experiences — Who Will Solve AR Payments? Yet, all of these improvements rely on a physical layer of infrastructure — particularly undersea cables — that can support the demands of these payment systems. At the same time, as global trade and eCommerce expand, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, the need for fast, secure connectivity grows exponentially. Big Tech’s investment in undersea cables in these regions opens up new avenues for expanding digital economies, enabling even remote regions to participate in global commerce seamlessly. Data from PYMNTS Intelligence finds that consumers in the U.S. alone engage in an average of 14 different digital activities each month: paying bills online, conducting telehealth visits, streaming music and videos, and shopping and paying for groceries and retail products using digital payments and apps. PYMNTS’ Karen Webster covered last month (Sept. 3) how, as digital becomes the DNA of business, success won’t be measured by the products a business makes or sells, but how well they create and monetize ecosystems that connect activities across traditional industry sectors. “As I have written many times, payments is the cornerstone for this digital transformation,” she wrote.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Chief Operating Officer Javier Olivan has sold a portion of his company stock, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The transaction, which took place on September 27, 2024, involved the sale of 413 shares of Class A Common Stock at a price of $570.00 per share, totaling approximately $235,410. The sale was conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which was adopted by Olivan on August 30, 2023. This type of plan allows corporate insiders to set up a predetermined schedule for buying and selling stock at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information, providing an affirmative defense against allegations of insider trading. Following the sale, the COO still holds a significant number of shares in the company. Directly, Olivan owns 12,359 shares of Meta Platforms. Additionally, indirect holdings through various entities bring his total stake in the company to a substantial amount. Specifically, Olivan D LLC holds 8,622 shares, Olivan Reinhold D LLC holds 2,999 shares, Reinhold D LLC holds another 8,622 shares, and the Olivan Reinhold Family Revocable Trust, of which Olivan and his spouse are Co-Trustees, holds 75,044 shares. The disclosed indirect holdings illustrate the various ways in which corporate executives can own stock, including through family trusts and limited liability companies. These disclosures provide transparency to investors and the market, offering insights into the financial interests that executives have in the companies they manage. Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc ., is a leader in social media and technology, offering a range of services in computer programming and data processing. The company's stock is watched closely by investors who are interested in the tech sector's performance and leadership trends. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). has experienced a series of significant developments. Pivotal Research has given Meta a Buy rating, setting a new price target of $780. The firm has highlighted Meta's potential for robust revenue growth and cost efficiencies, particularly those gained through artificial intelligence and a significant reduction in Reality Labs' losses. Similarly, Monness, Crespi, Hardt maintained a Buy rating on Meta, raising the stock's 12-month price target to $620, citing the company's AI and metaverse potential. On the regulatory front, Meta was fined €91 million by Ireland's Data Protection Commission for a security lapse involving user password storage. This fine contributes to Meta's total penalties of €2.5 billion under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. Oppenheimer has also maintained its Outperform rating on Meta, following the company's annual "Meta Connect" developer event, which showcased technological advances, including a lower-cost mixed-reality headset and updates to its AI capabilities. Lastly, the company has been positively influenced by Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)'s forecast of higher-than-expected first-quarter revenue, sparking renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI) chips. These are the recent developments involving Meta Platforms Inc. Meta Platforms' stock performance and financial metrics provide additional context to COO Javier Olivan's recent stock sale. According to InvestingPro data, Meta's stock is trading near its 52-week high, with a price that is 98.87% of its highest point over the past year. This strong performance is reflected in the company's impressive 92.6% price total return over the last year. The company's financial health appears robust, with InvestingPro Tips highlighting that Meta holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet and has liquid assets exceeding short-term obligations. This strong financial position may provide reassurance to investors regarding the company's stability, despite the insider sale. Meta's valuation metrics present an interesting picture. While the stock is trading at a high Price / Book multiple of 9.24, it also has a relatively low P/E ratio of 28.7 compared to its near-term earnings growth. This suggests that while the stock may appear expensive by some measures, it could still be undervalued relative to its growth prospects. The company's profitability is noteworthy, with impressive gross profit margins of 81.49% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip highlighting Meta's "impressive gross profit margins."

Title: Microsoft Discontinuing Mixed Reality HoloLens 2 Headset

Microsoft is planning to discontinue its mixed reality HoloLens 2 headsets, according to a report from UploadVR. Production on the HoloLens 2 is ending, and sales will cease when stock runs out. Security updates will be provided until December 31, 2027, but after that point, Microsoft plans to end software support for the HoloLens 2. Microsoft was one of the first companies to delve into mixed reality technology, and it introduced the original HoloLens in 2016, following up with the HoloLens 2 in 2019. The HoloLens headsets have always been expensive and Microsoft has targeted them to enterprise customers rather than the general public. At the current time, Microsoft does not appear to have plans for another HoloLens headset. There were rumors of a version three back in 2022, but work was reportedly canceled due to a lack of focus and internal hardware development challenges. Microsoft has also been downsizing its mixed reality team in 2023 and 2024. Microsoft does apparently plan to continue supporting its HoloLens IVAS, which stands for integrated visual augmentation system. It is an AR headset that Microsoft is creating for the U.S. Army, and it is set to be tested in early 2025 to determine its feasibility for full-scale production. As Microsoft has been winding down its work on the HoloLens, it has partnered with Meta to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming and its Office apps to the Quest headsets, and it is also working on Windows 11 integration with the Quest. Apple's Vision Pro headset has been marketed to both consumers and enterprise customers unlike the HoloLens, but it currently shares some of the same shortcomings, such as a high price tag. Apple is not yet ready to abandon mixed reality, and there is another version of the Vision Pro in the works. A second AR/VR headset could come as soon as 2025.

Title: Man Baffled When He Shows Up for Job Interview and the Interviewer Is an AI Avatar

Time Published: 2024-10-01T21:53:14Z
Full Content:
When being evaluated for a job, employment seeker and marketer Jack Ryan found himself being interviewed by an artificial intelligence-powered avatar — and was not exactly thrilled with the experience. Ryan told 404 Media that the avatar he interviewed with, which was developed by a Melbourne-based AI startup called Fairgo, was "a perfect demonstration of late-stage capitalism." "While Fairgo's intent is to provide a fair and equitable interview process," Ryan said, "I can't imagine AI, [large language models], and other tools are able to interpret the human emotion and facial reactions to provide an actual, well-rounded interview." In a clip posted to his LinkedIn last week, the Silicon Valley-based marketer and self-described disabled athlete was seen smirking as the red-haired female avatar asked him for his work experience and encouraged him to get creative. "I find it helps when candidates tell me a story in answering the questions," the avatar, which does not appear to have a name, said robotically. It's a perfect encapsulation of the kind of uncanniness many said the age of AI would usher in — except, of course, far more banal. On its website, the startup claims that candidates interviewed by Fairgo avatars "consistently love the interview experience" — but Ryan very much disagrees. "As a disabled individual who is reliant on remote work, I am already concerned about openly stating I am disabled in the forms that companies put at the end of their job applications," he explained to 404. "To add an AI component into this mix, I imagine, would have the opposite effect of [diversity, equity, and inclusion]." Fairgo's CEO Julian Bright insisted in his own interview with 404 that his company's AI is actually there to help reduce human bias. Furthermore, Bright maintained that Fairgo's AI is not at all involved in the candidate selection process and that it does not use any video or audio taken during the process to evaluate candidates. All the same, being interviewed by an AI avatar seems to have left a bad taste in Ryan's mouth. "As someone who has interviewed upwards of 50 candidates for prior roles, human connection and interaction is the single most important indicator of how a team will mesh and jive together," he said. "If an AI is running the early stage process, it eliminates potential candidates because of its algorithmic design." At the end of the day, using a service like Fairgo's "shows how executives and corporations are further trying to cut costs on the human side of business," Ryan said. "As someone who has seen these layoffs at numerous top tech companies that then go on to rehire 6-12-18 months later... it's laughable at best and terrifying at worst," he concluded. We can't say we didn't smirk along with Ryan — but that's only to keep ourselves from crying.

Title: BREAKING: First XRP ETF Filed By Crypto Asset Manager Bitwise In Delaware

Time Published: 2024-10-01T21:18:46Z
Full Content:
As Ripple approaches a resolution in its ongoing legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), crypto asset manager Bitwise Invest has taken a significant step by filing the first application for an spot XRP ETF in Delaware. This filing, reported by Fox journalist Eleanor Terret, was officially submitted on September 30, and sources within Bitwise have confirmed the authenticity of this development. The approval of this ETF could have considerable implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. The filing comes at a pivotal moment for Ripple, as the company is awaiting the SEC’s decision on whether to appeal a recent court ruling that could potentially pave the way for greater regulatory clarity around XRP. Should the SEC choose not to appeal, it may bolster the case for XRP as a viable investment option, making the timing of Bitwise’s application particularly strategic. However, the path to approval is not straightforward. Like previous applications for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs—which were approved in January and July of this year, respectively—Bitwise’s filing will need to undergo rigorous scrutiny and meet various regulatory requirements set forth by the SEC. The agency’s review process can be lengthy, and approval may not come until next year. The filing of an XRP ETF could also signal a shift in the regulatory landscape, potentially opening the door for other financial institutions, such as BlackRock, to pursue similar applications. Moreover, this development may create a ripple effect for other cryptocurrencies seeking to enter the ETF space. Speculation is already growing around the possibility of a Solana ETF, which could be the next asset to attract interest from investors. It remains to be seen what other information can be revealed in the coming days by the asset manager, but the first filling of the first US spot XRP ETF is official. At the time of writing, the XRP price has shown no change from the broader market, posting losses of 3% in the 24-hour time frame, resulting in a current trading price of $0.6028. However, a potential XRP ETF market could have a notable price impact as more institutions could flock to invest in the token.

It was déja vu on Wall Street Tuesday as stocks slumped at the start of a new month for the third consecutive time, as market participants assessed the escalation of conflict in the Middle East and the possible fallout of U.S. port strikes. The S&P 500, which closed at a record high on Monday to wrap up a strong third quarter, fell 0.9% on Tuesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended 1.5% lower. Markets were rattled on Tuesday by a massive U.S. dockworker strike that threatens to throw a wrench in domestic supply chains and disrupt economic activity. Dockworkers at East Coast and Gulf Coast ports handling more than 68% of U.S. imports walked off the job Tuesday morning after the expiration of their contract with an industry group representing global shipping companies. Stocks got another shock Tuesday afternoon when Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel, which came soon after Israel launched an incursion in Lebanon and following the killing last week of a Hezbollah leader. The escalations by Israel and Iran sent oil prices soaring more than 5% amid concerns that a deeper conflict could stem the flow of crude out of the Middle East, a major global supplier. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) popped amid the tumult, jumping as much as 24%. Investors flocked to traditional safe havens like gold, which was up nearly 1% Tuesday afternoon, and Treasurys. Tuesday’s volatility resembled both September's and August's in certain ways. Early August’s selloff was sparked by worrisome jobs data and shifting global interest rates. Treasury yields and stocks declined this morning as markets digested data showing a continued hiring slowdown. September’s early rout was led by tech stocks after chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) posted good but not perfect earnings, leading some investors to pull back from richly valued tech stocks. Tech led markets lower on Tuesday, with Nvidia off nearly 4%, and Apple (AAPL) and the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) each down about 3%. Investors will be hoping Tuesday's slump is as short-lived as the last two. Stocks rebounded throughout both August and September to finish out each month at or near record highs.

Dockworkers strike at the entrance to a container terminal at the Port of Baltimore, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) Americans are on strike. Nearly 100,000 workers across the United States are walking off the job over contract negotiations with their employers, ranging from dockworkers to Boeing employees. The latest to join the picket line as of midnight on Tuesday are 45,0000 dockworkers from Maine to Texas. The union representing East and Gulf Coast dockworkers failed to reach a deal with ocean carriers and port operators represented by the U.S. Maritime Alliance. Specifically, the union wants stricter protections for its workers who they say are vulnerable to being replaced by automation and demanding a 77% wage increase over the next six years. And that doesn’t include 33,000 Boeing workers, primarily in its manufacturing sector, who are still on strike after they rejected the company’s “best and final offer” for a contract. The company has since implemented a hiring freeze, paused taking on new plane and part orders (with some exceptions) and furloughing white collar and desk-based employees. The two labor actions stem from similar complaints: wage increases, and protections for workers who could be replaced by automation or AI. Indeed, such talent (and retention) concerns are among the top concerns for manufacturers. About 50% of the top challenges faced by manufacturing companies are talent- and people-related, according to a survey by ABI research. But it’s not just an issue in the manufacturing industry. Last year, unions representing screenwriters and actors (SAG and WGA) also held strikes that paused Hollywood production over AI protections for artists.

Shot of a group of businesspeople having a meeting in a modern office A new report by Owl Labs shows that American employees are increasingly prioritizing “green-flag” bosses in their careers. Some, more so than healthcare benefits. Have you ever quit a job because of a bad boss? What about staying at a bad job because of a good boss? Managers have so much to do with our experience at work. From providing support in your current role to creating paths for career development, they are your main point of contact with company leadership. So employees (and job seekers) are taking a closer look at who their manager is, and how the boss can help be advocates for them. “A lot of it has to do with putting trust into someone else for their career,” says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs, “especially as a hybrid or remote worker.” Indeed, the potential for things to go south with a bad manager can be so daunting that Americans are prioritizing a good boss with “green flags”—things like support, advocacy and helpful feedback. According to Owl Labs, 92% of employees said that a supportive manager is the most important factor to their work, second only to compensation. This is up from last year, when 85% of surveyed employees said it was important to their work, behind compensation as well. “Generations now are really thinking about interviewing their boss [during the job process],” adds Weishaupt, “because if they’re going to be represented by this person within the company, they want to make sure they trust them.” News from the world of work Dell joined tech giant Amazon in ordering employees back to the office full-time on Thursday, though the order only applies to salespeople for now, according to Bloomberg.

Microsoft had around 228,000 full-time employees as of June, while Meta’s headcount totaled at more than 70,000 during the same time period. Microsoft has bet big on A.I. through multibillion-dollar partnerships with the likes of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and is ramping up to spend even more on the new technology in the future. Its capital expenditures for the April-June quarter, which totaled at $19 billion and marked a 78 percent increase year-over-year, primarily went towards A.I. and cloud-related projects. Meta, which recently released its newest A.I. model Llama 3.2, has also widely adopted the new technology through features like an A.I. assistant that integrated across its platforms and into products like its smart glasses and VR headsets. Other additions on the list, however, are less expected. Coming in at number four was the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which has 417 A.I.-related job postings and has begun incorporating the technology in recent years. The federal agency began using A.I.-powered fraud-detection tools in 2022 and was able to recover a total of $375 million in fraudulent payments in the fiscal year 2023 alone. The department, which has more than 100,000 employees currently, is additionally piloting or using A.I. in a variety of other cases that range from virtual assistant chatbots that can point taxpayers to the correct public websites to a model that could predict how long it will take items to be delivered to target facilities. Trailing behind the Treasury Department is Huntington Ingalls Industries, a defense contractor and military shipbuilding company currently hiring for 363 A.I.-related positions. The company expects its Mission Technologies division, which applies A.I. to build next generation smart defense and intelligence systems, to eventually produce more revenue than its long-dominant shipbuilding sector, CEO Chris Kastner told Defense One last year. Consulting companies, too, have embraced A.I. in rapid fashion. Deloitte, which ranked third on Getac's study with 461 listings, has partnered up with the likes of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon Web Services to help clients and enterprises use generative A.I. Accenture, which came in at number seven with 293 open A.I. jobs, last year pledged to invest more than $3 billion into its data and A.I. practice. Another major investor in the technology is the Georgia Institute of Technology—the only educational institution to make Getac's list with 338 A.I.-related job listings available. In addition to offering graduate programs in both A.I. and machine learning, the school earlier this year collaborated with Nvidia to launch the first A.I. supercomputer designed for student use. "By attracting and developing the best minds in A.I., we can ensure that Georgia Tech not only stays at the forefront of technological advancement, but also aligns its A.I. initiatives with the Institute’s core values of ethics, equity, and transparency," Skye Duckett, the university's vice president and chief human resources officer, told Observer in a statement. In the health field, the Mount Sinai Health System is the dominant player when it comes to applying A.I. with 355 roles open related to the new technology. In addition to using A.I. to detect breast cancer and interpret medical imaging data, Mount Sinai has created several in-house algorithms, "including predictive models to identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration," said the hospital network in a statement to Observer. Besides utilizing A.I. for health care needs, Mount Sinai also expects the technology to revolutionize its software. "Just about every piece" of Mount Sinai software will incorporate A.I. over the next three to five years, said Bruce Darrow, the hospital network's interim chief digital and information officer, in a recent interview with Healthcare IT News. "It's just the way that technology is going," said Darrow, noting that the technology will be helpful across electronic health record systems, emails, presentation documents and video collaborations.

Title: Coinbase exec hopes for better crypto regulations after the election

With less than 35 days until the U.S. presidential election, the crypto industry seems to be hoping for more favorable regulations in the near future. At Messari’s annual Mainnet conference in New York City, Shan Aggarwal, the vice president of corporate and business development at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) Ventures, touched on the industry’s regulatory uncertainties. “We’re hoping for the best,” he said in an exclusive interview with Quartz. His remarks highlight the sector’s anticipation that the coming election could lead to clearer, more supportive legislation. “The current SEC, it’s hard to go down from here,” Aggarwal said. “[Gary Gensler] has taken a regulation-by-enforcement approach towards the entire crypto industry, including Coinbase.” Aggarwal is scheduled to speak at the conference Wednesday, where he will discuss Coinbase’s investments, mergers, and acquisitions over the years, as well as its future strategic direction. This year, Coinbase partnered with traditional financial giants such as BlackRock to offer a platform for the tokenization of funds. Of that collaboration, Aggarwal said, “Coinbase acts as the bridge between traditional finance and crypto that touches different customer segments including retail customers, institutions, businesses.” Messari is a leading provider of market intelligence for the crypto and Web3 sectors. Its three-day conference brings together prominent crypto leaders, investors, and industry professionals to explore the rising trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) and integrating traditional financial instruments on blockchain — a signal of decentralized technologies moving toward mainstream adoption. This year, Messari made headlines when CEO Ryan Selkis resigned after a series of controversial tweets about U.S. immigrants, violence toward Trump opponents, and civil war. During 2021’s Mainnet event, the SEC served two subpoenas to the speaker of the event, Terraform Labs founder and then-CEO Do Kwon. Kwon, once a crypto king, was arrested in March 2023 for forging travel documents while trying to flee Montenegro. He is currently awaiting extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea, where he faces potential charges. At this year’s conference, Messari introduced Messari Copilot, an AI assistant designed for the crypto industry. This tool delivers text-based answers to user queries based on Messari’s research and data, providing a comprehensive view of the crypto landscape.

Title: BREAKING: Bitwise files for XRP ETF via Delaware trust

Time Published: 2024-10-01T19:31:47Z

Share this article Crypto asset manager Bitwise has taken a step toward launching an XRP ETF. According to a filing with the Delaware Division of Corporations, the company has established a trust that could serve as the foundation for a potential XRP ETF. As of this writing, no corresponding documentation has appeared in the SEC’s EDGAR database, which is the typical repository for official ETF proposals. This action follows a pattern seen in the crypto ETF sector, where asset managers create trusts before seeking approval from the SEC for an exchange-traded product. The filing has drawn attention within the crypto community, particularly among those interested in XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple. XRP has been a subject of regulatory scrutiny in recent years. The path to an approved XRP ETF may face challenges. The SEC has approached crypto-based ETFs with caution, only recently approving Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs after a lengthy process of applications and regulatory discussions. Bitwise’s action follows the launch of Bitcoin ETFs by firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity earlier this year. These approvals marked a shift in the regulatory landscape for crypto investment products. A potential XRP ETF would represent another development in the integration of digital assets into traditional finance. However, regulatory approval is not assured, and the process could be lengthy. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Bitwise’s filing for an XRP trust via Delaware is a development that market participants are watching. It could potentially lead to new investment vehicles for XRP, a crypto that has been the subject of ongoing regulatory and market debates. Last month, Grayscale introduced an XRP trust in the US targeting accredited investors, potentially paving the way for an ETF conversion, amidst Ripple’s ongoing legal confrontations with the SEC.

Title: Defense Stocks Hit All-Time Highs Amid Middle East Escalation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/01/defense-stocks-hit-all-time-highs-amid-middle-east-escalation/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T19:25:25Z

In a predictably grim phenomenon tied to outbreaks of global violence, aerospace and defense stocks climbed to record prices in an otherwise down day for the stock market, as Wall Street reacted to the latest escalation in the Middle East by anticipating larger contracts for military suppliers. Lockheed Martin stock rose Tuesday to a record high. The stocks of several major U.S. defense contractors rallied Tuesday, as Lockheed Martin, RTX (previously Raytheon), Northrop Grumman and L3Harris all gained more than 2.6%, rising as the Israeli military reported missile strikes from Iran a day after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon in its conflict against Hezbollah. Both Lockheed Martin and RTX shares booked all-time highs Tuesday, while L3Harris and Northrop Grumman tallied their top share price since 2022. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense exchange-traded fund rose 1.2% as the BlackRock-managed fund indexing the sector hit a new all-time high of its own, extending its 12-month gain to 43%, beating the baseline S&P 500’s 33% rise over the period. The defense stock rally came as the broader market slid, with the S&P falling 0.8%, tracking toward its worst loss since Sept. 6. The decreased risk appetite tied to the war was one of several negative catalysts for the broader market, as investors digested inflation concerns tied to the dock worker strike and shares of Apple, by far the largest company in the world by market value, fell 3% on reports of light iPhone 16 demand. 5%. That’s how much prices for international oil benchmark Brent crude oil rose Tuesday by about 1:15 p.m. EDT, which would have been by far the largest single-day gain of 2024, according to FactSet data. The oil surge moderated quickly, with Brent up less than 1% by 3:15 p.m. EDT. Defense stocks typically gain during times of heightened conflict as the companies’ revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts, which often grow when allies like Israel and Ukraine are at war. Tuesday’s market backdrop evoked unpleasant memories of the setup in late 2021 and 2022, when supply chain issues and military conflict (Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) caused global inflation to surge and stocks to fall as central banks rolled out growth-stifling interest rate hikes to slow price increases. But economists largely believe the U.S. port strike won’t have the same impact on inflation as the 2021-22 supply chain snags. Wall Street’s fear gauge rose to its highest level in three weeks Tuesday, as the CBOE volatility index (VIX) climbed 10% as traders dealt with new concerns in addition to fears about a potential U.S. economic slowdown. But “although the VIX is edging higher it remains sufficiently just below 20 to suggest that markets…do not yet envision an all-out military scenario” in the Middle East, noted LPL Financial’s chief global strategist Quincy Krosby in a Tuesday note to clients. ​​ One Community.

Title: GLP-1s like Ozempic are now more popular than insulin for treating diabetes
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-glp-1s-insulin-tirlliant-health-report-1851662409
Time Published: 2024-10-01T19:16:00Z

It took GLP-1 medications like Ozempic just seven years to surpass insulin as the the second most common treatment for type 2 diabetes, according to a new report by the market research and analytics firm Trilliant Health. GLP-1 drugs rose from the eighth most common drug regimen for type 2 diabetes in 2018, a year after Ozempic launched in the U.S., to the second most common in 2023, according to Trilliant’s 2024 Trends Shaping the Health Economy Report. Insulin fell to third place last year. Metformin, which regulates blood sugar levels by reducing how much glucose is released from the liver and helping the body to absorb more glucose from the bloodstream, remained on top over the past six years as the leading drug for type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 drugs, which work by mimicking hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have also recently become highly sought after for their slimming side effects. In 2023, Ozempic was Novo Nordisk’s best-selling drug, with sales reaching 31 billion Danish kroner ($14 billion). Soaring demand for these treatments have turned Novo Nordisk (NVO) and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of Mounjaro, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs, known as GLP-1/GIP treatments, will reach $105 billion by 2030. And their influence is still growing. According to Trilliant’s report, GLP-1s could boost or bring down demand for other medical treatments like gastrointestinal (GI) medications and bariatric surgeries. In the year after patients start a GLP-1 treatment, the proportion of patients with a GI-related diagnosis increased by one percentage point to 11.3% and the proportion of patients taking a GI-related medication increased by 3.7 percentage points to 33%, according to Trilliant Health Trilliant also projected that if GLP-1 drugs replaced just 20% of bariatric surgeries providers could stand to lose up to $533.4 million in revenue. “As new therapies become available and emerging evidence is incorporated into clinical guidelines, it is likely that some highmargin surgical procedures will be replaced by less invasive interventions, or there will be a decline in downstream demand,” the report said.

Full Content:
Cerebras Systems, an artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker looking to compete with the biggest tech firms in the industry like Nvidia (NVDA), filed for an initial public offering (IPO) Monday, with the goal of listing on the Nasdaq under the "CBRS" stock ticker. The company, founded in 2016, has spent the last several years designing chips specifically for AI technology. In its prospectus filed Monday, Cerebras said it has worked to answer the question of how it would design chips if it were starting the design process from scratch. The company says that its design process has led it to create a chip substantially larger than those created by competitors, to avoid the complex process of connecting them and to provide greater on-chip memory and bandwidth. In its prospectus, Cerebras reported a $66.6 million net loss for the first six months of 2024 on $136.4 million in total revenue, compared with a wider $77.8 million net loss and $8.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2023, as it said associated costs rose substantially year-over-year with increased production. It listed its competition as chipmakers including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC), along with Big Tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have begun designing and producing their own AI chips. Cerebras didn't disclose how many shares it intends to offer, or what its IPO price will be, but clearly the potential IPO was announced at a time when companies are looking to capitalize on the market's enthusiasm for the AI industry.

The U.S. had warned earlier that a ballistic missile strike from Iran was being prepared against the foreign ally. Later, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations said on Twitter (aka X) that Tehran's response “has been duly carried out.” Bitcoin’s price fell 3.2% to $61,300 amid the volley, hitting its lowest price in two weeks, though it has ticked back up to $62,200 as of this writing. The dip reflected a lackluster start to so-called Uptober, a period of historically seasonal strength for “risk assets” like stocks and crypto. Is the Uptober in the room with us right now? pic.twitter.com/FAzk7quFkI — Pop Punk (@PopPunkOnChain) October 1, 2024 While Bitcoin has gained traction among investors as a “store of value asset” against inflation, the coin hasn’t consistently performed well as a “flight to quality asset” during times of geopolitical conflict, Grayscale Investment’s Managing Director of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt. “Investors who are concerned about high geopolitical risks are, for now, still reaching for the traditional instruments,” he said, pointing to physical gold and U.S. Treasury bonds. Despite Tuesday’s dip, Pandl added that Bitcoin’s correlation with risk assets could shift alongside Bitcoin’s adoption by countries in the coming years. “In the longer term, when Bitcoin is widely held around the world and a reserve asset for central banks and governments, it may also be a common flight-to-quality asset,” Pandl said. “But Bitcoin is still much earlier in its journey than treasury bonds or gold.” While bursts of geopolitical conflict have previously dented Bitcoin’s price, asset managers like BlackRock have recently highlighted Bitcoin’s ability to serve as a hedge. This month, the firm said Bitcoin can diversify against “geopolitical tensions, concerns over the state of U.S. debt and deficits, and increased political instability.” President Joe Biden said Sunday that an all-out-war in the Middle East must be avoided as Israeli airstrikes battered Lebanon, killing dozens of people, per the Associated Press. The strikes followed last week’s killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a major blow to the Iran-backed militant group and political party in Lebanon. Bitcoin: “We’re a global reserve of value like digital gold, that you want to hold in uncertain times” Bitcoin during WWIII: *Dumps* https://t.co/vVVLXMuhYG — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) October 1, 2024 The escalation between Israel and Iran caused Bitcoin to sell off “sharply,” according to André Dragosch, Bitwise’s European Head of Research. But he said on Twitter (aka X) Tuesday that Bitcoin has “historically performed relatively well following major geopolitical risk events,” adding that “geopolitical news should generally be faded.” Tuesday’s unease was reflected in crude oil prices, as WTI spiked 3.6% past $70 a barrel. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) rose 0.5%, reversing weakness seen in the dollar’s strength since mid-September. Gold jumped 1.3% to $2,670 per ounce. Stocks were down, however, alongside leading cryptocurrencies. If rising oil prices translate into rising consumer prices, Pandl said the Federal Reserve is unlikely to abandon its easing campaign. He contrasted supply shocks with the possibility of persistent demand from China’s oil-hungry economy post-stimulus. “I think it would be likely that the Fed would look through any temporary increase in inflation,” he said. “A more important consideration could be [...] the huge stimulus that we've seen from the Chinese government in the last couple of weeks.” Bitcoin’s price plunged in April alongside geopolitical conflict in the Middle East after Israel struck Iran with a barrage of missiles. The dip to $60,000 was preceded a week earlier by missile and drone strikes in the region that also rattled Bitcoin’s price. In February 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had an instantaneous impact on the crypto market. Bitcoin’s price dropped 9% to around $35,000, as $200 million was swiftly wiped away from the global market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s negative performance following geopolitical risk events is quite common, Bitwise's Dragosch told Decrypt in a statement. At the same time, Bitcoin’s track record suggests they have short-term impact on the asset’s price before exhibiting “significantly positive performance.” Dragosch referenced research he published with ETC Group earlier this year, which found that Bitcoin saw outsized returns following geopolitical risk events in the past, from France launching airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria in 2017 to the aftermath of Osama bin Laden’s death in 2011. The research discussed how Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship and lack of counterparty risk align with the characteristics of safe-haven assets. Additionally, Bitcoin’s newfound scarcity with each so-called halving could bolster its performance relative to gold. “It is still a risky asset but its character will likely continue to change over the long run with every halving and increasing scarcity,” Dragosch said. “Bitcoin has evolved from a very risky asset to a safer asset over the past years.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Editor's note: This story was updated after publications with additional analyst comments and detail.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed in tandem with stock markets on Oct. 1 as tensions continued to escalate in the Middle East after Israel announced ground operations in Lebanon, which has prompted Iran to take action. The official account of Israel Defense Forces on X shared at 4:36 P.M. UTC that Iran was firing rockets at Israeli territory. Additionally, reports claim that Iran is likely to send a second wave of missiles targeting Israel in the ensuing hours. As a result, over $489 million was liquidated over the past 24 hours, with the majority of liquidations — $312 million — occurring within the past four hours, according to Coinglass data. Long liquidations accounted for $416.6 million of the total, while short liquidations amounted to roughly $73 million. According to CryptoSlate data, BTC was trading at $61,598 as of press time, down 3% over the past day. Major altcoins displayed heavier corrections following the news. Ethereum (ETH) was down 4.31% as of press time and trading at $2,490, while Solana (SOL) was down over 5.51% and trading at $146.8.

Jeroen Blokland, founder of the Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, stated on X that investors are “literally selling” BTC to buy gold amid the intensification of the conflict. However, he added that Bitcoin’s average return as a hedge against geopolitical events has proven to be a good decision since 2020. Citing a BlackRock report, Blokland highlighted that BTC outpaced the 60-day returns of SPX and gold during the US-Iran conflict and Covid outbreak in 2020, the deflagration of war between Russia and Ukraine in 2022, and the US banking crisis in 2023.

Title: Buy Costco and American Express stock as inflation cools, analyst says

Full Content:
Shelby McFaddin, an investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Q3 earnings are starting to roll in. What companies’ earnings do you expect to move markets? SHELBY MCFADDIN (SM): I think, as usual, fortunately-unfortunately, the big market movers are going to continue to be those that benefit from AI because they are such a big part of the concentration at the top. So when we think about what there will be news about versus what’s gonna move the market, it’s going to be the former, where we’re looking at the Nvidias of the world, the Microsofts, everything like that. But I think some of the companies that could be making news, even if they don’t have as much influence over the broad market, are companies that face the worst of the worst during the hiking cycle. So that could be companies that are in the credit bureau — something like TransUnion (TRU), where they have gone through a sort of drought with credit card applications and mortgage applications coming down and they’re now starting to see sort of the light at the end of the tunnel. And they also benefit or are hoping to benefit from the sort of reinvigoration of ad spend and marketing spend from various companies in retail and beyond that are relying on some of those sorts of identity services that companies like TransUnion provide. AM: What other opportunities are you seeing? SM: Another opportunity, similarly in the consumer vein and in consumer financial, would be American Express (AXP). And that’s because they sort of already have this grip on the premium end of the customer. So they were already quite resilient when things were looking down in that payment space. And now, going into a lower-rate environment where credit conditions are a little bit softer, they can start to expand the base again — rather, not the base, but they have landed, they can expand again where they’re capturing millennial spend, a little bit of Gen Z spend, and not having to be as picky, as meticulous about who is on the books. They can go ahead and get more consumers in their ecosystem, and that’s a win for them. So they have been able to win in this period — one, from maintaining some of their customers and then also having higher rates in terms of their lending products. And then now, as rates will slowly come down — yes, those rates on lending will come down a bit — they can go ahead and increase the number of cardholders they have. AM: Another one of your picks is Costco. Can you tell me about that? SM: The great thing about Costco (COST) for consumers and shareholders is that they’ve just got such great management at the helm that they really do deliver to all the stakeholders. Consumers have actually been able to see prices come down really before the rate-cut discussion started happening. If we were tuning in on the quarterly calls, they would very excitedly discuss “Here are 10 products where we’ve cut prices” because management was genuinely excited to be able to get those back down. So they’re pretty much always pricing at cost — they’re trying to give you the best value they can. We would expect to see any pricing there move in accordance with, really, what they’re seeing in supply. I would expect with other places, you might see a little bit more stickiness; where there’s less white label at certain retailers, you might see a little bit more stickiness; where there’s more premium, you might see something a little bit more sticky. When we think about the Kirkland brand, what they’re able to do at the cost that they’re able to do it is really just first in class. So I would expect that they continue to get rewarded for the fact that they are drawing in consumers looking for value. AM: Gotcha. So Costco might be a pick. SM: Absolutely. Is the valuation quite rich? A hundred percent. We are constantly asking ourselves as a team: What is this really worth, and is the market arriving at this particular price? But in terms of just the fundamentals and how well the business is run, it is something we are excited to own. AM: Awesome. Thanks so much, Shelby.

Title: Buy Costco and American Express stock as inflation cools, analyst says

Shelby McFaddin, an investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Q3 earnings are starting to roll in. What companies’ earnings do you expect to move markets? SHELBY MCFADDIN (SM): I think, as usual, fortunately-unfortunately, the big market movers are going to continue to be those that benefit from AI because they are such a big part of the concentration at the top. So when we think about what there will be news about versus what’s gonna move the market, it’s going to be the former, where we’re looking at the Nvidias of the world, the Microsofts, everything like that. But I think some of the companies that could be making news, even if they don’t have as much influence over the broad market, are companies that face the worst of the worst during the hiking cycle. So that could be companies that are in the credit bureau — something like TransUnion (TRU), where they have gone through a sort of drought with credit card applications and mortgage applications coming down and they’re now starting to see sort of the light at the end of the tunnel. And they also benefit or are hoping to benefit from the sort of reinvigoration of ad spend and marketing spend from various companies in retail and beyond that are relying on some of those sorts of identity services that companies like TransUnion provide. AM: What other opportunities are you seeing? SM: Another opportunity, similarly in the consumer vein and in consumer financial, would be American Express (AXP). And that’s because they sort of already have this grip on the premium end of the customer. So they were already quite resilient when things were looking down in that payment space. And now, going into a lower-rate environment where credit conditions are a little bit softer, they can start to expand the base again — rather, not the base, but they have landed, they can expand again where they’re capturing millennial spend, a little bit of Gen Z spend, and not having to be as picky, as meticulous about who is on the books. They can go ahead and get more consumers in their ecosystem, and that’s a win for them. So they have been able to win in this period — one, from maintaining some of their customers and then also having higher rates in terms of their lending products. And then now, as rates will slowly come down — yes, those rates on lending will come down a bit — they can go ahead and increase the number of cardholders they have. AM: Another one of your picks is Costco. Can you tell me about that? SM: The great thing about Costco (COST) for consumers and shareholders is that they’ve just got such great management at the helm that they really do deliver to all the stakeholders. Consumers have actually been able to see prices come down really before the rate-cut discussion started happening. If we were tuning in on the quarterly calls, they would very excitedly discuss “Here are 10 products where we’ve cut prices” because management was genuinely excited to be able to get those back down. So they’re pretty much always pricing at cost — they’re trying to give you the best value they can. We would expect to see any pricing there move in accordance with, really, what they’re seeing in supply. I would expect with other places, you might see a little bit more stickiness; where there’s less white label at certain retailers, you might see a little bit more stickiness; where there’s more premium, you might see something a little bit more sticky. When we think about the Kirkland brand, what they’re able to do at the cost that they’re able to do it is really just first in class. So I would expect that they continue to get rewarded for the fact that they are drawing in consumers looking for value. AM: Gotcha. So Costco might be a pick. SM: Absolutely.

Investors have shown increased confidence in MQT, as it outperforms expectations amidst fluctuating market conditions, signaling robust growth potential for the municipal bond-focused fund. The 52-week high milestone underscores the fund's resilience and the growing investor appetite for quality municipal bond investments.

Title: CVS Health to lay off nearly 3,000 workers in cost-cutting drive

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Title: Smite Developer Hi-Rez Lays Off Employees, Focusing on Smite 2
URL: https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T16:16:23Z
Full Content:
Hi-Rez has announced that they have made layoffs within the company as part of an "internal reorganization and prioritization." Smite 2 is already in Early Access but requires those who are interested in playing it to purchase the Founder's Pack first before the game goes free-to-play after the first year. Studio Head Steward Chisam made a lengthy post on X, saying that the changes that Hi-Rez have made are "difficult but necessary" to be able to ensure that Smite 2 has a "long and sustainable future." Smite was first released in 2014, using Unreal Engine 3. The game has been ported to PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and even Amazon Luna. The only place players can't play the game is on mobile. Smite has been a hugely successful game in the MOBA genre, with there being many characters to choose from and a big esports scene with multiple tournaments, which also includes the annual million-dollar Smite World Championship. Chisam hasn't disclosed how many were laid off in the restructuring and said that "this will disproportionately impact those in marketing and publishing roles, as well as some from our Evil Mojo, G&A, and Titan Forge divisions." It's said that there will still be some developers working in small teams on Paladins and Smite to provide light updates to the games, but most of the studio is now shifting its focus entirely over to Smite 2. In the post, it's said that the team is now pivoting their focus on "gameplay development in the near term," which will include new modes, Gods, and quality-of-life improvements for the title rather than focusing on cosmetic and monetization features, which was originally the game plan for the Smite 2 team. Chisam has said that this has "a real human impact at a tough time," but also states that Smite 2's development team overall is larger than Smite's "throughout most of its life cycle. The team working on Gods and gameplay features (versus skins and monetization/progression/system features) is larger than the Smite 1 team ever was for such features. In this lengthy statement, it's also mentioned that they want to make Smite 2 the best possible game experience that can sustain itself "long into the 2030s." As the game is still in the Alpha stage, it's said that they have learned a lot about the process of "migrating gods from Smite 1 to Smite 2. We're doubling down on ensuring this transition meets players expectations and moves faster." Whether the amount of layoffs will be disclosed in the future is uncertain, and replies to the post have been turned off.

Title: Here’s The Actual Reason Why The World’s Second-Largest Asset Manager Vanguard Snubbed Bitcoin ETFs
URL: https://zycrypto.com/heres-the-actual-reason-why-the-worlds-second-largest-asset-manager-vanguard-snubbed-bitcoin-etfs/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T16:02:04Z
Full Content:
Back in 2017, legendary investor Jack Bogle infamously cautioned investors to “avoid Bitcoin like the plague”. Roughly seven years later, Vanguard has still ignited the ire of crypto enthusiasts by sticking to the conservative investment principles of its late founder. Despite the euphoria unleashed by chief rival BlackRock being among the issuers of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on American stock exchanges, Vanguard still won’t touch the new BTC products with a ten-foot pole. Bloomberg’s top ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has revealed why Vanguard, which currently holds approximately $7.2 trillion in assets under management, continues to shun Bitcoin spot investment vehicles, unlike its peers. According to Balchunas, the Pennsylvania-based company has traditionally steered clear of commodities, which Bogle dismissed as “total speculation” since they are “only worth what someone else will pay you.” Bogle favored assets with intrinsic cash flow over mere commodities like Bitcoin. Even as billions flowed into the newly-launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard has maintained that it has no plans to offer its clients any crypto-related products. The Bloomberg ETF pundit described Vanguard’s paternalistic decision to block Bitcoin ETFs on its enormous trading platform as “a bit nanny state-ish.” He contends that their “highly intelligent” investors should be able to decide for themselves whether or not they want to gain direct exposure to the burgeoning crypto. Vanguard’s rejection of Bitcoin and crypto in general stands in contrast to its industry peers. BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Invesco have all debuted spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs this year, while major US banks like JPMorgan are serving as authorized participants for the products. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Vanguard named Salim Ramji, a former BlackRock executive who oversaw the company’s launch of its Bitcoin ETF (iShares Bitcoin Trust), as its new CEO. This move triggered chatter on social media that the asset manager might change its stance. However, despite his BTC-friendliness at BlackRock, Ramji quickly poured water on the idea that he has intentions for Vanguard to offer its clientele trading access to any of the multiple spot Bitcoin products on the market. That being said, despite the asset management behemoth eschewing Bitcoin ETFs, it still has indirect exposure in the dominant cryptocurrency by market cap as it is presently the second-biggest institutional holder of MicroStrategy — the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Title: Major Bitcoin Miner CEO Reveals Unveils His Plan For AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/01/major-bitcoin-miner-ceo-reveals-unveils-his-plan-for-ai/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T14:36:06Z
Full Content:
MARA CEO Fred Thiel thinks that retail investors are giving small competitors too much credit for artificial intelligence plays that will not pay off for years. He has a vision for his company that plays to its core strengths. Marathon CEO Fred Thiel is making a play for the AI market on his terms Fred Thiel is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of MARA, bringing over 35 years of extensive experience in the technology sector. In this discussion we cover a wide range of issues including how Marathon is adapting to the wave of smaller miners gravitating towards artificial intelligence, what separates his firm from some of the other pure-play miners, and how U.S. politics and the upcoming presidential election will affect the outlook for the mining industry. Forbes: Can you give an overview of how you've tried to position Marathon Digital Holdings within the world of bitcoin mining? Fred Thiel: We look at ourselves as sitting at the point of convergence between energy transformation and digital infrastructure. From a bitcoin mining perspective, we're the largest of the publicly traded miners today, operating 13 sites across four continents. We use a variety of different technologies and we're the only one of the large bitcoin miners that has a fully vertically integrated tech stack. What that means is we operate our own mining pool, which is what orchestrates all our miners around the world and is the interface to the Bitcoin blockchain. All the other miners use third-party pools that are either Foundry, for example, or Chinese pools. We also operate our own firmware, which runs in miners and then we have developed and designed our own cooling infrastructure. We have single-phase and dual-phase liquid cooling, both of which don't use water, so that is totally water-free, and this is a really exciting area as we move into providing digital infrastructure to the AI industry because it's the exact same infrastructure that's used by both industries. The other thing that is unique is we cofounded a company called Auradine, which is the only U.S. bitcoin mining ASIC manufacturer. Their miners can support multiple chip failures and still run so they can operate in wider temperature ranges. So what does that all add up to? To me, it means as a miner we have access to technologies that not necessarily other miners do and we continue to press the envelope on deploying that technology. Our data center in Abu Dhabi, which is all liquid immersion cooling, is a preeminent site. There are two data centers, a total of 250 megawatts, that have 99.8% uptime running in a very harsh environment, which is obviously the Middle East desert next to a body of water. It's very humid so liquid cooling is the only way to go. Our strategy initially was one of being asset light. We focused on just growing rapidly by hosting with third parties. Then earlier this year we shifted to vertically integrating and we acquired 54% of our capacity’s infrastructure, and as we continue to grow in coming years that number will get closer and closer to 100%. We tripled our capacity in 2023, we'll double it again this year and we'll continue to grow at a pretty great rate. Lastly, we're the second largest holder of bitcoin of publicly traded companies in the U.S. and our strategic focus really is to amass as much bitcoin as we can. That's our core treasury asset and we do that through mining and also going into the markets and buying opportunistically when it makes sense. Forbes: What metrics do you pay the most attention to and how does the development and investment you detailed help give you a leg up on the pure bitcoin miners? Thiel: A couple of things. I talked about how we operate 13 sites on four continents. We don't have a concentration in a particular region or state. Riot Platforms is 100% concentrated in Texas today. They're trying to solve that by acquiring Bitfarms and then they've acquired another small site, I think in Kentucky. CleanSpark was heavily focused on Georgia. Now they're focusing on Kentucky as well. The challenge with being focused on just one area is you're very susceptible to your energy utility and energy market pricing in that region. In the case of Riot, they have the double whammy of two big sites in Texas and you have curtailment issues, weather issues and community issues, which in Texas are not small things. In the case of CleanSpark, they operate lots of very small sites. Operationally that is a very different issue because now you have to have people spread all over managing these disparate small sites and it may mean you don't have the opportunity to really aggregate the scale and get the benefits of scale in the same way. But Marathon is operating on different continents, so we also have the ability to avoid the risk of regulatory regime issues in the U.S. For example, in the Biden budget, there were attacks specifically on energy used by bitcoin mining. The Harris administration seems like they are befriending AI, but they are still going to be antagonistic to bitcoin mining. By the way, you can't give AI energy at one price and not give bitcoin mining energy at the same price. Not only would the industry attack that issue, but it's a type of commercial discrimination, which could be viewed as illegal. But more importantly, there is a huge symbiosis between AI and bitcoin mining because AI workloads vary just like demand on the grid varies and bitcoin miners have a unique ability to synchronize their load to AI miners loads such that you don't get this huge variance of demand on the grid. So when you marry bitcoin miners and AI operators together, you get a much better grid profile. You have the ability to stabilize the load, and you have an ability to use more of the intermittent energy—solar, wind—than AI can use. If you look at our technology piece, operating our own pool, it's very transparent to our investors; they can see every block that we win. By operating your own pool, you do a couple of things. One is you pay a pool operator a percentage of your winnings for them to operate the pool. It's 1% or 2% depending on the size of the miner; we don't have to do that. Then we have systems like Slipstream, a non-standard block submittal service that people in the Ordinals world really love. It allows us to get higher fees for submitting blocks to the network than the normal mempool would pay, so that gives us additional revenues on top of the traditional transaction fees that we get. We also have a Layer 2 called Anduro, which people are now starting to develop applications on. Forbes: Can you speak a little more about how Anduro is constructed? Thiel: It's a Bitcoin L2 that is essentially a clone of the Bitcoin network. It can process transactions much faster. It can do things that you can't really do as easily on the L1 of Bitcoin, but it anchors all its security, and it's pegged to the L1. You can, for example, do transactions in a much easier way than you can with lightning. Lightning requires you to open channels and close channels. This is a true sidechain, so you could build a digital identity network on it. You could build a MLS for real estate on it. You could build a transaction processing system for credit card remittances, whatever you may want to have. One of the applications that’s been built on it, which will be released soon, is called Alys, and Alys is a full EMV system from the Ethereum world that lets you take an application built for Ethereum and port it directly to Bitcoin. And then going back to our liquid cooling technology and the ASIC technology, we have technology advantages in that we can build miners specific to the use case. So in Finland for example, we have a small data center that heats 11,000 homes. How are we doing that? We're doing it through district heating by capturing heat from the miners. We have the ability to build custom miners for use cases. We recently made an investment in a company in San Diego, and what they do is they go in and they over-dimension solar systems for homes with solar panels and batteries and they use the excess capacity to mine bitcoin. Realize that solar energy has zero marginal cost, and so if you put 10 kilowatts of panels on a house versus six kilowatts of panels, the only difference in cost is the capital expenditure for the panels. Then all that extra energy can be used for bitcoin mining. More importantly, you can also heat water with the heat from the bitcoin miners. And what they do is they provision this and then they sell electricity to the consumer at 25% below market price. That fits into this model of the long tail of bitcoin mining, which is highly decentralized bitcoin mining, putting it out at the edge and leveraging zero-cost energy. So what you'll see from us over the next couple of years is a move towards the cost to mine being covered by services we're providing to the parties with which we’re partnered. That’s an obtuse way of saying we believe–and we're in the process of signing agreements with large partners–that people will pay us for the benefits of marrying bitcoin mining to different applications. And in doing so, our cost of energy will go towards zero. Forbes: Hash price continues to go down, and your stock price, along with other pure-play miners, has trailed that of Bitcoin and some of the other smaller miners that have made more direct overtures towards AI. What do you think of those things? Thiel: A couple of things. At the beginning of this year you started to see the shift from bitcoin miners to kind of MicroStrategy and the ETFs because of the coming halving. Any miner was suddenly going to produce half as much bitcoin, and so their costs were going to go up. Essentially, they'd be less profitable, so it's only logical to think that their market cap would be impacted. At the same time, MicroStrategy was out there buying $2 billion worth of bitcoin, and that became very attractive for people to do. The investment community–I'll go away from the retail side for a minute–the hedge funds, the volatility investors, love bitcoin mining because you get a lot more alpha than you did just by investing in bitcoin. It's the same reason Warren Buffett invested in gold miners versus gold because he likes the fact that when gold price runs up, gold miners’ cost to extract doesn't necessarily go up. The same generally holds with bitcoin miners. There's a six to nine-month lag as bitcoin price runs up before the cost to mine really starts jumping because the cost of mine is driven by either energy costs or global hash rate and the difficulty rate going up. And so if you have to go buy new capacity, buy new miners and deploy them, there's a six to nine month lag in that process. So you have this period of high profit when bitcoin price moves quickly. When bitcoin price does not move quickly, it moves sideways, buying spot bitcoin is much smarter and that also gives you an insight into our HODL strategy and why we go and buy bitcoin in the market sometimes. But MicroStrategy and Marathon and the other big miners have options that there's an options market. And so the ball players love it. They can do all sorts of very creative stuff and if you look at the stock prices, they tend to move pretty much in a pattern where they move up at the beginning of the week and down at the back half of the week. And that all has to do with selling calls and then buying back the calls after you short the stock. You can see very specific trading patterns for all the companies. The smaller guys were generally ignored previously, and now people have said the big guys are well-valued, and the smaller guys should be valued similarly on a per exhash basis. I think they're giving the small guys too much credit. Look at Cipher, they've signed up 350 megawatts of new stuff, but it's not going to come online for 12 to 18 months, yet the stock price goes up. So that's retail chasing that. Our investor makeup interestingly has changed this year in that in the first quarter we had about 39% institutional and now we're up closer to 60%. The institutional investors are seeing the value in our story because of how we position the transition to AI. I do not think that a miner like TerraWulf or Hut8 can go and build and operate a hosting center for AI very effectively. It is not the same thing as running a bitcoin mining site. Forbes: What is the investor makeup? Are these buy and hold investors? Thiel: Our single biggest shareholder today is BlackRock. They hold 13% to 14% of our shares, in both their managed and unmanaged funds. Same thing with Fidelity. You have basically BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, and then some long list of others after that. But I think what we're certainly seeing when we're out talking to investors is the people who are starting to talk to us with interest are the ones who are looking at what we're doing around AI infrastructure and how that opportunity is very different from traditional bitcoin mining. Traditional bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game, and every four years, you get slapped in the face with a price increase effectively. As you start looking at digital infrastructure in the AI space, you now have the benefit of providing technology or services to these hyperscalers. The area we believe is most interesting is AI at the edge, which is all about inference. The inference marketplace is still two to three years from growing a lot because people are still busy building these LLMs [large language models]. If you read Sam Altman's white paper that he published recently, basically, his argument is you have to invest heavily in LLMs so that you have essentially something for inference to query. The way I put it is LLMs are the brain and inference is how you make money off of AI. Inference is the digital twin that is sitting in a factory, running a factory, and leveraging a model that sits up in the cloud, and the model is updated daily, sent back down to the edge, and it operates at the edge. There will be tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of these modular data centers that do inference at the edges spread all over the place. Forbes: Let’s talk more about the HODL strategy. You've hinted at some very strategic decisions that affect how you leverage your balance sheet when updating equipment and making investments versus procuring bitcoin on the spot market. Can you break that down a little more? Thiel: When you are investing in bitcoin mining, you are betting on the fact that you will be able to produce bitcoin at a lower cost than you could acquire it in the open marketplace. So if I'm going to spend $100 million dollars and buy bitcoin, I get that bitcoin tomorrow, and then I get the benefit of its price appreciation over the hold period, and let's just say I'm going to hold it for 36 months. If you assume it will go up 20%-plus a year, you have that price appreciation in the bitcoin, and your basis is today's price. If you are going to go into the mining business, your bet is I'm going to invest $100 million dollars in infrastructure that will likely go live in about 12 months on average. It could be shorter if you're buying an existing site that's running and you're just going to replace the miners. And so you need to over the following 24 months, mine not just as much bitcoin as you acquired where you bought the bitcoin today, but enough bitcoin so you're also covering your cost of power, etc., such that at the end of the period of time you end up with more dollar value of bitcoin than you did just by buying it today. What that requires is a belief in what the price of bitcoin is going to do in the long term. And so when we have access to capital, there are times when we will choose to go into the market and buy bitcoin versus invest it in adding more mining capacity because sometimes there's a lag in how long it takes for us to deploy the capital when we're adding mining capacity. Forbes: You recently met with Donald Trump. Can you share your experiences or takeaways from that round table? Thiel: Former President Trump has been very well briefed and understands the value proposition that bitcoin provides to the U.S. as a country and the opportunity that bitcoin mining provides for the U.S. to be the dominant player in processing bitcoin transactions and securing the bitcoin blockchain. It's a little bit like the gold reserves the U.S. holds. The U.S. holds 40% of the gold reserves of the world because in the event there was ever an attack on the U.S. dollar, you have the gold reserves that you can use. The U.S. also happens to have custody of the majority of other countries’ gold. As you know, Russia got on the wrong side of that with the sanctions program. Many nations have figured out that with the weaponization of the dollar, they need to be able to hold assets in something other than the dollar. So they're now evaluating holding things in amongst other things, bitcoin as well as gold and other assets. And not that they will hold all their reserves in bitcoin, but they may decide to hold somewhere between 1% to 10%, depending on the country and their risk profile. I don't think the Saudis, if you were to talk to them, would say that they consider the rupee, the ruble or some of these other currencies as good reserve assets, and so they're still going to put their faith in the dollar. But they want to have a hedge, and they want to have something that provides a risk-adjusted return potentially better than just placing their money in dollar assets because a lot of the countries today outside of the U.S. are being very cautious about their buying of Treasury bills, for example. The sixth largest buyer of Treasury bills today is Tether [according to Investopedia]. It's not a country. It's a stablecoin. So what you're starting to see is people who want to have dollar-denominated stablecoins end up being the biggest holders of Treasury bills. Then you have to look at bonds and who wants to hold those? The Chinese certainly aren't buying them anymore nor are a lot of other countries. So if a sovereign is going to hold bitcoin, then the sovereign has to be guaranteed that they can transact it. Because if all bitcoin mining happens in the U.S. or the U.S. has a significant amount of bitcoin mining going on, then the U.S., in theory, could sanction a country by forcing U.S. bitcoin miners through legal regulation to not mine certain transactions because they're on OFAC sanction lists, for example. That could restrict somebody from transacting where, let's just say you had 60% of mining in the U.S., well, six out of 10 blocks, meaning somebody would only be able to transact in four out of any 10 blocks. That happens, and if you've got enough countries in the world to go against one country, you could potentially almost block them out. So sovereigns who are going to hold bitcoin have a need to have mining in their country. Bhutan is a great example. Bhutan holds $1 billion of bitcoin. They also have a lot of mining in their country. El Salvador now has stated that they no longer need third-party debt because they mine and hold bitcoin. So the U.S. should hold bitcoin just like they hold gold, and the U.S. should ensure that a certain percentage of the global hashrate comes from the U.S. so that all the bitcoin held in the U.S. by ETFs and these other funds can be transacted if need be. Forbes: Trump has said that he would like to see all remaining bitcoin mined in the U.S. That might be just politicking more than a serious policy statement, but I'm interested in your thoughts, given what you just mentioned. Thiel: I'm not going to put words in his mouth, but I think he views it as strategic importance for the U.S. to be a dominant player in bitcoin mining. And I think sometimes when he says dominant, he'll say, we have to be the end all. He wants that in the way of bitcoin mining and in the U.S. holding bitcoin reserves just like the gold aspect. You've seen him recently talk about if the U.S. were to hold a lot of bitcoin it could potentially appreciate to a point that it could pay for part of the debt or even all the debt. Representative Paulina Luna, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and others are all believers in these programs. We think it's certainly a very wise choice because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. So it's just a question of who will own them over what period of time. Being shareholders in and having cofounded the only U.S. ASIC manufacturer for bitcoin mining, we’re certainly big believers in bitcoin miners made in the USA. You could argue that Chinese companies make 75% of the bitcoin miners made in the world today. I'm not saying that they're trying to do anything bad, but it does provide them an ability to essentially somewhat control the supply and the pricing of bitcoin miners. Forbes: That concentration can be dangerous in anything. Thiel: Exactly. So that's why we're big advocates. Regardless of who wins the presidential election, there may be opportunities to do something about that from a tariff perspective. Forbes: Have you had any interactions with the Harris campaign? Thiel: We have talked with the head of the DNC. We have talked with all sorts of senators and the Harris team does not want to engage with us. They have engaged with the AI industry. My belief is that, unfortunately, Senator Warren and her anti-crypto army have a fairly strong lock on some of the policy decisions that the Harris team is evaluating. Certainly, President Biden wanted to apply a tax to bitcoin mining as part of his budget. Part of this is they just don't understand the environmental benefit that bitcoin mining brings and the fact that it does not add additional fossil fuel requirements, it actually helps subsidize the renewable energy side of the world. And if they understood that, I think they would be willing to listen. But there are many forces rallied against us for political reasons on that side of the aisle that I wish didn't exist. Forbes: When did you start imprinting “made in the USA” in the blocks that you mine and why did you do that? Thiel: It was around the 4th of July [actual date was July 31]. It's a way for people to know if that block is mined in the U.S. or if it was mined offshore. Offshore entities control the majority of bitcoin pools. We're one of the few bitcoin pools that is not. We believe some people prefer transacting and putting their transactions into blocks that are mined in the U.S. Forbes: Are you ever worried that there could be a certain premium on bitcoins mined in the U.S. versus those elsewhere? Could that potentially impact the fungibility of any of these assets? Thiel: If you filter on OFAC, that doesn't impact the fungibility because you're not filtering bitcoins; you’re filtering wallets. How to look at it is somebody's bank account is on an OFAC list. The dollars in the bank account are on the list. It's the account, so the account can't transact. It's not that the bitcoin it holds is tainted. You may remember back in 2021, when we launched our pool, it originally had OFAC filtering turned on. Forbes: You’ve mentioned in the past that mining of Kaspa is a way to diversify. How much Kaspa do you have and are you continuing to mine it? Thiel: We continue to mine kaspa. We've grown our capacity a handful of times since we first announced that we were doing it. It's dissimilar from bitcoin in that it's a much smaller market cap and pool of liquidity. And so you can't just add exahashes and grow. You have to be very careful because there isn't a lot of liquidity compared to bitcoin. We mine enough so that we are not an overwhelming amount of the hashrate on the Kaspa network, but it is more profitable to mine than bitcoin on a per kilowatt hour basis. So if I invest a kilowatt of energy towards bitcoin, my profit using S21s could be anywhere from 5 to 8 cents depending on my cost of energy per kilowatt hour. In the case of kaspa, it's anywhere from 35 cents to a dollar. I can take kaspa, I can sell it and I can buy bitcoin or hold it. Kaspa has had some very strong price appreciation lately. So we've had a HODL strategy around some of the kaspa. Forbes: I published a list of what we called crypto billion dollar zombies in the magazine in March. Kaspa was mentioned as one of them. We saw the mining and we know it's similar to bitcoin, but it's hard to ascertain real discernible use for it beyond just people mining it and then sending it back and forth. Any more thoughts about Kaspa you'd like to share? Thiel: Kaspa as a technology is very interesting. It is a webchain versus a blockchain. It's web of blocks versus a linear line of blocks, and Kaspa has a very fast transaction speed. It also has a very high emissions decline. So it goes from emitting a lot of kaspa at the front end and then that subsidy drops very rapidly down. And so kaspa mining will likely not be a long-term business, but as long as we can mine it profitably and there's a good liquid market for it, then we just view it as a great source of revenues. Forbes: Is there anything I didn't ask you that’s at the top of your mind you'd like to share? Thiel: One thing that could be of interest to readers is that one of the primary drivers for the hashrate growth has been the upgrade cycle. If you take 30 watt per terrahash machines and replace them with 15 watt per terrahash machines, you just double your hashrate. Now that the upgrade cycle is finished, we’re entering a phase where people have to add actual capacity. I think you're still going to see global hashrate inching up, but you won't see the step function change that you saw. In 2023 hashrate doubled, then we had a halving in early 2024, and then you had all this hashrate come online [later]. We‘re pushing 700 exahash today. I think if anything, what you're going to see is bitcoin is going to continue to push sideways. We're seeing an institutionalization of bitcoin–ETFs have come on board; you now can do options on ETFs; you now have Morgan Stanley's 15,000 wealth advisors soliciting for bitcoin. We're still in the early days of this and you're now going to have hopefully the repeal or the reversal or the number of exemptions to SAB121, and you're going to see banks being able to custody bitcoin in addition to BNY Mellon, which means you can then start doing leverage, etc. You're going to build a lot of liquidity. With all those, what should be demand drivers? You still see institutional buyers sniping to buy bitcoin. They're sitting on the sidelines. They wait for a dip and they buy a dip. They are not in the market hurrying up, forcing the price up. So until there is a catalyst that drives the price of bitcoin up and maybe the election is the catalyst, I don't think we're going to see bitcoin price move up dramatically. Forbes: Thank you.

Title: Forget Tech Volatility: ‘Go Global’ With This Steady 8.1% Payer

Background of international currency notes. Closed-end funds (CEFs), with an average yield of around 8%, are terrific for just about any investor—especially those looking to their portfolios to help pay the bills. Heck, even if you’re not leaning on your CEFs for income, those big payouts are gold—you just reinvest them to boost your portfolio’s value and book an even bigger income stream going forward. But of course, not all CEFs are great investments, with some best avoided unless they trade at big discounts to net asset value, or NAV, the key indicator of value for these funds. And sometimes even a great fund isn’t the best one to buy, despite a big yield and an impressive record. That’s the situation with two CEFs that many income investors love: the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund (ETG) and Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK). Both have their merits, starting with their payouts: ETG yields 8.1% and STK pays a solid 5.6% as I write this. But in today’s market, one fund is clearly the better buy, and it’s all about what lies beneath those dividends. With that in mind, let’s stack these two solid funds up and see how they compare, starting with … ETG makes a splash early in our matchup with a portfolio that’s incredibly well-diversified, with exposure to sectors like financials, consumer staples, energy and, yes, the sector everyone’s talking about today: tech. The fund focuses on resilient large caps like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), pharma giant AstraZeneca SA and Nestle SA, the latter of which is best known for sweets in North America but makes a range of foods and ingredients you’ll find in just about any kitchen. As just those samples from the fund’s top-10 holdings list tell us, ETG also goes beyond the US, where we all know stocks have been on a tear lately, with a bit more than a third of its portfolio overseas. Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund 2Q2024 fact sheet This level of diversification gives ETG an edge because it spreads risk across the global economy, insulating the fund from the volatility of any single sector or from another big turn in the US stock market. And the roughly 12% of the portfolio in fixed-income investments (mainly investment-grade bonds) adds even more ballast. It helps support that big dividend, too. Now let’s switch over to STK, whose portfolio is in many ways the opposite: Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund June 30, 2024, fact sheet You can clearly see that almost all of the categories in the table above are tech-related. The fund’s top holdings read like a who’s who of the tech elite and include Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research Corp. (LRCX). These are all great companies, but when tech hits a rough patch, STK feels the brunt of it. NVIDIA’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is now over 70, highlights the risk here, reflecting how pricey some of these stocks are. When tech goes up, STK soars—but when tech stumbles, like it has recently, STK’s performance suffers. Then there’s the volatility. Don’t get me wrong. STK has performed strongly over the long term, with a five-year annualized return of 17.6%. But the flipside is clear: This is a high-risk, high-reward play. That’s not ideal for income-focused investors looking for steady, reliable payouts—especially when we look at the price you’ll pay for STK now. As I write this, ETG trades at a 10.4% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), so you can buy its portfolio for quite a bit less than it’s worth. This kind of deal is what we love to see in CEFs—it sets you up for upside and provides a margin of safety in case the market wobbles (since the fund is already cheap, it’s harder for it to get a lot cheaper). In contrast, STK trades at a slight premium to NAV. In other words, you’re paying more for a portfolio of tech stocks that’s already trading at higher prices. With the tech sector well-known for its volatility, paying a premium doesn’t make sense, especially when we can get ETG at a discount and lock in a higher yield at the same time. Over the past decade, ETG has proven itself as a steady performer, delivering a 9.1% annualized return. That’s impressive, especially for a diversified income fund that’s built to withstand the market’s ups and downs. ETG’s ability to provide consistent returns across various sectors gives it an edge when the market gets choppy. And choppiness is very much on the table after 2024’s outsized stock-market gains, especially in the tech sector. This also means STK is like a rollercoaster just at the top of a peak. Sure, its annualized return of 17.6% over the last five years looks fantastic on paper, but that’s largely because it’s been riding the wave of tech’s explosive growth. While STK has a portfolio perfect for those willing to ride the tech waves, ETG is simply the better buy for income investors now. Its 8.1% yield, combined with a double-digit discount to NAV and a diversified portfolio, make it a safer, more consistent play for those of us who prefer to sleep soundly at night while collecting reliable dividends.

Title: Vaginal Tritrichomonas foetus infection in mice as an in vivo model for drug development against Trichomonas vaginalis
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308672
Time Published: 2024-10-01T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of the common sexually transmitted disease, trichomoniasis, which affects more than a hundred million people worldwide. Metronidazole and tinidazole, agents belonging to the 5-nitroheterocyclic class of antimicrobials, are most often used to treat infection, but increased resistance has been reported and adverse effects of these drugs can be significant. Consequently, an urgent need exists for the development of novel drug entities against trichomoniasis. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Murine models of vaginal T. vaginalis infection are unreliable for unknown reasons. Meanwhile, murine infections with the related bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, tend to be more robust, although susceptibility to different antimicrobials might differ from T. vaginalis. Here, we explored the utility of T. foetus infection as a surrogate model for drug development against T. vaginalis. Four different T. foetus strains caused robust vaginal infection in young mice, while none of four diverse T. vaginalis strains did. Comparison of drug susceptibility profiles revealed that T. foetus and T. vaginalis were similarly susceptible to a range of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. By comparison, proteasome inhibitors were 10- to 15-fold less active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis, although one of the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, had low micromolar activity or better against multiple strains of both trichomonads. Different strains of T. foetus were used to demonstrate the utility of the murine vaginal infection models for in vivo efficacy testing, including for bortezomib and a gold(I) compound. The differences in susceptibility to proteasome inhibitors may be partially explained by differences in the proteasome subunit sequences between the two trichomonads, although the functional relevance of the proteasome was similar in both organisms. These findings indicate that T. foetus can serve as a reliable surrogate model for T. vaginalis in vitro and in murine infections in vivo, but caution must be exercised for specific drug classes with targets, such as the proteasome, that may display genetic divergence between the trichomonads.

Trichomoniasis, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common, non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the world with a global incidence of ~156 million, and a global prevalence of 5.4% [1]. The parasite can infect different genitourinary tissues, including the urethra, vagina, and cervix of women, and the prostate and urethra of men [2]. Infected women can experience a broad range of symptoms, including abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, and itching, vulvar or vaginal erythema, and colpitis macularis (“strawberry cervix”) [3]. Many women remain infected for extended periods [3]. Infection in men can lead to mild to moderate urethral discharge and urethral inflammation, but symptoms tend to be less severe than in women [1, 4]. The global prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is almost 10 times lower in men compared to women [1], which may reflect a lack of testing due to milder infection symptoms or could be related to an abbreviated course of infection. Nonetheless, lack of symptoms does not protect an individual from the complications associated with infection. For example, T. vaginalis infection can increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by 50% [5]. Furthermore, a positive correlation between HIV infection and trichomoniasis symptom severity was found in men [6]. In women, infection has also been linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer, low infant birth weight, preterm birth, and stillbirths [7, 8]. In men, a decrease in sperm viability and motility has been observed with the risk to decrease fertility [9]. To avoid potential complications, it is important to treat infection upon diagnosis, particularly since infection can last for months to years [10]. Metronidazole and tinidazole are two antimicrobials currently FDA-approved for the treatment of trichomoniasis [11]. They belong to the class of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs. Metronidazole, first developed in 1959, is the primary drug for trichomoniasis treatment worldwide [12]. Tinidazole, a structural derivative of metronidazole, was FDA-approved for trichomoniasis treatment in 2004 [11]. Both are prodrugs that must be reduced to a free radical inside microbial cells before they can covalently bind to multiple protein and nucleic acid targets. Adduct formation leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and many vital protein functions, eventually killing the organism. Both drugs primarily target anaerobic microorganisms, including T. vaginalis, as these organisms possess enzymatic pathways with low enough redox potential to donate electrons to the drug molecules [12]. For metronidazole, cure rates range from 86–97% [13–15]. Despite its general effectiveness, an estimated 2–10% of all clinical trichomoniasis cases are caused by strains that display resistance to metronidazole and other 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [16–18]. Beyond loss of efficacy due to resistance, metronidazole can have significant adverse effects that compromise its use and effectiveness. Thus, a large percentage of women treated with the drug have reported nausea, vomiting, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, headache, vaginal irritation, and yeast infections [19, 20]. Currently no other drug classes are FDA-approved to treat trichomoniasis. With the threat of growing resistance, and significant adverse effects, development of alternative antimicrobials in other drug classes remains urgent for treatment of trichomoniasis. Library screens of approved FDA drugs and drug candidates have been done to identify new activities against T. vaginalis but have not resulted in promising candidates [21]. De novo drug design against unexploited targets is currently the most realistic strategy for development of new antitrichomonal agents. One such strategy is exemplified by proteasome inhibitors [22]. The proteasome is an enzymatic complex present in all eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, whose function is to degrade and recycle proteins that are misfolded or not needed [23]. The enzyme complex consists of a barrel-like structure, consisting of two pairs of rings with seven α-subunits and seven β-subunits. Peptide substrates are fed through the center of the barrel where they are cleaved into smaller fragments. Three of the 14 proteasome subunits are catalytically active: β1 (caspase-like), β2 (trypsin-like), and β5 (chymotrypsin-like). Each cleaves the substrate at its preferred site via hydrolysis [24]. Proteasome inhibitors were first developed as anti-inflammatory agents and as novel agents for cancer treatment [25]. For example, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, was FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. More recently, proteasome inhibitors have also been found to be effective against Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan responsible for malaria [26]. Importantly, several new proteasome inhibitors were shown to be highly selective for the parasite over human cells [27]. T. vaginalis also possess a proteasome that can be targeted for the development of new agents against the parasite, since several proteasome inhibitors were active against the parasite in vitro and have selectivity over human cells [22]. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Ideally, animal models of infection can be used that employ the very same pathogens that infect humans. In the case of trichomoniasis, several reports have shown that mice can be infected vaginally with T. vaginalis [28–30], but infections tend to be tenuous and unreliable for poorly understood reasons. As an alternative, mouse infection models with surrogate trichomonad pathogens can be used if it can be shown that those infections are robust, and the pathogens respond to antimicrobial candidates in similar ways to the human target pathogen. For example, vaginal infection of mice with the bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, have been shown to cause sustained infection [28]. T. foetus is a protozoan parasite that causes tritrichomoniasis in cattle, a similar disease to human trichomoniasis. The parasite is closely related to T. vaginalis, being in the same phylum [31]. Despite its promise, the broader utility of this model for drug development against T. vaginalis remains to be established. Therefore, the aims of this study were to establish infectious characteristics in mice, similarities in in vitro drug responses, structural target similarities of a set of T. foetus strains in relation to T. vaginalis and establish the overall utility and limits of the murine T. foetus model as a basis for current and future drug development against T. vaginalis. T. foetus strains 003 (ATCC 30003), 166 (ATCC 30166), 232 (ATCC 30232), 924 (ATCC 30924), and T. vaginalis strain G3 (ATCC PRA-98) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T. vaginalis strains R88, MSA1172, S520 and S1489 were kindly provided by Dr. William Secor (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GA). T. foetus strain D1 and T. vaginalis strain F1623 were described in prior studies [32, 33]. Trichomonads were grown in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (Omega), 0.74% ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and adjusted to pH 6.2. Cultures were grown axenically at 37°C under anaerobic conditions. The following 5-nitro heterocyclic were purchased commercially (molecular masses in parentheses): Metronidazole (171 Da; Sigma-Aldrich), ronidazole (200 Da; APExBIO), tinidazole (247 Da; TCI America), nitazoxanide (307 Da; AdipoGen), and nithiamide (187 Da; MedChemExpress). The following gold(I) compounds (CPD), whose naming follows our prior usage [34], were also purchased: Auranofin (679 Da; Enzo Life Sciences), (Tri-n-ethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (351 Da, CPD4; Sigma-Aldrich), (Tri-n-methylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (309 Da, CPD10; Sigma-Aldrich) and myochrysine (390 Da; Sigma-Aldrich). The following gold(I) compounds were synthesized and characterized as described previously [34]: (Tri-n-propylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD11), (Triisopropylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD12), Bis(triethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (433 Da, CPD14), and Bis(tri-n-propylphosphine)gold (I) chloride (517 Da, CPD15). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (384 Da), ixazomib (361 Da) and carfilzomib (720 Da) were obtained from MedChemExpress. The benzimidazole compounds lansoprazole (369 Da), omeprazole (345 Da), albendazole (281 Da) and fenbendazole (299 Da) were also obtained from MedChemExpress. Pantoprazole (383 Da) was purchased from APExBIO and disulfiram (297 Da) from TCI America. BALB/cJ mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory) were bred in-house. Female mice were used within one week of weaning at 3–6 weeks of age. Groups of mice were housed in single plastic cages with free access to feed and water. The study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: S00205). Mice were handled with care, only by research staff fully trained in animal handling, at all times to minimize distress. Mouse health was monitored daily, as well as each time a sample was taken. Vaginal trichomonad infections in mice cause no pain, distress, or suffering, obviating any need for humane endpoints. Experimental endpoints were based solely on the infectious dynamics relative to the study objectives of assessing drug effects on infectious load. All animals were euthanized on the last day of sample collection by controlled CO2 inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Infections were performed with different strains of either T. vaginalis or T. foetus as indicated under the specific experiments in the figures. Trichomonads were cultured overnight, centrifuged, and resuspended at a density of 2 x 108 trophozoites/mL. For all in vitro and in vivo experiments, numbers of viable trophozoites were determined under a phase-contrast microscope. Viability was >95% as assessed by observation of the characteristic parasite motility. Five μL of the parasite suspension (containing 106 trophozoites) were slowly administered intravaginally to mice with a 20 μL micropipette. Mice were held briefly upside-down after agent administration to minimize leakage. In select experiments (as indicated in the figure legends), mice were pretreated one day before infection with one of following pretreatment regimens: a) 5 μL intravaginal administration of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate (Sigma-Aldrich); b) 100 μL intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate; c) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich); or d) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 μL i.p. injection of 1 mg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). The ammonium iron (III) citrate solution for intravaginal administration was made in PBS containing 1% hypromellose, while all formulation for i.p. injections were prepared in PBS. Control mice received no pretreatment. For drug efficacy tests in vivo, suspensions of bortezomib or gold (I) CPD4 were prepared at 10 mg/mL (= 1% w/v) in 0.2% hypromellose in PBS. Hypromellose solution without drugs was used as a control. Five μL of the drug suspensions (containing 0.05 mg of drug) were administered intravaginally as outlined above for the parasite inoculations. A total of five doses were administered: One dose on day 1 after infection, two doses each on days 2 and 3 after infection with 6–8 h between treatments on those days. Infectious load was determined 3–4 days after infection for all experiments except for a time course study with T. foetus strain 232, where mice were sampled on days 1, 3, 6, and 9. For assessment of infection, mice were lavaged intravaginally by slowly dispensing 30 μL of TYM medium into the vagina, taking it up again, and repeating the process two more times. The washes were diluted to 120 μL in TYM medium, and 10 μL of the diluted washes were placed into a hemocytometer for counting of motile trophozoites under a phase-contrast microscope. Infectious load is expressed as total number of trophozoites per mouse. For washes without countable trophozoites, the remaining volume was cultured in 2 mL of TYM medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for five days at 37°C, and regularly monitored for cell growth. Drug stocks were prepared as 10 mM solutions in DMSO. A 75 μM working stock was prepared in PBS and 1:3 serial dilutions were made in TYM medium in 96-well plates (post-dilution volume 40 μL/well). Parasite cultures were grown overnight in a 15 mL tube, centrifuged and resuspended to a density of 7 x 105–2 x 106 trophozoites/mL. Ten μL of this suspension were added into each well (final culture volume 50 μL/well), resulting in a final number of 7,000–20,000 trophozoites per well and final drug concentrations from 20 μM to 1 nM. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroPack; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical). Viable cell numbers were determined with a luciferase-based ATP assay (Promega) [35]. Luminescence was measured with the SpectraMax M2e plate reader, using the SoftMax Pro program (version 7.0.3). To assay the minimum lethal concentration (MLC), drugs were added to 96-well plates, and serially 2-fold diluted in TYM medium. Parasites were added to each well at a density of 7 x 105/mL (T. foetus D1) or 106 trophozoites/mL (T. vaginalis R88), resulting in a final number of 28,000 or 40,000 trophozoites per well, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions. Cultures (200 μL) were then transferred to medium-filled 15 mL tubes (representing a 1:75 dilution of the overnight culture to ensure adequate dilution of the drugs in those cultures) and kept at 37°C for a maximum of five days for observation of any cell growth indicative of survivors of the initial drug exposure. For sequence analysis of proteasome subunits, the genome and proteome sequences of the following parasite strains were used: T. foetus CC09-1 (GenBank AIF54491–504), T. vaginalis G3 (BioProject PRJNA938429, PRJNA16084) and P. falciparum NF54 (BioProject PRJNA422809), along with that of humans (BioProject PRJNA807723) and mice (BioProject PRJNA169). A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA software (version 11.0.13). Support values were calculated by bootstrapping with 100 replications. Protein sequences were aligned with the MUSCLE algorithm and an unrooted tree was constructed using the Le Gascuel model, with gamma distribution and invariant sites. Gaps were partially deleted, so that sites with missing data were only removed when necessary. Proteasome subunit designation followed the findings in [36]. For immunoblotting, T. foetus D1 and T. vaginalis F1623 cultures were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.3 μM or 3 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Lysates were made with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated with a primary rabbit anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat No. 10201-2-AP) at a 1:10,000 dilution overnight and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat No. 7074S) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 30 minutes. Proteins were detected with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). For labeling of catalytically active proteasome subunits with an activity-based probe, total cell lysates of T. foetus D1 or T. vaginalis F1623 were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.1–10 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Afterwards, 2 μM of the fluorescent proteasome probe, MV151 (R&D Systems, Cat No. I-190) [37] was added and lysates were further incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel, and bands were visualized by fluorescent imaging with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 530 nm. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 10.0.0). For compound activity screening, luminescence values were normalized against drug-free controls and plotted against the log drug concentration in each well to create a concentration-response curve for each drug. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), or concentration of drug needed to inhibit trophozoite growth and viability by 50%, and negative log10 of the IC50 (pIC50) were calculated. The assay sensitivity for pIC50 was set at 4.7, equivalent to the highest drug concentration tested in the assays. Each experiment was independently repeated three times per compound and per trichomonad strain. For in vitro data comparisons, parametric tests (ANOVA, t-tests) were used. For comparison of multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA was performed, and if a significant difference was found, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was applied to specific pairs. For in vivo data comparisons, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Previous studies had suggested that murine vaginal infections with T. vaginalis are characterized by low infectivity and/or short-lived infections, even with various manipulations of the host designed to increase susceptibility [28]. It is possible that marginal infectivity is related to the particular strains of T. vaginalis used for the infections, so we tested a range of four diverse strains of T. vaginalis for their ability to cause vaginal infection in young female mice. Three to four days after intravaginal inoculation, vaginal washes showed no detectable trophozoite counts for any of the tested strains (Fig 1A). Cultures of the washes for up to 5 days were uniformly negative, underlining that none of the T. vaginalis strains led to even low-level infection (Fig 1A). Furthermore, systemic (i.p.) or topical (vaginal) administration of iron, which improves T. vaginalis growth in culture [38], or systemic administration of estrogen alone or estrogen plus dexamethasone, which have been suggested to improve susceptibility of mice to T. vaginalis infection [28, 39], did not promote infectivity (Fig 1B). These experiments suggest that T. vaginalis could not infect mice under any of our current conditions, regardless of particular strains or conditioning regimens. Young (3–4 weeks) female BALB/cJ mice were intravaginally inoculated with the indicated strains of T. vaginalis (A, B) or T. foetus (C, D). In the experiments in panel B, mice were pretreated by vaginal instillation (topical) of iron or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of iron, estrogen, or estrogen and dexamethasone (dex) before infection, at dosages detailed in the Methods. Vaginal lavages were taken on day 3 or 4 of infection (A-C) or on the indicated days (D), and motile trophozoites were counted in a hemocytometer. Data points represent counts from individual mice, dashed lines indicate the detection threshold of the assays, and red diamonds show geometric means. For select samples without countable trophozoites, lavages were cultured in trichomonad growth medium with antibiotics (blue symbols). Positive cultures are indicated by solid blue dots, while negative cultures (no growth) are depicted by open blue dots.

Four different T. foetus strains were obtained and tested for their vaginal infectivity in young female mice. All four strains were able to cause infection without any pre-treatment with infectivity close to 100% (i.e., the percentage of mice with trophozoites detectable by direct counting or culture over total number of inoculated mice) (Fig 1C). To examine the time course of infection, we selected the T. foetus strain 232, which had the highest infectivity and/or highest trophozoite loads, and sampled mice every 2–3 days. All mice remained infected throughout the 9 days of the experiment, indicating a lack of spontaneous clearance during that period (Fig 1D). These findings demonstrate that T. foetus constitutes a more reliable murine model of vaginal trichomonad infection than T. vaginalis. To explore potential reasons for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis and T. foetus, we examined two parasite characteristics that may plausibly be involved: maximal growth rate and tolerance to different pH environments. The T. vaginalis strains had significantly slower growth rates in culture with longer doubling times compared to the T. foetus strains despite optimal growth conditions and media (Fig 2A). Furthermore, T. vaginalis growth was inhibited by even modestly alkaline pH in vitro, while T. foetus was able to grow mostly unhindered under these conditions (Fig 2B). These data indicate that the intrinsic properties of the two trichomonad species exhibit significant differences in regard to growth and pH tolerance. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium. (A) Cell numbers were counted before and after a 24-hour time incubation period and doubling times were calculated. Data are mean ± SE; *p<0.05 (unpaired t-test for all T. vaginalis strains vs. all T. foetus strains). (B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium. (A) Cell numbers were counted before and after a 24-hour time incubation period and doubling times were calculated. Data are mean ± SE; *p<0.05 (unpaired t-test for all T. vaginalis strains vs. all T. foetus strains). (B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g002 To test whether the differential pH sensitivity of the trichomonad strains might be responsible for their differential infectivity in vivo, we measured the vaginal pH in 3–6 week old mice before and after treatment with estrogen alone or with estrogen and dexamethasone [28]. Mean vaginal pH was 6.21 ± 0.04 in the untreated group (mean ± SE, n = 7 mice), 6.49 ± 0.09 for the estrogen-treated group (n = 7), and 6.71 ± 0.05 for the mice treated with estrogen and dexamethasone (n = 9). A Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test showed significance between the estrogen and dexamethasone versus the no treatment group. However, these data show that the vaginal pH was below 7.0 in all groups, thereby excluding differential pH tolerance as a possible explanation for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis vs T. foetus. To compare susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs between the two trichomonad species, we screened different strains against four major drug classes that are clinically used in trichomoniasis or have been shown to have significant in vitro activity against T. vaginalis: 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [41], gold(I) compounds [34], proteasome inhibitors [22], and benzimidazoles [21]. The most consistently active compounds were 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds and gold(I) compounds (S1 Table). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors had excellent activity against the T. vaginalis strains but were significantly less potent against the T. foetus strains (S1 Table). The benzimidazoles and another compound with reported in vitro activity against T. vaginalis, disulfiram [21], had only minimal or no activity against either T. foetus or T. vaginalis (S1 Table). Comparison of specific drugs within the three major drug classes with the greatest potencies revealed that all tested drugs were less active in T. foetus, although differences were observed between the drug classes (Fig 3). 5-Nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) drugs displayed, on average, a ~3-fold lower activity (mean ΔpIC50 = 0.47–0.48) in the T. foetus strains compared to the T. vaginalis strains, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig 3). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors were ~14-fold less active (mean ΔpIC50 = 1.15) against T. foetus relative to T. vaginalis, which was statistically significant (Fig 3). Activity (pIC50) of the indicated compounds from each of the indicated three drug classes against multiple strains of T. foetus and T. vaginalis was determined by 24 h growth and survival assay (the detailed data are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents the mean pIC50 of four (T. foetus) or three (T. vaginalis) different strains for the drugs listed below each graph. ΔpIC50 was calculated for each drug class by subtracting the mean T. foetus pIC50s from the mean T. vaginalis pIC50s. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01). Activity (pIC50) of the indicated compounds from each of the indicated three drug classes against multiple strains of T. foetus and T. vaginalis was determined by 24 h growth and survival assay (the detailed data are provided in S1 Table).

Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g003 Pairwise comparisons of strains were conducted to discover whether any individual T. foetus strain had similar drug susceptibility profiles to any of the T. vaginalis strains. Strong positive correlations were seen among the different T. foetus strains for all three major drug classes (Fig 4A, Table 1). In contrast, only modest average correlations were observed between strains of T. foetus vs. T. vaginalis (Table 1), which particularly affected the proteasome inhibitors and gold(I) compounds (Fig 4B). This might be partially explained by the only modest average correlations of drug susceptibilities among the different T. vaginalis strains (Table 1). In particular, the T. vaginalis strain S1489 displayed a very different drug susceptibility profile than the other T. vaginalis strains (Fig 4C, Table 1), thereby markedly skewing the correlation data for both T. vaginalis and T. foetus (Table 1). The graphs show correlations of the pIC50 values for individual drugs between the indicated pairs of trichomonad strains (the detailed data on drug activities used for these analyses are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents one drug and is color-coded by drug class. Plots are shown with a linear regression line (black) and line of identity (dotted red). The graphs show correlations of the pIC50 values for individual drugs between the indicated pairs of trichomonad strains (the detailed data on drug activities used for these analyses are provided in S1 Table).

To further characterize antimicrobial drug activity in the two trichomonad species, we determined MLCs by culturing cells for 24 hours in the presence of titrated drug concentrations, diluting the cultures 75-fold (to minimize the impact of residual drugs), and testing for survivors by outgrowth over the ensuing 5 days. The MLCs for metronidazole as a representative 5-nitroheterocyclic compound, and auranofin as a representative gold(I) compound, were very similar for T. foetus or T. vaginalis, reflecting the trends of the respective IC50 findings (Table 2). MLCs were generally 3- to 10-fold higher than IC50, consistent with the notion that complete parasite killing requires higher drug concentrations than growth inhibition by 50%. In contrast, MLC values could not be determined for the two tested proteasome inhibitors, even when tests were done with >100-fold higher drug concentrations than IC50 (Table 2). Even higher drug concentrations could not be tested in the MLC assays due to toxicity of the solvent DMSO. These results confirm that the antimicrobial activities of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds are not significantly different between the two trichomonad species. The data also show that the tested proteasome inhibitors are unlikely to be trichomonacidal for either T. foetus or T. vaginalis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.t002 To determine the utility of the new T. foetus vaginal infection models for drug efficacy testing, and to evaluate whether selected drugs are efficacious in vivo, we tested two representative compounds with excellent in vitro activity, the gold(I) compound, CPD4, and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, using two different T. foetus strains. Mice infected with T. foetus 232 were topically treated five times over three days with CPD4 and the infectious load was determined on day 4 (Fig 5A). None of the CPD4-treated mice had countable trophozoites, while ~70% of control mice were infected with an average of ~103 trophozoites per mouse (Fig 5B). Similarly, mice infected with the T. foetus strain D1 and treated with bortezomib showed no countable trophozoites, while all of the control mice had detectable infection (Fig 5C). These results demonstrate that the murine vaginal infection models are not only effective with different T. foetus strains, but are suitable for efficacy testing of new drug candidates against trichomonads. The results also reinforce the fact that CPD4 and bortezomib can clear T. foetus infection in an in vivo model. (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection. (B/C) Mice were infected with the indicated T. foetus strains and treated intravaginally with 0.05 mg/dose (5 μL of a 10 mg/mL suspension) of either the gold(I) compound CPD4 (B) or bortezomib (C), or were left untreated as controls. After 4 days, trophozoite numbers were determined. Each point represents an individual mouse. Dashed black lines represent the detection threshold. Red lines represent geometric means.

This discrepancy raised the question whether the T. foetus proteasome is substantially different from that of T. vaginalis. Analysis of the T. foetus genome identified all 14 proteasome subunits, seven α subunits (α1–7) and seven β subunits (β1–7), as expected for all eukaryotes (Fig 6). Sequence comparison of the subunits showed good homology (50–87% amino acid identity) with T. vaginalis, but much less homology (31–57%) with the human and murine counterparts, or even the protozoan parasite P. falciparum (Fig 6). By comparison, the human and murine proteasome subunits are more closely related to each other than the T. foetus subunits are to T. vaginalis. These findings indicate that structural differences exist between the T. foetus and T. vaginalis proteasome subunits, potentially offering an explanation for the differential activity of the tested proteasome inhibitors against the two trichomonad species.

For both trichomonads, bortezomib caused concentration-dependent increases in the abundance of ubiquitin-labeled proteins (Fig 7A). Furthermore, we used an activity-based probe, MV151 [37] for labeling of the catalytic proteasome subunits of the parasites. For T. foetus, labeling of β1 and β5 was strongly inhibited by bortezomib, while β2 labeling was only minimally affected at the highest concentrations (Fig 7B). By comparison, for T. vaginalis, inhibition was most prominent for the β1 subunit followed by β5 and, to a lesser degree, β2 (Fig 7B). Together, these findings show that bortezomib inhibits the proteasome in both T. foetus and T. vaginalis, most likely by targeting the same catalytic subunits. (A) The depicted trichomonad strains were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated final concentrations of bortezomib or left without inhibitor (0 μM). Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (left panels). As expected, multiple proteins of different sizes are labeled with ubiquitin, leading to the apparent “smear” on the blots. Total protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (right panels). (B) Total cell lysates of T. foetus and T. vaginalis were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated concentrations of bortezomib and subsequently labeled for 2 hour with the fluorescent activity-based proteasome probe, MV151. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorescent imaging. The band labeled with an asterisk corresponds to a non-specific target of MV151 that could not be competed for with any available proteasome inhibitor and is thus unlikely to be a proteasome subunit.

Robust infections with the relevant pathogens for a sufficiently long duration are key features of a good model. For trichomoniasis, infection of amenable animals, particularly rodents such as mice, with the causative pathogen, T. vaginalis, would be desirable, but we found here that murine vaginal infections with any of four T. vaginalis strains did not lead to detectable infection. In contrast, different strains of another trichomonad, T. foetus, were found to reliably infect mice for at least one week. These findings indicate that vaginal T. foetus infections provide a robust murine model suitable for in vivo drug testing. The striking difference in infectivity between T. vaginalis and T. foetus is unlikely to be related to particular strains of the respective pathogen, since the findings were consistent for four diverse strains of each species. General characteristics of the two trichomonad species are probably more important. For example, we found a difference in doubling time and pH tolerance between the two trichomonad species. Faster growth rates of T. foetus might promote infectivity by counteracting inevitable vaginal losses, while the slower growth of T. vaginalis may not be sufficient to make up for such losses. Consistent with this notion, highly infectious organisms tend to have faster doubling times due to optimization of codon usage bias and increased copies of rRNA and tRNA [42]. Another potential explanation for differential infectivity could be differences in pH tolerance. The murine vagina, unlike the normally acidic environment of the human vagina, has a pH close to neutral or even slightly alkaline [43]. The ability of T. foetus to grow under alkaline pH conditions may promote vaginal infection, while in vitro growth of T. vaginalis was strongly inhibited by alkaline pH and may thus also be compromised in vivo in mice, although our measurements that the murine vaginal pH ranged from 6.5–7 would not suggest that differential pH tolerance can explain differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. foetus vs T. vaginalis. Other possible explanations are conceivable for differential infectivity. For example, the estrus cycle of mice is characterized by periodic influx of leukocytes [44]. T. foetus may be more resistant to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes compared to T. vaginalis [28]. While the presence of vaginal leukocytes has no apparent impact on infectivity for T. foetus, it has been shown to have a negative impact on T. vaginalis infection [28]. Furthermore, the vaginal microbiota may be differentially affected by trichomonad infection and may impact the interactions of different trichomonads with the host. For example, T. vaginalis infection reduces vaginal epithelia-associated Lactobacillus species in humans [45]. In cats, T. foetus infection significantly impacts the abundance of a variety of different phyla present in the fecal microbiota [46]. Perhaps the extent and manner of microbial changes and their impact on host susceptibility to infection in mice may be more conducive to vaginal T. foetus infection. Other studies had some success with vaginal infection of mice with T. vaginalis, although rates of infection were generally low and variable [28–30]. Beyond specific mechanistic explanations for this variable infectivity, it is conceivable that differential infectivity may be related to the host ranges of the two trichomonads. T. vaginalis is strictly a human parasite [47], while T. foetus can infect cows, cats, and pigs [48]. The apparently narrow host range of T. vaginalis may indicate a requirement for particular host features that are not present in other species, while the broader host range of T. foetus may indicate that infection depends less on particular host characteristics. It is also important to note that none of the prior work, contrary to our present study, had assessed infection by direct trichomonad counts but relied on cultures of vaginal washes. It is possible that cell numbers were too low for counting but sufficient for obtaining positive cultures, which are likely to be one or two logs more sensitive than counts. It is also possible that different conditioning or pretreatment protocols, such as multiple subcutaneous estradiol injections, or co-infection with lactobacilli could have sensitized mice to vaginal T. vaginalis infection beyond what we employed in the current work [28–30]. Finally, although we tested four different stains, differences in T. vaginalis strains could still matter for murine infectivity, so it remains possible that a heretofore untested strain can, in fact, infect mice robustly. For a microorganism to be a useful surrogate model for drug development against a related but different infectious agent, both must have similar responses to the drugs of interest. We observed such congruency in the drug susceptibility of T. foetus and T. vaginalis to 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) compounds. Both drug classes are thought to act on a broad range of targets [49, 50]. In the case of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs, the prodrug forms are first reductively activated, then form covalent adducts on multiple target molecules, including different proteins as well as nucleic acids [51]. The molecular targets responsible for cytocidal activity of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs have not been defined, but it is likely that inactivation of multiple targets has synergistic effects that irreversibly damage the target cells [49]. The mechanism of action of gold(I) compounds is not well understood but also involve adduct formation and likely inactivation of multiple targets [50]. The multiplicity of cellular targets for both drug classes can provide an explanation for their similar activities against T. foetus and T. vaginalis, since even differences in the sequence or structure of any particular target are unlikely to interfere with the overall effectiveness of these drugs. It must be noted, however, that while not statistically significant, T. foetus had generally lower pIC50s for each compound of the two drug classes in the in vitro screening assays, which was also observed in prior studies with fewer compounds [22, 40]. Another explanation for differential drug susceptibility could be differential membrane permeability between the two parasites [52], which may allow for increased passive diffusion of small molecules, including potentially the tested antimicrobial drugs whose molecular masses are <800 Da, and thus greater susceptibility of T. vaginalis. Notably, we found little or no activity differences in the MLC assays, perhaps suggesting that the IC50 growth assays and MLC survival assays test slightly different drug properties or are differentially impacted by parasite characteristics not directly related to the drug action. For example, the IC50 assays could be affected by the faster growth rate of T. foetus over T. vaginalis. Drugs such as 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds that form covalent adducts may be consumed during the culture period, so a faster growing organism may deplete drugs more rapidly, thereby requiring apparently higher IC50 values to achieve 50% maximal growth inhibition. By comparison, MLC assays measure the ability of a drug to kill all target organisms, which typically requires higher drug levels, so the impact of drug consumption would be less apparent. Nonetheless, both IC50 and MLC provide valuable information for comparative assessment of the drug impact of T. foetus and T. vaginalis, and clearly show that the drug susceptibility of T. foetus closely resembles T. vaginalis in regard to 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. Consequently, our demonstration of in vivo efficacy for one of the gold(I) compounds is promising for its ultimate in vivo efficacy against T. vaginalis. Contrary to the 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds, we observed marked differences in the activity of proteasome inhibitors against T. foetus and T. vaginalis. Thus, T. foetus had significantly lower pIC50s for all tested drugs in this class compared to T. vaginalis. The target of these compounds is well defined and involves one or several of the three catalytic subunits of the proteasome [53, 54]. Differences in the sequence or fine structure of the relevant proteasome subunits between the two trichomonad species, which clearly exist based on our phylogenetic analysis, can probably impact the binding of specific inhibitors. In this context, it is important to note that the tested inhibitors were originally developed against the human proteasome [55] but not specifically selected for activity against either T. vaginalis or T. foetus. Screening of large proteasome inhibitor libraries may well identify compounds that are equally active against both trichomonads. It is therefore possible, that inhibitors could be found that are more active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis and even human cells, which could represent a promising starting point for new veterinary drugs against bovine tritrichomoniasis [56]. Nevertheless, based on the phylogenetic and functional analyses, we were able to conclude that no fundamental differences exist in the 20S proteasomes of T. foetus and T. vaginalis. We could also demonstrate that one proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has low micromolar or better activity against both T. foetus and T. vaginalis and can eliminate T. foetus infection in vivo, underlining that drug candidates with adequate activity against T. foetus can be active in vivo even if their relative potency in T. foetus does not closely mimic the findings in T. vaginalis. While this study focused on female mice, it is also important to acknowledge that males are carriers of T. vaginalis and at times may suffer symptoms. Male animal models of T. vaginalis infection via urethral injection and anesthesia have been established in mice [47] and rats [57]. In future studies, it would be of interest to evaluate drug efficacy in these models for potential treatment of male trichomoniasis. In summary, the T. foetus murine infection models described here have excellent utility as surrogate in vivo models for drug development campaigns for new drugs against T. vaginalis, particularly if multiple molecular drug targets are predicted. Caution should be exercised, however, for compounds with singular targets if those targets differ significantly between the two trichomonad species. In such situations, it would be advisable to conduct careful in vitro compound testing beforehand to confirm that drug activity is not significantly different between the two organisms or at last remains sufficiently high in T. foetus that in vivo efficacy testing is not likely to yield false negative results. T. foetus and T. vaginalis cultures were incubated for 24 hours with a range of drug concentrations, ATP content was assayed as a measure of cell growth and viability, and pIC50 values were calculated from the resulting concentration-response curves. Data are shown as mean ± SE of three or more independent experiments. IC50 values were derived from the mean pIC50. The highest tested drug concentration was 20 μM, so lack of growth inhibition at that concentration is listed as IC50 >20 μM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s002 (PDF) BMH was supported in part by the UCSD Graduate Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology.

Full Content:
Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of the common sexually transmitted disease, trichomoniasis, which affects more than a hundred million people worldwide. Metronidazole and tinidazole, agents belonging to the 5-nitroheterocyclic class of antimicrobials, are most often used to treat infection, but increased resistance has been reported and adverse effects of these drugs can be significant. Consequently, an urgent need exists for the development of novel drug entities against trichomoniasis. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Murine models of vaginal T. vaginalis infection are unreliable for unknown reasons. Meanwhile, murine infections with the related bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, tend to be more robust, although susceptibility to different antimicrobials might differ from T. vaginalis. Here, we explored the utility of T. foetus infection as a surrogate model for drug development against T. vaginalis. Four different T. foetus strains caused robust vaginal infection in young mice, while none of four diverse T. vaginalis strains did. Comparison of drug susceptibility profiles revealed that T. foetus and T. vaginalis were similarly susceptible to a range of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. By comparison, proteasome inhibitors were 10- to 15-fold less active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis, although one of the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, had low micromolar activity or better against multiple strains of both trichomonads. Different strains of T. foetus were used to demonstrate the utility of the murine vaginal infection models for in vivo efficacy testing, including for bortezomib and a gold(I) compound. The differences in susceptibility to proteasome inhibitors may be partially explained by differences in the proteasome subunit sequences between the two trichomonads, although the functional relevance of the proteasome was similar in both organisms. These findings indicate that T. foetus can serve as a reliable surrogate model for T. vaginalis in vitro and in murine infections in vivo, but caution must be exercised for specific drug classes with targets, such as the proteasome, that may display genetic divergence between the trichomonads.

Trichomoniasis, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common, non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the world with a global incidence of ~156 million, and a global prevalence of 5.4% [1]. The parasite can infect different genitourinary tissues, including the urethra, vagina, and cervix of women, and the prostate and urethra of men [2]. Infected women can experience a broad range of symptoms, including abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, and itching, vulvar or vaginal erythema, and colpitis macularis (“strawberry cervix”) [3]. Many women remain infected for extended periods [3]. Infection in men can lead to mild to moderate urethral discharge and urethral inflammation, but symptoms tend to be less severe than in women [1, 4]. The global prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is almost 10 times lower in men compared to women [1], which may reflect a lack of testing due to milder infection symptoms or could be related to an abbreviated course of infection. Nonetheless, lack of symptoms does not protect an individual from the complications associated with infection. For example, T. vaginalis infection can increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by 50% [5]. Furthermore, a positive correlation between HIV infection and trichomoniasis symptom severity was found in men [6]. In women, infection has also been linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer, low infant birth weight, preterm birth, and stillbirths [7, 8]. In men, a decrease in sperm viability and motility has been observed with the risk to decrease fertility [9]. To avoid potential complications, it is important to treat infection upon diagnosis, particularly since infection can last for months to years [10]. Metronidazole and tinidazole are two antimicrobials currently FDA-approved for the treatment of trichomoniasis [11]. They belong to the class of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs. Metronidazole, first developed in 1959, is the primary drug for trichomoniasis treatment worldwide [12]. Tinidazole, a structural derivative of metronidazole, was FDA-approved for trichomoniasis treatment in 2004 [11]. Both are prodrugs that must be reduced to a free radical inside microbial cells before they can covalently bind to multiple protein and nucleic acid targets. Adduct formation leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and many vital protein functions, eventually killing the organism. Both drugs primarily target anaerobic microorganisms, including T. vaginalis, as these organisms possess enzymatic pathways with low enough redox potential to donate electrons to the drug molecules [12]. For metronidazole, cure rates range from 86–97% [13–15]. Despite its general effectiveness, an estimated 2–10% of all clinical trichomoniasis cases are caused by strains that display resistance to metronidazole and other 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [16–18]. Beyond loss of efficacy due to resistance, metronidazole can have significant adverse effects that compromise its use and effectiveness. Thus, a large percentage of women treated with the drug have reported nausea, vomiting, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, headache, vaginal irritation, and yeast infections [19, 20]. Currently no other drug classes are FDA-approved to treat trichomoniasis. With the threat of growing resistance, and significant adverse effects, development of alternative antimicrobials in other drug classes remains urgent for treatment of trichomoniasis. Library screens of approved FDA drugs and drug candidates have been done to identify new activities against T. vaginalis but have not resulted in promising candidates [21]. De novo drug design against unexploited targets is currently the most realistic strategy for development of new antitrichomonal agents. One such strategy is exemplified by proteasome inhibitors [22]. The proteasome is an enzymatic complex present in all eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, whose function is to degrade and recycle proteins that are misfolded or not needed [23]. The enzyme complex consists of a barrel-like structure, consisting of two pairs of rings with seven α-subunits and seven β-subunits. Peptide substrates are fed through the center of the barrel where they are cleaved into smaller fragments. Three of the 14 proteasome subunits are catalytically active: β1 (caspase-like), β2 (trypsin-like), and β5 (chymotrypsin-like). Each cleaves the substrate at its preferred site via hydrolysis [24]. Proteasome inhibitors were first developed as anti-inflammatory agents and as novel agents for cancer treatment [25]. For example, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, was FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. More recently, proteasome inhibitors have also been found to be effective against Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan responsible for malaria [26]. Importantly, several new proteasome inhibitors were shown to be highly selective for the parasite over human cells [27]. T. vaginalis also possess a proteasome that can be targeted for the development of new agents against the parasite, since several proteasome inhibitors were active against the parasite in vitro and have selectivity over human cells [22]. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Ideally, animal models of infection can be used that employ the very same pathogens that infect humans. In the case of trichomoniasis, several reports have shown that mice can be infected vaginally with T. vaginalis [28–30], but infections tend to be tenuous and unreliable for poorly understood reasons. As an alternative, mouse infection models with surrogate trichomonad pathogens can be used if it can be shown that those infections are robust, and the pathogens respond to antimicrobial candidates in similar ways to the human target pathogen. For example, vaginal infection of mice with the bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, have been shown to cause sustained infection [28]. T. foetus is a protozoan parasite that causes tritrichomoniasis in cattle, a similar disease to human trichomoniasis. The parasite is closely related to T. vaginalis, being in the same phylum [31]. Despite its promise, the broader utility of this model for drug development against T. vaginalis remains to be established. Therefore, the aims of this study were to establish infectious characteristics in mice, similarities in in vitro drug responses, structural target similarities of a set of T. foetus strains in relation to T. vaginalis and establish the overall utility and limits of the murine T. foetus model as a basis for current and future drug development against T. vaginalis. T. foetus strains 003 (ATCC 30003), 166 (ATCC 30166), 232 (ATCC 30232), 924 (ATCC 30924), and T. vaginalis strain G3 (ATCC PRA-98) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T. vaginalis strains R88, MSA1172, S520 and S1489 were kindly provided by Dr. William Secor (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GA). T. foetus strain D1 and T. vaginalis strain F1623 were described in prior studies [32, 33]. Trichomonads were grown in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (Omega), 0.74% ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and adjusted to pH 6.2. Cultures were grown axenically at 37°C under anaerobic conditions. The following 5-nitro heterocyclic were purchased commercially (molecular masses in parentheses): Metronidazole (171 Da; Sigma-Aldrich), ronidazole (200 Da; APExBIO), tinidazole (247 Da; TCI America), nitazoxanide (307 Da; AdipoGen), and nithiamide (187 Da; MedChemExpress). The following gold(I) compounds (CPD), whose naming follows our prior usage [34], were also purchased: Auranofin (679 Da; Enzo Life Sciences), (Tri-n-ethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (351 Da, CPD4; Sigma-Aldrich), (Tri-n-methylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (309 Da, CPD10; Sigma-Aldrich) and myochrysine (390 Da; Sigma-Aldrich). The following gold(I) compounds were synthesized and characterized as described previously [34]: (Tri-n-propylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD11), (Triisopropylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD12), Bis(triethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (433 Da, CPD14), and Bis(tri-n-propylphosphine)gold (I) chloride (517 Da, CPD15). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (384 Da), ixazomib (361 Da) and carfilzomib (720 Da) were obtained from MedChemExpress. The benzimidazole compounds lansoprazole (369 Da), omeprazole (345 Da), albendazole (281 Da) and fenbendazole (299 Da) were also obtained from MedChemExpress. Pantoprazole (383 Da) was purchased from APExBIO and disulfiram (297 Da) from TCI America. BALB/cJ mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory) were bred in-house. Female mice were used within one week of weaning at 3–6 weeks of age. Groups of mice were housed in single plastic cages with free access to feed and water. The study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: S00205). Mice were handled with care, only by research staff fully trained in animal handling, at all times to minimize distress. Mouse health was monitored daily, as well as each time a sample was taken. Vaginal trichomonad infections in mice cause no pain, distress, or suffering, obviating any need for humane endpoints. Experimental endpoints were based solely on the infectious dynamics relative to the study objectives of assessing drug effects on infectious load. All animals were euthanized on the last day of sample collection by controlled CO2 inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Infections were performed with different strains of either T. vaginalis or T. foetus as indicated under the specific experiments in the figures. Trichomonads were cultured overnight, centrifuged, and resuspended at a density of 2 x 108 trophozoites/mL. For all in vitro and in vivo experiments, numbers of viable trophozoites were determined under a phase-contrast microscope. Viability was >95% as assessed by observation of the characteristic parasite motility. Five μL of the parasite suspension (containing 106 trophozoites) were slowly administered intravaginally to mice with a 20 μL micropipette. Mice were held briefly upside-down after agent administration to minimize leakage. In select experiments (as indicated in the figure legends), mice were pretreated one day before infection with one of following pretreatment regimens: a) 5 μL intravaginal administration of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate (Sigma-Aldrich); b) 100 μL intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate; c) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich); or d) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 μL i.p. injection of 1 mg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). The ammonium iron (III) citrate solution for intravaginal administration was made in PBS containing 1% hypromellose, while all formulation for i.p. injections were prepared in PBS. Control mice received no pretreatment. For drug efficacy tests in vivo, suspensions of bortezomib or gold (I) CPD4 were prepared at 10 mg/mL (= 1% w/v) in 0.2% hypromellose in PBS. Hypromellose solution without drugs was used as a control. Five μL of the drug suspensions (containing 0.05 mg of drug) were administered intravaginally as outlined above for the parasite inoculations. A total of five doses were administered: One dose on day 1 after infection, two doses each on days 2 and 3 after infection with 6–8 h between treatments on those days. Infectious load was determined 3–4 days after infection for all experiments except for a time course study with T. foetus strain 232, where mice were sampled on days 1, 3, 6, and 9. For assessment of infection, mice were lavaged intravaginally by slowly dispensing 30 μL of TYM medium into the vagina, taking it up again, and repeating the process two more times. The washes were diluted to 120 μL in TYM medium, and 10 μL of the diluted washes were placed into a hemocytometer for counting of motile trophozoites under a phase-contrast microscope. Infectious load is expressed as total number of trophozoites per mouse. For washes without countable trophozoites, the remaining volume was cultured in 2 mL of TYM medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for five days at 37°C, and regularly monitored for cell growth. Drug stocks were prepared as 10 mM solutions in DMSO. A 75 μM working stock was prepared in PBS and 1:3 serial dilutions were made in TYM medium in 96-well plates (post-dilution volume 40 μL/well). Parasite cultures were grown overnight in a 15 mL tube, centrifuged and resuspended to a density of 7 x 105–2 x 106 trophozoites/mL. Ten μL of this suspension were added into each well (final culture volume 50 μL/well), resulting in a final number of 7,000–20,000 trophozoites per well and final drug concentrations from 20 μM to 1 nM. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroPack; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical). Viable cell numbers were determined with a luciferase-based ATP assay (Promega) [35]. Luminescence was measured with the SpectraMax M2e plate reader, using the SoftMax Pro program (version 7.0.3). To assay the minimum lethal concentration (MLC), drugs were added to 96-well plates, and serially 2-fold diluted in TYM medium. Parasites were added to each well at a density of 7 x 105/mL (T. foetus D1) or 106 trophozoites/mL (T. vaginalis R88), resulting in a final number of 28,000 or 40,000 trophozoites per well, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions. Cultures (200 μL) were then transferred to medium-filled 15 mL tubes (representing a 1:75 dilution of the overnight culture to ensure adequate dilution of the drugs in those cultures) and kept at 37°C for a maximum of five days for observation of any cell growth indicative of survivors of the initial drug exposure. For sequence analysis of proteasome subunits, the genome and proteome sequences of the following parasite strains were used: T. foetus CC09-1 (GenBank AIF54491–504), T. vaginalis G3 (BioProject PRJNA938429, PRJNA16084) and P. falciparum NF54 (BioProject PRJNA422809), along with that of humans (BioProject PRJNA807723) and mice (BioProject PRJNA169). A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA software (version 11.0.13). Support values were calculated by bootstrapping with 100 replications. Protein sequences were aligned with the MUSCLE algorithm and an unrooted tree was constructed using the Le Gascuel model, with gamma distribution and invariant sites. Gaps were partially deleted, so that sites with missing data were only removed when necessary. Proteasome subunit designation followed the findings in [36]. For immunoblotting, T. foetus D1 and T. vaginalis F1623 cultures were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.3 μM or 3 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Lysates were made with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated with a primary rabbit anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat No. 10201-2-AP) at a 1:10,000 dilution overnight and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat No. 7074S) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 30 minutes. Proteins were detected with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). For labeling of catalytically active proteasome subunits with an activity-based probe, total cell lysates of T. foetus D1 or T. vaginalis F1623 were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.1–10 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Afterwards, 2 μM of the fluorescent proteasome probe, MV151 (R&D Systems, Cat No. I-190) [37] was added and lysates were further incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel, and bands were visualized by fluorescent imaging with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 530 nm. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 10.0.0). For compound activity screening, luminescence values were normalized against drug-free controls and plotted against the log drug concentration in each well to create a concentration-response curve for each drug. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), or concentration of drug needed to inhibit trophozoite growth and viability by 50%, and negative log10 of the IC50 (pIC50) were calculated. The assay sensitivity for pIC50 was set at 4.7, equivalent to the highest drug concentration tested in the assays. Each experiment was independently repeated three times per compound and per trichomonad strain. For in vitro data comparisons, parametric tests (ANOVA, t-tests) were used. For comparison of multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA was performed, and if a significant difference was found, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was applied to specific pairs. For in vivo data comparisons, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Previous studies had suggested that murine vaginal infections with T. vaginalis are characterized by low infectivity and/or short-lived infections, even with various manipulations of the host designed to increase susceptibility [28]. It is possible that marginal infectivity is related to the particular strains of T. vaginalis used for the infections, so we tested a range of four diverse strains of T. vaginalis for their ability to cause vaginal infection in young female mice. Three to four days after intravaginal inoculation, vaginal washes showed no detectable trophozoite counts for any of the tested strains (Fig 1A). Cultures of the washes for up to 5 days were uniformly negative, underlining that none of the T. vaginalis strains led to even low-level infection (Fig 1A). Furthermore, systemic (i.p.) or topical (vaginal) administration of iron, which improves T. vaginalis growth in culture [38], or systemic administration of estrogen alone or estrogen plus dexamethasone, which have been suggested to improve susceptibility of mice to T. vaginalis infection [28, 39], did not promote infectivity (Fig 1B). These experiments suggest that T. vaginalis could not infect mice under any of our current conditions, regardless of particular strains or conditioning regimens. Young (3–4 weeks) female BALB/cJ mice were intravaginally inoculated with the indicated strains of T. vaginalis (A, B) or T. foetus (C, D). In the experiments in panel B, mice were pretreated by vaginal instillation (topical) of iron or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of iron, estrogen, or estrogen and dexamethasone (dex) before infection, at dosages detailed in the Methods. Vaginal lavages were taken on day 3 or 4 of infection (A-C) or on the indicated days (D), and motile trophozoites were counted in a hemocytometer. Data points represent counts from individual mice, dashed lines indicate the detection threshold of the assays, and red diamonds show geometric means. For select samples without countable trophozoites, lavages were cultured in trichomonad growth medium with antibiotics (blue symbols). Positive cultures are indicated by solid blue dots, while negative cultures (no growth) are depicted by open blue dots.

Four different T. foetus strains were obtained and tested for their vaginal infectivity in young female mice. All four strains were able to cause infection without any pre-treatment with infectivity close to 100% (i.e., the percentage of mice with trophozoites detectable by direct counting or culture over total number of inoculated mice) (Fig 1C). To examine the time course of infection, we selected the T. foetus strain 232, which had the highest infectivity and/or highest trophozoite loads, and sampled mice every 2–3 days. All mice remained infected throughout the 9 days of the experiment, indicating a lack of spontaneous clearance during that period (Fig 1D). These findings demonstrate that T. foetus constitutes a more reliable murine model of vaginal trichomonad infection than T. vaginalis. To explore potential reasons for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis and T. foetus, we examined two parasite characteristics that may plausibly be involved: maximal growth rate and tolerance to different pH environments. The T. vaginalis strains had significantly slower growth rates in culture with longer doubling times compared to the T. foetus strains despite optimal growth conditions and media (Fig 2A). Furthermore, T. vaginalis growth was inhibited by even modestly alkaline pH in vitro, while T. foetus was able to grow mostly unhindered under these conditions (Fig 2B). These data indicate that the intrinsic properties of the two trichomonad species exhibit significant differences in regard to growth and pH tolerance. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium. (A) Cell numbers were counted before and after a 24-hour time incubation period and doubling times were calculated. Data are mean ± SE; *p<0.05 (unpaired t-test for all T. vaginalis strains vs. all T. foetus strains). (B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE.

Data are mean ± SE. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g002 To test whether the differential pH sensitivity of the trichomonad strains might be responsible for their differential infectivity in vivo, we measured the vaginal pH in 3–6 week old mice before and after treatment with estrogen alone or with estrogen and dexamethasone [28]. Mean vaginal pH was 6.21 ± 0.04 in the untreated group (mean ± SE, n = 7 mice), 6.49 ± 0.09 for the estrogen-treated group (n = 7), and 6.71 ± 0.05 for the mice treated with estrogen and dexamethasone (n = 9). A Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test showed significance between the estrogen and dexamethasone versus the no treatment group. However, these data show that the vaginal pH was below 7.0 in all groups, thereby excluding differential pH tolerance as a possible explanation for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis vs T. foetus. To compare susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs between the two trichomonad species, we screened different strains against four major drug classes that are clinically used in trichomoniasis or have been shown to have significant in vitro activity against T. vaginalis: 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [41], gold(I) compounds [34], proteasome inhibitors [22], and benzimidazoles [21]. The most consistently active compounds were 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds and gold(I) compounds (S1 Table). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors had excellent activity against the T. vaginalis strains but were significantly less potent against the T. foetus strains (S1 Table). The benzimidazoles and another compound with reported in vitro activity against T. vaginalis, disulfiram [21], had only minimal or no activity against either T. foetus or T. vaginalis (S1 Table). Comparison of specific drugs within the three major drug classes with the greatest potencies revealed that all tested drugs were less active in T. foetus, although differences were observed between the drug classes (Fig 3). 5-Nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) drugs displayed, on average, a ~3-fold lower activity (mean ΔpIC50 = 0.47–0.48) in the T. foetus strains compared to the T. vaginalis strains, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig 3). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors were ~14-fold less active (mean ΔpIC50 = 1.15) against T. foetus relative to T. vaginalis, which was statistically significant (Fig 3). Activity (pIC50) of the indicated compounds from each of the indicated three drug classes against multiple strains of T. foetus and T. vaginalis was determined by 24 h growth and survival assay (the detailed data are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents the mean pIC50 of four (T. foetus) or three (T. vaginalis) different strains for the drugs listed below each graph. ΔpIC50 was calculated for each drug class by subtracting the mean T. foetus pIC50s from the mean T. vaginalis pIC50s. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01).

Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g003 Pairwise comparisons of strains were conducted to discover whether any individual T. foetus strain had similar drug susceptibility profiles to any of the T. vaginalis strains. Strong positive correlations were seen among the different T. foetus strains for all three major drug classes (Fig 4A, Table 1). In contrast, only modest average correlations were observed between strains of T. foetus vs. T. vaginalis (Table 1), which particularly affected the proteasome inhibitors and gold(I) compounds (Fig 4B). This might be partially explained by the only modest average correlations of drug susceptibilities among the different T. vaginalis strains (Table 1). In particular, the T. vaginalis strain S1489 displayed a very different drug susceptibility profile than the other T. vaginalis strains (Fig 4C, Table 1), thereby markedly skewing the correlation data for both T. vaginalis and T. foetus (Table 1). The graphs show correlations of the pIC50 values for individual drugs between the indicated pairs of trichomonad strains (the detailed data on drug activities used for these analyses are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents one drug and is color-coded by drug class. Plots are shown with a linear regression line (black) and line of identity (dotted red).

To further characterize antimicrobial drug activity in the two trichomonad species, we determined MLCs by culturing cells for 24 hours in the presence of titrated drug concentrations, diluting the cultures 75-fold (to minimize the impact of residual drugs), and testing for survivors by outgrowth over the ensuing 5 days. The MLCs for metronidazole as a representative 5-nitroheterocyclic compound, and auranofin as a representative gold(I) compound, were very similar for T. foetus or T. vaginalis, reflecting the trends of the respective IC50 findings (Table 2). MLCs were generally 3- to 10-fold higher than IC50, consistent with the notion that complete parasite killing requires higher drug concentrations than growth inhibition by 50%. In contrast, MLC values could not be determined for the two tested proteasome inhibitors, even when tests were done with >100-fold higher drug concentrations than IC50 (Table 2). Even higher drug concentrations could not be tested in the MLC assays due to toxicity of the solvent DMSO. These results confirm that the antimicrobial activities of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds are not significantly different between the two trichomonad species. The data also show that the tested proteasome inhibitors are unlikely to be trichomonacidal for either T. foetus or T. vaginalis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.t002 To determine the utility of the new T. foetus vaginal infection models for drug efficacy testing, and to evaluate whether selected drugs are efficacious in vivo, we tested two representative compounds with excellent in vitro activity, the gold(I) compound, CPD4, and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, using two different T. foetus strains. Mice infected with T. foetus 232 were topically treated five times over three days with CPD4 and the infectious load was determined on day 4 (Fig 5A). None of the CPD4-treated mice had countable trophozoites, while ~70% of control mice were infected with an average of ~103 trophozoites per mouse (Fig 5B). Similarly, mice infected with the T. foetus strain D1 and treated with bortezomib showed no countable trophozoites, while all of the control mice had detectable infection (Fig 5C). These results demonstrate that the murine vaginal infection models are not only effective with different T. foetus strains, but are suitable for efficacy testing of new drug candidates against trichomonads. The results also reinforce the fact that CPD4 and bortezomib can clear T. foetus infection in an in vivo model. (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection. (B/C) Mice were infected with the indicated T. foetus strains and treated intravaginally with 0.05 mg/dose (5 μL of a 10 mg/mL suspension) of either the gold(I) compound CPD4 (B) or bortezomib (C), or were left untreated as controls. After 4 days, trophozoite numbers were determined. Each point represents an individual mouse. Dashed black lines represent the detection threshold. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney test (*p <0.01). (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection.

This discrepancy raised the question whether the T. foetus proteasome is substantially different from that of T. vaginalis. Analysis of the T. foetus genome identified all 14 proteasome subunits, seven α subunits (α1–7) and seven β subunits (β1–7), as expected for all eukaryotes (Fig 6). Sequence comparison of the subunits showed good homology (50–87% amino acid identity) with T. vaginalis, but much less homology (31–57%) with the human and murine counterparts, or even the protozoan parasite P. falciparum (Fig 6). By comparison, the human and murine proteasome subunits are more closely related to each other than the T. foetus subunits are to T. vaginalis. These findings indicate that structural differences exist between the T. foetus and T. vaginalis proteasome subunits, potentially offering an explanation for the differential activity of the tested proteasome inhibitors against the two trichomonad species.

For both trichomonads, bortezomib caused concentration-dependent increases in the abundance of ubiquitin-labeled proteins (Fig 7A). Furthermore, we used an activity-based probe, MV151 [37] for labeling of the catalytic proteasome subunits of the parasites. For T. foetus, labeling of β1 and β5 was strongly inhibited by bortezomib, while β2 labeling was only minimally affected at the highest concentrations (Fig 7B). By comparison, for T. vaginalis, inhibition was most prominent for the β1 subunit followed by β5 and, to a lesser degree, β2 (Fig 7B). Together, these findings show that bortezomib inhibits the proteasome in both T. foetus and T. vaginalis, most likely by targeting the same catalytic subunits. (A) The depicted trichomonad strains were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated final concentrations of bortezomib or left without inhibitor (0 μM). Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (left panels). As expected, multiple proteins of different sizes are labeled with ubiquitin, leading to the apparent “smear” on the blots. Total protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (right panels). (B) Total cell lysates of T. foetus and T. vaginalis were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated concentrations of bortezomib and subsequently labeled for 2 hour with the fluorescent activity-based proteasome probe, MV151. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorescent imaging. The band labeled with an asterisk corresponds to a non-specific target of MV151 that could not be competed for with any available proteasome inhibitor and is thus unlikely to be a proteasome subunit. Raw images of the blots and gels are shown in S1 Raw images.

Robust infections with the relevant pathogens for a sufficiently long duration are key features of a good model. For trichomoniasis, infection of amenable animals, particularly rodents such as mice, with the causative pathogen, T. vaginalis, would be desirable, but we found here that murine vaginal infections with any of four T. vaginalis strains did not lead to detectable infection. In contrast, different strains of another trichomonad, T. foetus, were found to reliably infect mice for at least one week. These findings indicate that vaginal T. foetus infections provide a robust murine model suitable for in vivo drug testing. The striking difference in infectivity between T. vaginalis and T. foetus is unlikely to be related to particular strains of the respective pathogen, since the findings were consistent for four diverse strains of each species. General characteristics of the two trichomonad species are probably more important. For example, we found a difference in doubling time and pH tolerance between the two trichomonad species. Faster growth rates of T. foetus might promote infectivity by counteracting inevitable vaginal losses, while the slower growth of T. vaginalis may not be sufficient to make up for such losses. Consistent with this notion, highly infectious organisms tend to have faster doubling times due to optimization of codon usage bias and increased copies of rRNA and tRNA [42]. Another potential explanation for differential infectivity could be differences in pH tolerance. The murine vagina, unlike the normally acidic environment of the human vagina, has a pH close to neutral or even slightly alkaline [43]. The ability of T. foetus to grow under alkaline pH conditions may promote vaginal infection, while in vitro growth of T. vaginalis was strongly inhibited by alkaline pH and may thus also be compromised in vivo in mice, although our measurements that the murine vaginal pH ranged from 6.5–7 would not suggest that differential pH tolerance can explain differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. foetus vs T. vaginalis. Other possible explanations are conceivable for differential infectivity. For example, the estrus cycle of mice is characterized by periodic influx of leukocytes [44]. T. foetus may be more resistant to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes compared to T. vaginalis [28]. While the presence of vaginal leukocytes has no apparent impact on infectivity for T. foetus, it has been shown to have a negative impact on T. vaginalis infection [28]. Furthermore, the vaginal microbiota may be differentially affected by trichomonad infection and may impact the interactions of different trichomonads with the host. For example, T. vaginalis infection reduces vaginal epithelia-associated Lactobacillus species in humans [45]. In cats, T. foetus infection significantly impacts the abundance of a variety of different phyla present in the fecal microbiota [46]. Perhaps the extent and manner of microbial changes and their impact on host susceptibility to infection in mice may be more conducive to vaginal T. foetus infection. Other studies had some success with vaginal infection of mice with T. vaginalis, although rates of infection were generally low and variable [28–30]. Beyond specific mechanistic explanations for this variable infectivity, it is conceivable that differential infectivity may be related to the host ranges of the two trichomonads. T. vaginalis is strictly a human parasite [47], while T. foetus can infect cows, cats, and pigs [48]. The apparently narrow host range of T. vaginalis may indicate a requirement for particular host features that are not present in other species, while the broader host range of T. foetus may indicate that infection depends less on particular host characteristics. It is also important to note that none of the prior work, contrary to our present study, had assessed infection by direct trichomonad counts but relied on cultures of vaginal washes. It is possible that cell numbers were too low for counting but sufficient for obtaining positive cultures, which are likely to be one or two logs more sensitive than counts. It is also possible that different conditioning or pretreatment protocols, such as multiple subcutaneous estradiol injections, or co-infection with lactobacilli could have sensitized mice to vaginal T. vaginalis infection beyond what we employed in the current work [28–30]. Finally, although we tested four different stains, differences in T. vaginalis strains could still matter for murine infectivity, so it remains possible that a heretofore untested strain can, in fact, infect mice robustly. For a microorganism to be a useful surrogate model for drug development against a related but different infectious agent, both must have similar responses to the drugs of interest. We observed such congruency in the drug susceptibility of T. foetus and T. vaginalis to 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) compounds. Both drug classes are thought to act on a broad range of targets [49, 50]. In the case of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs, the prodrug forms are first reductively activated, then form covalent adducts on multiple target molecules, including different proteins as well as nucleic acids [51]. The molecular targets responsible for cytocidal activity of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs have not been defined, but it is likely that inactivation of multiple targets has synergistic effects that irreversibly damage the target cells [49]. The mechanism of action of gold(I) compounds is not well understood but also involve adduct formation and likely inactivation of multiple targets [50]. The multiplicity of cellular targets for both drug classes can provide an explanation for their similar activities against T. foetus and T. vaginalis, since even differences in the sequence or structure of any particular target are unlikely to interfere with the overall effectiveness of these drugs. It must be noted, however, that while not statistically significant, T. foetus had generally lower pIC50s for each compound of the two drug classes in the in vitro screening assays, which was also observed in prior studies with fewer compounds [22, 40]. Another explanation for differential drug susceptibility could be differential membrane permeability between the two parasites [52], which may allow for increased passive diffusion of small molecules, including potentially the tested antimicrobial drugs whose molecular masses are <800 Da, and thus greater susceptibility of T. vaginalis. Notably, we found little or no activity differences in the MLC assays, perhaps suggesting that the IC50 growth assays and MLC survival assays test slightly different drug properties or are differentially impacted by parasite characteristics not directly related to the drug action. For example, the IC50 assays could be affected by the faster growth rate of T. foetus over T. vaginalis. Drugs such as 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds that form covalent adducts may be consumed during the culture period, so a faster growing organism may deplete drugs more rapidly, thereby requiring apparently higher IC50 values to achieve 50% maximal growth inhibition. By comparison, MLC assays measure the ability of a drug to kill all target organisms, which typically requires higher drug levels, so the impact of drug consumption would be less apparent. Nonetheless, both IC50 and MLC provide valuable information for comparative assessment of the drug impact of T. foetus and T. vaginalis, and clearly show that the drug susceptibility of T. foetus closely resembles T. vaginalis in regard to 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. Consequently, our demonstration of in vivo efficacy for one of the gold(I) compounds is promising for its ultimate in vivo efficacy against T. vaginalis. Contrary to the 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds, we observed marked differences in the activity of proteasome inhibitors against T. foetus and T. vaginalis. Thus, T. foetus had significantly lower pIC50s for all tested drugs in this class compared to T. vaginalis. The target of these compounds is well defined and involves one or several of the three catalytic subunits of the proteasome [53, 54]. Differences in the sequence or fine structure of the relevant proteasome subunits between the two trichomonad species, which clearly exist based on our phylogenetic analysis, can probably impact the binding of specific inhibitors. In this context, it is important to note that the tested inhibitors were originally developed against the human proteasome [55] but not specifically selected for activity against either T. vaginalis or T. foetus. Screening of large proteasome inhibitor libraries may well identify compounds that are equally active against both trichomonads. It is therefore possible, that inhibitors could be found that are more active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis and even human cells, which could represent a promising starting point for new veterinary drugs against bovine tritrichomoniasis [56]. Nevertheless, based on the phylogenetic and functional analyses, we were able to conclude that no fundamental differences exist in the 20S proteasomes of T. foetus and T. vaginalis. We could also demonstrate that one proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has low micromolar or better activity against both T. foetus and T. vaginalis and can eliminate T. foetus infection in vivo, underlining that drug candidates with adequate activity against T. foetus can be active in vivo even if their relative potency in T. foetus does not closely mimic the findings in T. vaginalis. While this study focused on female mice, it is also important to acknowledge that males are carriers of T. vaginalis and at times may suffer symptoms. Male animal models of T. vaginalis infection via urethral injection and anesthesia have been established in mice [47] and rats [57]. In future studies, it would be of interest to evaluate drug efficacy in these models for potential treatment of male trichomoniasis. In summary, the T. foetus murine infection models described here have excellent utility as surrogate in vivo models for drug development campaigns for new drugs against T. vaginalis, particularly if multiple molecular drug targets are predicted. Caution should be exercised, however, for compounds with singular targets if those targets differ significantly between the two trichomonad species. In such situations, it would be advisable to conduct careful in vitro compound testing beforehand to confirm that drug activity is not significantly different between the two organisms or at last remains sufficiently high in T. foetus that in vivo efficacy testing is not likely to yield false negative results. T. foetus and T. vaginalis cultures were incubated for 24 hours with a range of drug concentrations, ATP content was assayed as a measure of cell growth and viability, and pIC50 values were calculated from the resulting concentration-response curves. Data are shown as mean ± SE of three or more independent experiments. IC50 values were derived from the mean pIC50. The highest tested drug concentration was 20 μM, so lack of growth inhibition at that concentration is listed as IC50 >20 μM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s002 (PDF) BMH was supported in part by the UCSD Graduate Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology.

India's push into semiconductors comes as more U.S. chipmakers set their sights on India. Nvidia, AMD, Micron are among the U.S. companies that have pledged to expand in the country. "I'm in touch with the Micron CEO regularly, and they are making good progress," Goyal said. Goyal added that Indian behemoth Tata and other domestic companies are working to make India's semiconductor dream a reality. It's unlikely India will manufacture the most cutting-edge chips without the expertise of companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung which build some of the world's most advanced chips. "It is a tough job, but we have the talent, we have the skills," said Goyal. The minister referenced a recent trip to Silicon Valley where he visited several U.S. semiconductor companies and "saw tons of Indians working on the shop floor [and] on management teams," recounts Goyal. The minister, spearheading U.S. corporation expansion efforts under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is confident India will be able to deliver the first chip by 2026-2027. Apple has already found success in India as it has looked to diversify its supply chain away from China. Goyal says 14% of the world's iPhones are manufactured in India, with that number "expected to grow." Apple increased assembly in the country in the last two years while boosting its retail presence to attract new iPhone buyers. And according to Goyal, Indian customers are increasingly opting for the more expensive iPhones. Apple has also begun manufacturing other products, including iPads, AirPods and Apple Watches in the country. "They're increasing production," Goyal added. Apple's expansion efforts in India have brought 150,000 jobs across manufacturing facilities in India, making it the biggest employer in the country's electronics industry, according to India's Commerce department. An Apple spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. Apple's foray into India comes amid ongoing growth challenges in China. On the recent bout of optimism around China's economic story and the latest stimulus measures, Goyal suggested that India's success is not predicated on China's troubles. "India… is not dependent on China. We stand on our own competencies, on our capabilities, and we believe we an offering that is far superior to China," said Goyal. Goyal met with a few Wall Street investors on Monday including executives from BlackRock, Warburg Pincus and KKR. Goyal said almost all the U.S. private equity players are looking to build and develop data centers across the country. Google, Microsoft and Nvidia are among the tech companies that are bringing artificial intelligence expertise to India, which Modi's government has been receptive to. But analysts warn that India must continue tackling larger issues including poor infrastructure, bureaucracy and red tape that have slowed down corporate expansion plans. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: How the Mouse Stumbled

By Ej Dickson A few years ago, I was talking to the host of a popular Disney-theme-park podcast when the conversation invariably led to where it always does between two Disney adults: Why do we love Disney so much, when everything it does seems tailor-made to piss us off? This was in 2022, in the midst of a particularly brutal public-relations war sparked by the so-called Don’t Say Gay bill, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ legislation prohibiting public schools from including materials about LGBTQ+ identities in their curricula. Many Disney employees were outraged by the bill, and because the company’s largest theme park is based in the state, there was massive internal pressure on then-CEO Bob Chapek to speak out against it. But Chapek did the opposite, explaining in a memo that publicly decrying Don’t Say Gay would “do very little to change outcomes or minds” and would only serve to “further divide and inflame.” Eventually, following days of bad press, Chapek issued a memo apologizing for not publicly opposing the bill. But the damage had already been done: Both progressives and conservatives were outraged, and amid the bad press, Disney refused to extend Chapek’s contract, leading to his ouster a few months later. According to reporting from The New York Times, Chapek would later tell people that he felt unfairly targeted, since his handling of the bill (or more accurately, its lack thereof) had been supported by the board as he went. Disney’s approach struck many, including myself, as the apogee of corporate bungling. It felt like the company was sending a clear message that although it would be happy to accept money from members of the LGBTQ+ community, that wasn’t tantamount to acknowledging its right to exist. And as a queer Disney fan myself, that message didn’t sit well with me. So I asked this podcast host: How did he square his own principles with loving Disney? Did he feel bad about it? He didn’t have to think twice about his answer. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 25 Most Influential Creators of 2024 “Not really,” he said. “They keep putting out stuff I like. Yes, it’s a big, soulless corporation. And, yes, I still love it. Because they make things that move me.” At the time, I thought this was kind of bullshit. There are a lot of brands that make things that move people. I, for one, am moved by fried-chicken sandwiches and carbonated water and $10 canvas sneakers. Yet I avoid buying Chick-fil-A or a SodaStream or Shein clothes, because there are aspects of their business practices that do not move me, that I, in fact, find repugnant. And while it may be momentarily satisfying to write a scathing Twitter thread calling out colonialist violence or evangelical Christian homophobia, voting with my wallet is by far my most effective form of protest. So why not do that, even if it means I can’t stream The Simpsons on Disney+, or purchase the new Pizza Planet-truck-inspired popcorn bucket? Is that really such a difficult tradeoff in order to affect some concrete, if marginal, change in the world? As it turns out, for me at least, the answer is yes. Because a few weeks — not even a few months — after the Don’t Say Gay debacle, I booked a trip to Disney World. I’ve gone on at least two more since then; in fact, I just came back from another one two weeks ago. I haven’t stopped buying my kids Disney-branded clothes and toys. I haven’t even canceled Disney+. The simple explanation for why I do this is because I am a hypocrite who is devoid of integrity. But I fear the actual explanation is far more complicated. I am one of a cadre of people who self-identify as Disney adults. While it would be easy to define this group as “adult Disney fans,” it’s a little bit like saying Beauty and the Beast is a movie about a hot girl who reads a lot and then develops Stockholm syndrome; it’s technically true, but it also kind of misses the point. Unlike Swifties or Trekkies or Philadelphia sports fans, Disney adults can’t really be defined by one or more demographic traits; you can’t say they skew white and female or middle-aged and nerdy or inebriated and prone to battery-throwing, because they are any and all of the above. They are united by only one factor: an unflagging belief that everything Disney puts out, from its streaming shows to its theme-park attractions to its cruises to its animated films, is superior to that of its competitors, in that it is infused with a specific ethos that can only be summarized as “Disney magic.” Disney magic is a term that’s even more difficult to define than Disney adult. On a customer-service level, it refers to the small touches that make a park guest’s stay more memorable: a free dessert here, an extra 30 seconds interacting with Chip and Dale there. It’s the type of attention to detail that is supposed to make you forget you’re spending thousands of dollars on a vacation, because Disney is not supposed to feel like a vacation at all. It’s supposed to feel like an enhanced version of reality, where the people are nicer, the streets are cleaner, and the food tastes (marginally) better. But there’s another aspect of Disney “magic” that’s more ineffable. It’s the way a full-grown adult man kind of has to catch his breath when he sees an actor playing Cinderella in full regalia. It’s the distinctly floral chlorine scent that wafts from the waters of Pirates of the Caribbean (so beloved that there are candles sold on Etsy inspired by the odor), or the way you automatically hear a clip-clop of hooves when “76 Trombones” pipes through the sound system of Main Street USA. It’s a feeling that marketing experts would likely chalk up to decades upon decades of a multinational conglomerate building brand allegiance across generations, but that a less cynical person would attribute to the apotheosis of the ideology popularized by Walt Disney himself, the idea that Disney will exist “as long as there is imagination left in the world.” Disney magic can be best summarized as a testament to the boundless human capacity for imagining, whether that applies to a child gazing up at Sleeping Beauty’s castle or an executive trying to figure out how to maximize quarterly Frozen-merch earnings. As a kid, I went to the Disney parks with my family probably every other year, because they were the one place where our conversations didn’t end in shouting and tears. I used to spend hours writing in my journal about vacations we took months ago, documenting every little detail like where we went to eat or about other families we’d met at the hotel. I would read and reread these entries, because they served as a reminder for me that there was a place where I could be happier than I was at home or at school, where all the kids thought I was a snaggle-toothed weirdo who read the dictionary for fun. (They were right, but that’s not germane.) So for me, Disney magic was the ability to envision a world where people were nicer than we were to one another, or than my family was to ourselves. Disney is, of course, not just its parks: It is an entire brand universe, comprising consumer products, publishing, media networks (ESPN, ABC, FX), studios (Pixar, LucasFilm, Marvel, 20th Century Studios), and international operations. It has such a stranglehold on the culture at large that according to one survey, Mickey Mouse has a higher level of name recognition than Santa Claus. Entire generations have grown up on a steady diet of Disney-owned properties, a list that has only expanded since the acquisitions of Marvel, LucasFilm, Pixar, and 20th Century Fox over the past two decades. One could theoretically spend an entire human life cycle exclusively consuming Disney products, from being swaddled in a Mickey-branded Huggies diaper to exchanging wedding vows in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle. And while there’s no such thing as a Disney-branded birth or funeral, I would bet my 401(k) that the idea has been floated in boardrooms. For the past few years, however, there has been a distinct sense that Disney has been slipping in its ability to consistently provide consumers its trademark magic. Though 2023, the company’s centennial, was projected to be a banner year, its last animated feature, Wish, was a box-office flop, as was Pixar’s Elemental; its Marvel entries, The Marvels and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, fared little better. In May 2024, CEO Bob Iger revealed at an investor conference that Disney+, the company’s streaming service that launched in 2019, was operating at a $4 billion loss, largely due to what he deemed an emphasis on “volume and not quality,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. Even the parks division, typically the most profitable of Disney’s verticals, is flailing, with operating profit declining three percent last quarter due to what CFO Hugh F. Johnston referred to as “moderation of consumer demand.” Share prices have plummeted. Over the past few months, I have spoken to various figures within Disney’s extensive orbit. Depending on who you speak to, the loss of Disney magic can be attributed to a wide range of factors: Many point to Bob Chapek, the parks head turned CEO who, by the end of his brief tenure, was so widely reviled that he was literally booed off the stage at the D23 fan expo. According to a September New York Times investigation, Chapek had essentially been pushed out by his predecessor Iger, who served as CEO for 16 years before retiring in 2021. A beloved figure within the company for years, Iger had become frustrated with Chapek’s poor management of Disney creatives, according to the Times piece, orchestrating his ouster even after he had personally hand-picked him as his successor. Others pointed to various external factors, such as the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to the parks being temporarily shuttered, tens of thousands of employees being laid off, and a $4.7 billion loss in the third quarter of 2020. The economic instability brought about by the pandemic “was bad for every company, but especially Disney, because they count so much on the parks” for revenue, says Scott Gustin, a reporter who covers theme parks. “And I don’t think things have been steady [at the company] since.” Overall, however, there is a distinct sense among almost everyone I spoke with that over the course of the past few decades, via a series of decisions motivated by an amalgam of greed and complacency, Disney is in serious danger of losing its position as a cultural juggernaut. “Disney’s never hidden the fact they’re all about your money,” one former midlevel corporate employee told me. “But they’ve also provided high-value entertainment, high-value experiences. Now, I would say the company has pivoted to nickel-and-diming. And they are not providing high-quality entertainment and experiences in the same way.” (Disney did not respond to requests for interview or comment.) These conversations painted a portrait of a corporation on autopilot and operating under the assumption that it is simply too big to fail. These sources contend that while this may have been true for Disney at one point, the company has squandered enough goodwill among its consumers that it no longer is. “There is a sense that if the company is not careful and they don’t adjust their course, that there is a point where people won’t see them as the leader anymore,” says one former employee. They also were reflective of a company that is dismissive toward, if not outright contemptuous of, its most loyal fans. According to two former corporate employees, the company eschews hiring what one referred to as “superfans,” viewing a love for the brand as “a huge turnoff.” “To me, it feels counterintuitive, because I feel like you’d want to hire the people who know the brand best, so they can protect it,” the person said. “Some of your biggest advocates are going to be these people.” Fans of the parks in particular have expressed mounting frustration with rising ticket prices, the elimination of various amenities, and the perceived decrease in quality of the overall experience. Many of the sources I spoke to for this piece told me that in recent years, staffing had been an issue at the parks, leading to attractions being shut down, and overwhelmed employees providing poor customer service. Some issued complaints directly to the company, only for such feedback to fall on deaf ears. “They tolerate fans,” the former corporate employee told me. “They take their money. But I feel like the fans and the bloggers and the influencers kind of annoy them, too. From my perspective, they don’t market toward the people who are their biggest moneymakers.” In true Disney-adult form, many sources I spoke with skewed toward personifying these failures, viewing them as reflective not of a multibillion-dollar corporation subject to shifting markets and trends, but of an individual whose actions cause personal disappointment. One source I spoke with likened the company to a toxic ex-boyfriend who you always come back to against your better judgment; another person, to a high school mean girl. Now, they say, the brand is facing the consequences. “People are revolting against Disney,” one former executive said. “They are sick of the bully in the room.” TO BE FAIR, DISNEY HAS BEEN in similarly dire straits before. In the early 1980s, the company had lost its primacy in the film and animation markets, churning out forgettable features like The Fox and the Hound and Pete’s Dragon. Between 1982 and 1984, its net income fell by 25 percent, making itself vulnerable to takeover attempts by corporate raiders. With the appointment of Michael Eisner as CEO in 1984, Disney’s fortunes shifted, ushering in the so-called Golden Age of Disney animation with features like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin; drastically expanding the parks, including Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios and Disneyland Paris; and acquiring ABC in 1995, including ESPN. Eisner also introduced the particularly brilliant marketing strategy of capitalizing on its existing intellectual property (IP) by selling limited-edition VHS tapes of classic Disney films, releasing them only for short periods of time. This strategy allowed millions of Gen X-ers and millennials to inject the iconography of Disneyana — the princesses, the castles, the songs, and, of course, the non-fucking mice — directly into their veins. In 2005, after a series of high-profile box-office flops and public feuds with former Disney animation exec Jeffrey Katzenberg, the board pressured Eisner to step down as CEO, leading him to hand the reins to then-President Bob Iger. As he documents in his book, The Ride of a Lifetime, Iger had inherited a company that was flailing as it had in 1984: The post-9/11 economic recession had sent Disney’s stock price tumbling, the animation department was adrift, and the advent of internet piracy had taken a bite of the company’s profits. “Almost every traditional media company, while trying to figure out its place in this changing world, was operating out of fear rather than courage,” Iger wrote, “stubbornly trying to build a bulwark to protect old models that couldn’t possibly survive the sea change underway.” In short, it was a climate very similar to that of our current media landscape, and Iger was able to clearly visualize a path forward for Disney that did not rely on traditional media frameworks. Foreseeing the impending demise of cable television, he became an early advocate for digital-first mobile-streaming content; he also led the acquisition of Pixar, which was by far outpacing Disney in terms of its creativity and ingenuity, thus successfully reinvigorating the animation team. Both of these decisions were widely derided and extremely expensive: “In essence,” Iger wrote of the launch of Disney+, the company’s streaming subscription service, “we were hastening the disruption of our own business, and the short-term losses were going to be significant.” But Iger was keenly aware of the fact that such short-term losses were essential to preserving the integrity of the brand and the quality of the product. “You have to look past whatever the commercial losses are and be guided, again, by the simple rule that there’s nothing more important than the quality and integrity of your people and your product,” he wrote. Under Iger’s leadership, Disney became a mega-conglomerate with massive global reach, with the company opening parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong and building its extensive library of IP with the acquisition of Marvel, LucasFilm, and 20th Century Fox. And while this rapid growth has gone a long way in establishing the company’s dominance in the global market, it has also come with accompanying growing pains, particularly following the 20th Century Fox merger in 2019, according to a number of former corporate employees I spoke with. Once a legendary Golden Age film studio that produced such classic films as The Sound of Music, Star Wars, and Titanic, Disney’s acquisition essentially “swallowed up” the company and “spit out what it didn’t want,” according to one source. “That was a very dark point,” says the source. “It was ugly. It was ruthless.” The deal was accompanied by multiple rounds of layoffs, as well as a growing sense of complacency that made many employees’ lives difficult. One former employee sums up the attitude as follows: “You’re so lucky to work here, because you get to work on the best content, the best movies, the best shows in the world. If you are unhappy, we don’t need you.” To a degree, that attitude has always existed within the Disney brand. Yet those I spoke with said it was more justifiable prior to the merger, as well as the launch of Disney+ in 2019. That year, the company hit a high-water mark both creatively and commercially: Thanks to the release of box-office smashes like Frozen II, Toy Story 4, Avengers Endgame, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the company grossed a record $13 billion globally, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the worldwide box office. Something shifted, however. Multiple sources tell me that employees felt they were under so much pressure to ramp up output for the platform, and to establish it as a viable competitor to Netflix and Amazon, that it became impossible to keep up. “There’s a pretty obvious decline in quality starting from 2019,” one former corporate executive tells me. “[2019’s] The Mandalorian is the only thing on Disney+ that was treated with the same care as they had treated [previous releases]. The pressure was just so intense to put out as much content as possible.” The end result has been a string of anemic superhero franchise entries (The Marvels), overhyped streaming series (the just-canceled The Acolyte), bloated franchise reboots (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny), underperforming live-action remakes (Mulan, Pinocchio), and uninspired animated features, previously the bulwark of the Disney entertainment division (Onward, Strange World, Elemental). Though there have been a few hits over the past few years — 2021’s WandaVision was critically acclaimed, while Disney Animation Studios’ Encanto got a huge boost from its soundtrack going viral on social media — much of its output has been disappointing. And while some of these failures could be explained by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with people failing to return to theaters in pre-2020 numbers, that explanation only goes so far. One source I spoke with speculated that the pandemic only served to highlight how little care Disney was giving to the quality of its entertainment offerings, operating on the assumption that people were bored at home and would watch anything put out under the Disney brand — an assumption that was proven wrong with the failure of what they viewed as subpar films like Soul and Luca. “Covid brought Disney to its knees,” one person told me. “And the problem is, Disney didn’t think it could be brought to its knees. So now it has to reckon with that.” On the parks side, previously Disney’s biggest revenue driver, the company has especially struggled. “There’s a lot of discourse around Disney’s rapid growth, and with that a lot of discourse about its perceived greed and the deep decline and quality of their movies and their parks,” says Jenny Nicholson, a YouTuber and former Disney cast member. In the spring of 2024, Nicholson posted a scathing four-hour video essay chronicling the downfall of one of the parks’ most notorious failures, Walt Disney World’s immersive Galactic Starcruiser hotel, which cost thousands of dollars a night and was open for barely 14 months before it shut down. Nicholson’s video essay condemning the project as an ill-conceived cash grab amassed more than 10 million views, seemingly due to its ability to tap into the mounting “frustrations” fans have with the parks, she says. These frustrations can be best summarized as the distinct feeling that guests are being cheated. Since the parks temporarily shut down in 2020, the company has slowly eliminated beloved amenities such as early park hours for resort guests, or free transportation from the airport to Disney hotels, or ways for fans to skip lines for free, all while steadily boosting ticket prices. “There seems to be a lot more push toward short-term profits as opposed to the overall longevity and reputation of the company,” says Nicholson. As a result of the skyrocketing prices, guests are increasingly shying away from the parks. On an August 2024 earnings call, CFO Hugh Johnston indicated that there had been a three percent decrease, or “a bit of a slowdown,” in operating income at the domestic parks during the third quarter. He added that the company anticipated a similar decline in earnings in future quarters, downplaying it as “a slight moderation in demand.” Such an admission must be particularly galling for the company in light of its arch rival, Universal Studios, building a massive theme park expansion called Epic Universe just a few miles away from Kissimmee, Florida, where Walt Disney World parks and resorts are located. One theme park journalist told me that over the past decade, Disney’s Imagineering division — the department focused on creating new theme-park rides and attractions — has focused too much on capitalizing on lucrative IP, such as the Star Wars and Marvel franchises, and less on creativity. “Where [consumers] sit, in 2024, we’re just after who’s innovating and who’s giving us thrills and spending money,” the journalist said. “And that’s Universal by far.” Disney’s overreliance on existing IP has been a source of frustration for fans for close to a decade — and if you look at the company’s slate of upcoming releases, it does not seem that they plan to pivot anytime soon. During the August 2024 call, Johnston noted that the downward trends in parks would likely be offset by the entertainment division, including the upcoming releases of highly anticipated films like the CGI-animated Lion King prequel Mufasa, and Moana 2. Citing those two examples is telling: Both are based on existing Disney IP, only emphasizing that the company has become overly reliant on adapting preexisting material, rather than generating new and fresh ideas. “Disney only has a few rabbits in their sleeve when it comes to bringing people to the movies,” one former employee told me. “There’s only so many animated films they can turn [into] live action. There’s only so many rides they can turn into films.” The quality, the former employee said, “is just not there anymore.” Ultimately, however, in speaking to various fans and insiders of all stripes, Disney’s decline can be boiled down to one crucial factor: arrogance. Having achieved market primacy for so long, and having garnered such a rabidly devoted and demographically wide-ranging fan base, there is an overwhelming sense that there is nothing Disney can possibly do to lose its hold over the public imagination. To adapt a famous 2016 election-era Trump boast, if Bob Iger stood in the middle of Main Street and shot Goofy in broad daylight, the company would probably lose some fans — but certainly not all. Its guiding ethos appears to be bolstered by the sense that it is simply too big to fail in any meaningful way. But if its recent string of failures are any indication, for one of the few times in the company’s history, it may not be right. ONCE, WHEN I WAS IN MY very early twenties, I was on a vacation with my family and we got into a fight. I can’t remember what it was about, but I was distraught enough that I needed to not be with them at the time. So I stalked off into the distance, sniffling and shaking and ignoring my phone calls, in search of someplace where I had always felt safe. And I ended up on the It’s a Small World ride. As my Friendship Boat gently rocked through the water, the intoxicating chlorine fragrance intermingling with that of the microwaved pizza from Pinocchio’s Village Haus next door, and animatronic kiwis and flying fish and can-can girls winking at me from the plasticine shores, it suddenly occurred to me how insane this all was. In a moment of emotional turmoil, I had not retreated into meditation or drugs or alcohol or cognitive behavioral therapy or any of the other tactics at my disposal. Instead, I’d beelined, as if by mammalian instinct, like a dying elephant making its way across the savannah, to a 1965 World’s Fair exhibition sponsored by Pepsi. Why had I done this? What was this going to offer me? How was this going to make me feel better? This wasn’t even an E-ticket attraction. There are about a million reasons I can think of to point out why It’s a Small World should not be emotionally effective. It’s long. It’s boring. It is built around a conception of global unity that does not celebrate cultural and political differences but completely eradicates them, as represented in the ride’s final tableau showing all the children of the world clad in the same generic white outfits, singing and holding hands, looking like a Benetton ad as conceived by the Hare Krishnas. Its primary designer, Mary Blair, was a genius whose artistic gifts were sublimated by the misogyny of the Disney company, resulting in a life of thwarted ambition that led to her early death from alcoholism-related dementia. And of course, there’s the song, two relentlessly peppy melodies played over the same set of chords, written by the songwriting duo the Sherman Brothers, who also wrote the music for The Parent Trap, Mary Poppins, and The Jungle Book. It’s frequently voted among the most annoying in history, even though it’s probably less so than Walt’s original proposal for the ride, which was to have all the children of the world sing the national anthem in their native tongues simultaneously. But no matter how many reasons I can come up with for why It’s a Small World should not move me, no matter how much I cringe when I think about sobbing on a boat ride surrounded by animatronic children, one fact remains: I am still moved. The idea that a group of disparate people from various backgrounds — a brilliant yet frustrated alcoholic, Russian Jewish immigrant brothers, a raging anti-communist and probable antisemite — could come together and present such a simple and united vision of children as a force for peace, is deeply moving to me. The idea that Walt Disney — a man who sold a vision of optimism and progressivism, yet was so contemptuous of his employees’ right to unionize that he voluntarily testified against them in the 1947 HUAC hearings, even firing the animator who created Goofy; the man who is perhaps most responsible for contempt for the little guy being integrated into Disney’s DNA — could set aside his own noxious politics to help present a vision of a better world for children is deeply moving to me. The reminder that we were all children once, that we all started out believing in a better world, undergirds so much of Disney’s best work. I’m thinking of the final scene in Mary Poppins, when the wealth-and-status-obsessed banker father finally presents his children with the kite they’d been begging him to mend; or the moment in Snow White and the Seven Dwarves when the orphan Snow White has narrowly escaped a violent death, and she’s scared and alone in the forest until she meets a bunch of woodland creatures and vows to stay resolute, the chirpy orchestral chorus for “With a Smile and a Song.” “There’s no use in grumbling when raindrops come tumbling/Remember you’re the one who can fill the world with sunshine,” she sings, as the bunnies wag their tails and the chipmunks scrunch their noses and the birds marvel at the beauty and the robustness of the human spirit. Trending He Played with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Who — A New Documentary Tells His Story Kris Kristofferson, Songwriter Whose Poetic Lyrics Transcended Genre, Dead at 88 Cross Canadian Ragweed Are Reuniting — At Least for One Huge Show Sean Combs' History of Controversies and Allegations ‘The Ellen Show’ Staffers Say Ellen DeGeneres’ New Netflix Special ‘Missed the Mark’ Every time I sing those words to my own kids — and I mean every time — I can’t help but tear up a little bit. Because it’s not a message of blind optimism or shiny, happy ignorance in the face of despair or anything else people like to accuse the Disney corporation of promoting — or which it has arguably promoted in its approach to things like the Don’t Say Gay legislation. It’s a message of power. You are the one who can fill the world with sunshine. You are the one who can use your own imagination to remake the world however you see fit. It’s a message I wish I had taken more to heart when I was an anxious, sad, scared little kid; I wish I had believed that I could have built my own magic. Frankly, had I done so, it probably would have saved my parents a lot of money. Over and over and over again, I continue to give Disney money, because Disney continues to make things that move me. I believe in Disney magic. I believe in the power of smart, creative people coming together to tell good stories in new and interesting ways, to teach us who we are and who we were and who we would like to be; and in the capacity to reinvent the world as long as there is imagination left in it.

Wall Street is heading for a lower open on the first day of October. The S&P 500 had a positive September for the first time in five years. September is historically the worst month of the year. With a 5.5% gain in the third quarter, the S&P 500 enters the seasonally bullish period into year-end up nearly 21% in 2024. 2. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday the central bank is not on a preset easing course, signaling smaller rate moves going forward after September's 50-basis-point cut. The next big event that could influence the Fed and the stock market comes Friday when the government releases its September employment report. 3. Pivotal Research initiated Club stocks Meta Platforms and Alphabet with buy ratings and respective price targets of $780 per share (35% upside to Monday's close) and $215 (28% upside). The analysts see strong revenue growth ahead for Meta and a "deep moat" competitively at Alphabet. 4. Citi raised its Medtronic price target to $92 per share from $85, though analysts remained cautious. The best medtech alternative is Club name GE Healthcare, which has a newly FDA approved diagnostic agent and a tailwind from Fed rate cuts going for it. GEHC shares have been a top performer in our portfolio lately. 5. Stephens started Club name Danaher with an overweight buy rating and a $315-per-share price target, implying roughly 13% upside. The analysts see a pickup in biotech funding and Chinese economic stimulus as positives, putting the life sciences giant in a better position next year. 6. Barclays said Apple is seeing weak demand for its new AI-ready iPhone 16. Club members know that I am always skeptical of these so-called channel checks. I have said it over and over again, the expected robust upgrade does not have to happen all at once. 7. Citi upgraded Anheuser-Busch Inbev to buy from neutral. Is a large buyback coming? In beer, we own Modelo and Corona brewer Constellation Brands, which reports earnings before Thursday's opening bell. Constellation reset expectations last month and the market took it in stride. We want to see what's next. 8. KeyBanc raised its Netflix price target to $760 per share from $735. Who would have thought that of the FANG and "Magnificent Seven" stocks the video streaming giant would be the best? Meanwhile, Raymond James downgraded Club name Disney to a market perform hold rating. The analysts are concerned about the moderating parks business. 9. East Coast and Gulf Coast union port workers went on strike after a midnight labor contract deadline came and went. It was the first walkout by the International Longshoremen's Association since 1977. Costco and Home Depot were among the Club names that were preparing for the work stoppage. 10. Wells Fargo cut its Boeing price target to $110 per share from $119 and kept its sell-equivalent rating on the aircraft maker. Boeing factory workers have been striking for nearly three weeks. Bloomberg reported that Boeing is thinking about a $10 billion equity raise.

Title: CVS Health to lay off nearly 3,000 workers in cost-cutting drive | CNN Business

Time Published: 2024-10-01T12:42:52Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the US health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s (CVS) workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. Related article Why Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are closing thousands of drug stores across America US drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Title: Allurion reports average 12.5% weight loss in latest study
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/allurion-reports-average-125-weight-loss-in-latest-study-93CH-3642683
Time Published: 2024-10-01T12:12:49Z
Full Content:
NATICK, Mass. - Allurion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ALUR), a medical technology company focused on obesity treatment, has published a systematic review and meta-analysis that demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of their Allurion Program. The analysis, which synthesized data from 11 observational studies involving 2,107 patients between 2016 and 2024, revealed an average weight reduction of 12.5% and a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) of 4.75 kg/m2 after four months of using the Allurion Balloon. Dr. Ram Chuttani, Chief Medical Officer and Founding Partner of Allurion, emphasized the importance of the findings, stating that the meta-analysis not only confirms the weight loss and BMI reduction outcomes but also highlights the metabolic health benefits associated with the program. These benefits include improvements in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glycemia levels. The Allurion Balloon, a key component of the Allurion Program, is a swallowable and procedure-less intragastric balloon designed to aid weight loss. It is complemented by the Allurion Virtual Care Suite, which includes a mobile app for consumers, insights for healthcare providers, and a connected scale. The program has been documented in 26 peer-reviewed journal articles and has been used by over 150,000 patients globally. While the Allurion Gastric Balloon is still considered an investigational device in the United States, the company reports a low rate of serious adverse events at just 0.90%. This data is based on the press release statement by Allurion Technologies and is intended to inform about the recent findings related to the Allurion Program. The full study can be accessed through a published article in a peer-reviewed journal. Investors and those following the medical technology sector may note that Allurion's approach to weight loss is part of a broader trend in the industry towards non-surgical and digitally supported therapies. However, as with all medical treatments, outcomes can vary, and regulatory approvals play a significant role in the availability and adoption of new technologies. In other recent news, Allurion Technologies reported a 25% increase in its second-quarter revenue to $11.8 million. Despite this, the company revised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance downward to $40 to $45 million due to regulatory and macroeconomic challenges. Roth/MKM recently initiated coverage on Allurion with a Buy rating, highlighting the potential U.S. approval of the company's weight-loss balloon. Chardan Capital Markets also maintained a Buy rating on Allurion's stock but reduced the price target to $2.50. Allurion has appointed Keith Johns to its Board of Directors, who brings extensive experience from the metabolic drug industry. The company reported safe and sustained weight loss in adolescents and patients using its Allurion Program, according to recent studies. However, Allurion faces a potential delisting from the New York Stock Exchange due to non-compliance with the exchange's minimum share price requirement, but plans to address this issue within the allotted six-month cure period. These are some of the recent developments for Allurion Technologies. While Allurion Technologies' meta-analysis demonstrates promising results for its weight loss program, the company's financial health presents a more complex picture. According to InvestingPro data, Allurion's market capitalization stands at $39.45 million, reflecting its position as a smaller player in the medical technology sector. Despite the company's impressive gross profit margin of 76.19% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, which aligns with the high-value nature of its innovative weight loss solutions, Allurion faces significant challenges. An InvestingPro Tip indicates that the company is "quickly burning through cash," which could be a concern for investors considering the capital-intensive nature of medical technology development and commercialization. Another InvestingPro Tip reveals that analysts anticipate a sales decline in the current year, with revenue growth showing a negative 23.59% in the last twelve months. This projection contrasts with the positive clinical outcomes reported in the meta-analysis, suggesting a potential gap between clinical success and market penetration. It's worth noting that InvestingPro offers 14 additional tips for Allurion Technologies, providing a more comprehensive view of the company's financial situation and market position. These insights could be particularly valuable for investors looking to understand the full picture beyond clinical data. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Sony has revealed that it already used machine learning in developing the 2023 game. By Hayley Williams on October 1, 2024 at 5:07AM PDT Sony's plans to augment its game-development process with AI and machine learning is already underway, the company revealed in its 2024 Company Report. In one example cited in the report, Sony used machine learning to augment the subtitling process for certain languages in Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Sony has revealed it used voice-recognition software to automatically synchronize subtitles with their corresponding voice lines in certain languages, dramatically reducing the speed of the subtitling process. Spider-Man 2 launched with text support for 27 languages, with 12 of those also available in fully dubbed audio. The company said that this use of machine learning, a subset of AI computing, was part of a broader plan to "[deliver] our IP rapidly and at low cost to a broader range of fans." The segment of the report focuses on technologies that have the potential to improve efficiency in development processes, including AI and machine learning as well as real-time 3D processing, and sensing and capturing technology. Sony isn't the first to include AI in its development workflow, and it definitely won't be the last. EA has spoken on using AI in the development of this year's College Football 25 to automatically create models for the thousands of players who were included in the game. Microsoft is also all-in on AI, as is Amazon Games. Nintendo is one of the few major players in the industry to speak out against the use of AI in game development at this point. While so many companies are excited about the potential for AI in game development, few have touched on the potential impact it may have on the industry's human workforce, even as sweeping layoffs continue to impact developers and support staff across the industry. Video-game voice actors and mo-cap performers are currently on strike, with the use of AI a key concern for union SAG-AFTRA. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

A Closer Look at the Spread of Algorithmic Management Systems—Which Contributed to $8 Billion in Turnover Costs and a 45% Injury Rate at Amazon—Across Corporate America Man lying on the floor. Accident in warehouse With the help of digital technology, machines can perform complex managerial tasks, like supervising employees and assessing job candidates. It is no wonder that 57% of workers expect AI to change the way they do their current job, and 36% expect it to go as far as replacing their current job. With employees often described as a business’s most important assets and human capital a key factor in economic competitiveness, investors and policymakers alike must understand and manage the risks to businesses and workers stemming from the deployment of digital technologies. And because JUST Capital research shows that 51% of workers at Russell 1000 companies, who make up 15% of the employed population in the US in 2021, are not earning a living wage, defined as sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and his or her family in a particular place, long-term investors must also understand and mitigate the harms that AI can cause to low-wage workers. While there has been a recent surge of interest in and funding for AI safety or mitigating catastrophic societal-scale threats of uncontrolled AI systems, ex/ante founder and managing partner Zoe Weinberg explains that more proximate harms—like discrimination, bias, and fairness—are taking back seat. The time has come for long-term investors to take the drivers’ seat to first understand and address these harms. The ways in which AI can impact job quality are manifold. This article—the first in a series on AI and the workplace—focuses on algorithmic management, the delegation of managerial functions to algorithms in an organization, which is becoming an important part of AI-driven digital transformation of companies. This article closely examines the impact of algorithmic management on Amazon to illustrate why algorithmic management systems should matter across portfolios to all investors. The Promise of Algorithmic Management Systems Organizations increasingly rely on algorithmic-based HR decision-making to monitor employees, driven in part by the technology industry’s claims that its decision-making tools are efficient and objective. Algorithmic management systems can increase the scale of management operations: matching Uber’s 149 million riders with its over 7 million drivers in 10,000 cities across 70 countries through algorithms is indeed unprecedented. Companies also harness algorithms to increase efficiency: UPS trucks have long been equipped with computers that give drivers advice and filled with sensors that record when drivers open doors, buckle their seat belts, and back up their trucks. In addition, algorithmic management systems can make employees more effective: MetLife call center workers receive real-time feedback from AI on whether they are not empathetic enough, sound tired, or speak too quickly. A Slippery Slope A slippery slope of mud and melting snow. Photo Tim Clayton (Photo by Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty ... [+] Images) However, researchers from MIT find that focusing solely on efficiency can lower employee satisfaction, wellbeing, and performance in the long-run by treating workers like “cogs in a machine” or triggering employees to continue working to the point of exhaustion. As Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), a coalition of faith-based and values-based investors, and OpenMIC, a nonprofit focused on responsible use of digital technologies, explain in their new report, Dehumanization, Discrimination and Deskilling: The Impact of Digital Tech on Low-Wage Workers, a critical element of algorithmic management systems is the monitoring and surveillance of workers in violation of their human rights. More specifically, the report outlines a number of human rights impacted by digital technologies, including right to privacy (Article 12 in the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights) and occupational safety and health (ILO Convention 155 in 1981 and 187 in 2006). Why This Should Matter to Investors Worker well-being, satisfaction, and human rights should matter to all investors. When algorithmic management systems detract from them, the resulting higher worker turnover, higher injury rates, increasing regulatory fines and sanctions, and increasing regulation can materially dampen long-term value creation. Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to the Financial Statements at Amazon Skillful worker attending brief meeting in the factory . Industrial people and manufacturing labor ... [+] concept . Amazon—the second largest private employer in the US and the fourth largest US company by market capitalization—is worth closely examining because of the scale of the impact of algorithmic management on labor wellbeing and shareholder value. The lessons learned from this close examination are relevant to other companies that also use algorithmic management. Over the past couple of years, researchers, investigators, lawmakers, and workers have been reinforcing each other’s claims that Amazon’s high injury rates are linked to the company’s workplace productivity quotas and surveillance practices. For example, Amazon warehouse worker Daniel Olayiwola, who became the first warehouse worker in corporate history to present his own resolution at Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting in 2022, highlighted the dangers of Amazon’s “Time Off Task” (TOT) policy, which tracks the amount of time per day to the minute that workers do not scan products (including during bathroom breaks), its rate system, the number of products that employees scan per hour, and algorithmic firing based on TOT and rates. During the pandemic, the New York Times reported 3% turnover a week or 150% turnover a year, which means that on average Amazon had to replace its entire workforce every eight months. According to leaked internal documents marked “Amazon Confidential” that tech news website Engadget reviewed and reported on, the cost of attrition was an estimated $8 billion annually for Amazon in 2021—nearly 25% of Amazon’s 2021 net profit of $33 billion. Engadget further reported that regretted attrition, or workers choosing to leave the company, occurred twice as often as unregretted attrition, or layoffs and firings, and that only one out of three new hires in 2021 stayed with the company for 90 or more days. Amazon’s announcement last week to increase the average total compensation package for fulfillment and transportation employees in the US to over $29 per hour—Amazon’s largest ever investment of over $2.2 billion in pay and benefits—may be a cost-effective way to reduce the $8 billion cost of employee turnover or said differently, it may be hazard pay. Because it’s challenging to update information gleaned from leaked confidential documents, and we must try to understand worker satisfaction and algorithmic monitoring following the pandemic, let’s also discuss the interim report released by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which was investigating workplace safety. According to the report, during Prime Day week in 2019, Amazon’s rate of recordable injuries—the injuries that Amazon is required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)—was over 10 injuries per 100 workers. In addition, the report explains that Amazon’s total injury rate, which includes injuries that the company is not required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), was nearly 45 injuries per 100 workers during the week of Prime Day in 2019. That is almost half of the company’s warehouse workers! The report highlighted that although Amazon’s total injury rate includes minor injuries, such as bruises and superficial cuts, it also includes serious injuries, such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions, which the company should have treated as recordable injuries. Amazon examined the issue closely in a memo titled “2021 Prime Day Lessons Learned,” which analyzes staffing performance for the period leading up to Prime Day in 2021. As context, Amazon had 117,300 employees in 2013, growing steadily to the peak of 1.6 million in 2021 before declining in 2022 and 2023 to 1.5 million. The document states that Amazon had only a 54.7% success rate meeting its hiring target from the end of March through the beginning of May in 2021. That means Amazon filled barely more than half of the positions it needed to fill to have fully staffed warehouses during that period. From the beginning of May through the end of June—ending the week of Prime Day—the company met only 71.2%. Indeed, worker satisfaction and worker safety are deeply intertwined. Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to Regulatory Risk at Amazon Organization and transportation in the warehouse Several states, including New York and California, passed bills that require companies to disclose production quotas to warehouse workers and prevent companies from retaliating against employees for failing to meet undocumented quotas. US Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass) earlier this month introduced the Warehouse Worker Protection Act at a federal level, which if passed would require companies to provide written notice to workers of quotas and prohibits dangerous quotas, including those that rely on constant surveillance. In addition, the Stop Spying Bosses Act, introduced by US Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Brian Schatz (D-HI), would require any employer collecting data on employees or applicants to disclose such information in a timely and public manner, prohibit employers from collecting sensitive data on individuals (i.e., off-duty data collection, data collection that interferes with organizing, etc.), create rules around the usage of automated decision systems to empower workers in employment decisions, and establish the Privacy and Technology Division at the Department of Labor to enforce and regulate workplace surveillance as novel technologies evolve and grow. As a case in point, two warehouses violating California’s Warehouse Quotas law cost Amazon $5.9 million in June 2024 alone. If passed, the federal bills would expand the scope of costly fines. The biggest threat to Amazon is likely to be action by government regulatory bodies. Amazon’s largest regulatory fine was EUR 746 million (US$887 million) in 2021 for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European privacy law. More recently, in January 2024, French regulator CNIL fined Amazon France Logistique EUR 32 million (US$35 million) for an “excessively intrusive” surveillance system: CNIL said that tracking the inactivity of employees’ scanners was illegal and that the system set up to measure the speed at which items were scanned as “excessive.” As US regulation catches up to EU regulation on AI and privacy, regulatory risk could weigh down Amazon stock price, which at $187.99 per share nears all-time highs. Spreading Like a Virus Coronavirus Covid-19 Amazon is not alone. Algorithmic management systems are pervasive. According to researchers at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, across the country, employers are increasingly using data and algorithms in ways that stand to have profound consequences for wages, working conditions, and equity. Countless workplace surveillance systems collect data about worker activities through a wide variety of means, including handheld devices, point-of-sale systems, mobile phones, fingerprint scanners, fitness apps, wellness apps, smart cameras, microphones, and body sensors, according to Aiha Nguyen, who explores the future of labor for Data & Society, a nonprofit research organization. Nguyen says algorithmic management systems enable “work speedups, employment insecurity and instability, a shift of risks of and costs from employers to workers,” among other issues. The AI-driven digital transformation of companies is only beginning, and it would behoove long-term investors to understand and shape it. This series of articles—which will also cover exploitation of data workers, the gig economy, and automated hiring tools—aims to do just that. Investors that can proactively identify and reduce exposure to these harms in their portfolios should be better able to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and immunize their portfolios from regulatory risk.

We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks. On September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market. According to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome. He believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks. As the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets. Miller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle. Miller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China. Now that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term. Our Methodology To come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners across 200 countries. The company is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. As for its cloud segment, AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters, making it a star performer. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making strides on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips to reduce its dependence on other companies. Speaking of AI, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. The new models are capable of visual reasoning, document processing, and multilingual translation. Amazon’s growth is undeniable which explains its position on our list. Analysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 17% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds and Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder, according to the Insider Monkey database. Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company." Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Culture Wars And Unconstitutional Laws: The Threat To America's Future
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffraikes/2024/10/01/culture-wars-and-unconstitutional-laws-the-threat-to-americas-future/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T10:00:40Z
Full Content:
Ill-advised and unconstitutional ideological crusades by conservative state legislators are infringing on the rights of American businesses and endangering America's future. Climate change, conceptual illustration. The Climate Crisis is Here… It's no secret that the accelerating impacts of climate change are being felt worldwide. 2024 is likely to be the warmest year in recorded history, and nine of the hottest years on record have all been in the last decade. To take just one example, residents of Phoenix, Arizona experienced 113 days in a row this summer with over 100-degree temperatures. With hotter days come more extreme weather events. In what was billed as a once-in-a-1000-year event, Sarasota, Florida and its environs experienced as much as ten inches of rain in just 24 hours this past June. (This followed once-in-a-millennium rainstorms in St. Louis, Kentucky, Death Valley in 2022, and Fort Lauderdale in 2023.) July saw Hurricane Beryl become the earliest-ever Category 5 hurricane to develop in the Atlantic. Last week, after another once–in–a–thousand–year rainstorm in Western NC, Hurricane Helene devastated the Southeast, bringing catastrophic flooding to Appalachian cities. As climate impacts become increasingly extreme, we are collectively racing against time to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions before we reach 1.5 degrees of warming. The good news is the global renewable energy boom is here. With costs coming down and technology improving, the world will install an estimated 593 gigawatts of solar capacity this year, nearly 30% more than in 2023 and six times more than in 2019. Here in the U.S., led by California and Texas, we now have eight times more solar power and twice as much wind power as a decade ago. Battery storage capacity is also expected to nearly double this year, meaning more renewable energy can be saved and used whenever needed. …But Texas Legislators Would Halt Our Progress Since its oil boom days, Texas has always been an energy leader, and these days are no exception – Texas now leads the country in wind power and is second only to California in solar. The clean energy transition is crucial for the Lone Star state since Texas is especially threatened by warming temperatures and hurricanes. Its statewide energy grid is also increasingly overwhelmed: Texas suffered 210 power outages between 2020 and 2023, more than any other state. So, given the urgent necessity of decarbonizing our energy grid and Texas's role as a renewable energy leader, why have its lawmakers been trying to sabotage progress against climate change? In 2021, Texas conservatives passed S.B. 13, a misguided and arguably unconstitutional law requiring all state entities, like pension funds and the K-12 education endowment, to divest any business that has moved away from supporting fossil fuels. Meant as an ideological attack against the growing move towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, S.B. 13, according to a study by the Texas Association of Business, cost Texas nearly $700 million in lost economic activity, $181 million in annual earnings, more than 3000 full-time jobs, and more than $37 million in tax revenues in F.Y. 2022-2023. S.B. 13's ideological crusade also prompted five of the largest underwriters for municipal bonds in Texas – JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Fidelity – to exit the Texas market, meaning much higher borrowing costs for Texas cities. These five banks "used to underwrite about 35% of the debt in the market," notes Wharton Business professor Daniel Garrett, "so they've left a really big gap." The Texas public school fund also pulled $8.5 billion from Blackrock to comply with the law. Last month, supported by Democracy Forward, the American Sustainable Business Council (ASBC) filed a lawsuit against S.B. 13 and a similar law, S.B. 19, which forces state funds to divest from companies that restrict business with gunmakers. "SB-13 is not just a misguided policy," says David Levine, president and co-founder of ASBC. "It is an unconstitutional attack that stifles free speech and punishes businesses for prioritizing responsible investments." In fact, an Oklahoma District Court Judge has already struck down Oklahoma's anti-ESG law for similar reasons. As Chris Tomlinson wrote in the Houston Chronicle of this "unconstitutional, authoritarian power grab that hurts all Texans," "whether you worry about climate change or not, the real issue is whether the government should dictate any company's investment strategy. True conservatives believe elected officials should stay out of private sector decisions." It's Not Just Texas. Unfortunately, Texas lawmakers are not alone in these attempts to hamstring American businesses. Per Reuters, 2022 saw at least 44 new bills or laws in 17 red states that attempted to penalize companies for investment strategies or behaviors they deemed too progressive, up from a dozen in 2021. Among these was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's infamous "Stop WOKE Act," which attempted to ban workplace trainings on improving race relations and which a federal judge permanently blocked in July. Similarly, the Republican-controlled House in Georgia passed a bill cutting tax breaks for Delta Airlines, the state's largest private employer, after its CEO lambasted new voting restrictions there. (The bill failed to pass the Senate.) Even more frightening, the anti-ESG push has now been taken up by the authors of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation blueprint to supercharge a second Trump presidency. In their report, they call for Trump's Department of Labor to "remove ESG considerations from ERISA," the law setting minimum standards for pension and health plans. After deriding ESG for taking into account woke causes like "reducing greenhouse gas emissions," the Project 2025 report decrees that "DOL should prohibit investing in ERISA plans on the basis of any factors that are unrelated to investor risks and returns." However, considering the impacts of climate change is precisely the type of long-term risk that businesses and investors should be evaluating to protect their returns and financial health. Of course, the government plays an indispensable role in regulating companies, so they follow the law, do right by their workers and communities, and don't conduct business with America's enemies. But trying to force U.S. companies, by law, to uphold far-right conservative ideology is simply a bridge too far. It is, in a word, unconstitutional. And amidst a global climate crisis that threatens all Americans, especially those most vulnerable in our society, these misguided ideological crusades don't just jeopardize our future prosperity and global competitiveness—they endanger our communities, economy, and planet.

Title: The 2024 Forbes 400: The 25 Wealthiest People In America

Itwas another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months—some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars. In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400. This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500’s 27% return. Much of the gains come from two people: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They’re two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits. Most of these 25 were among the top 25 last year, too. But there are three fresh faces: traders Jeff Yass (who ranked No. 28 in 2023) and Thomas Peterffy (who was No. 27), plus Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who jumped from No. 31 last year to No. 25 in 2024 on the back of the retailer’s rising stock. They replace MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who continues to give away her fortune; Miriam Adelson, whose shares of casino operator Las Vegas Sands have hit a cold streak; and investor Len Blavatnik, whose stock in Warner Music Group is worth less than a year ago. Zuckerberg jumped five spots, to No. 3; Huang jumped six, to No. 11. Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after we increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year. Here are the top 25 members of the 2024 Forbes 400 list: One of Sam Walton’s eight grandchildren, he inherited an estimated 4% stake in Walmart from his father, John Walton, who died in a 2005 plane crash. Lukas, who survived childhood cancer, founded and runs Builders Vision, a sustainability-focused philanthropic and impact-investing platform that has doled out more than $3 billion since launching in 2021. He is one of just two Forbes 400 members under age 40 (the other: VC investor Josh Kushner, No. 347, who is 39). His mother, Christy Walton (No. 48), cosigned a letter urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election in July and has been fundraising for Kamala Harris. Two members of the family’s third generation still sit on Walmart’s board: Jim’s son Steuart Walton (Lukas’ first cousin) and Rob’s son-in-law Greg Penner, who is chairman. “On the doorsteps of the Olympic Games,” Knight wrote this summer in a letter to U.S. athletes, whose jerseys Nike designed, “we need to reignite the passion, desire and the want to win.” His sportswear giant could use a pep talk, too. Nike stock is down 15% since last year, making Knight, who created the company with his University of Oregon track coach in 1964, one of just three in the Top 25 to be poorer than in 2023. Peterffy is more than $10 billion richer than last year as shares of Interactive Brokers Group, the electronic trading firm he founded in 1993, rose 30%. The company booked $4.3 billion in revenue last year, a 42% year-over-year increase. Since he failed to persuade Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin to enter the Republican presidential primary race, Peterffy, a longtime supporter of free-market policies, has kept quiet on Trump’s reelection bid. Griffin’s hedge fund, Citadel, the most profitable of all time, raked in $8.1 billion in trading profits last year. Since then, Griffin, never one to leave money idle, has donated $50 million to the University of Miami, dropped $45 million on a Stegosaurus skeleton (a record price in the dinosaur auction business) and shelled out more than $90 million for an estate in Saint-Tropez, France. In August, Schwarzman and his wife announced plans to open their Miramar estate in Newport, Rhode Island, to the public as a museum upon their deaths. They spent $27 million on the Gilded Age mansion in 2021 and have been restoring it ever since. In May, Schwarzman, the cofounder and CEO of $1 trillion (assets) investment firm Blackstone, announced he’s backing Trump for president, two years after vowing to support someone else in 2024. In August, their Mars Inc. announced it’s gobbling up snack and cereal maker Kellanova (formerly Kellogg’s) for $35.9 billion. The deal will put brands like Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Froot Loops under the Mars umbrella alongside Snickers, M&M’s and Kind bars. It’s the company’s biggest acquisition since it bought Wrigley in 2008 for $23 billion. The Mars siblings own an estimated two-thirds of the $50 billion (2023 revenue) business but have no role in daily operations. Yass’ fortune nearly doubled after Forbes revalued his trading firm, Susquehanna International Group—and Yass’ share of profits—based on tax returns leaked to ProPublica. With a potential TikTok ban threatening Susquehanna’s estimated 15% stake in the social media app, Yass has made nearly $70 million of federal political contributions during the 2024 election cycle, including $20.5 million to the Club for Growth Action, a conservative super PAC that has publicly opposed the TikTok ban (but denies having been influenced by Yass). In August, Koch Industries became Koch, Inc., as Charles rebranded the increasingly tech-focused $125 billion (revenue) conglomerate for the first time since taking over the family firm after his father’s 1967 death. Julia Koch, the widow of his brother David (d. 2019), and her three children paid nearly $700 million that same month for 15% of BSE Global, which owns the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA’s New York Liberty and operates the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Rob Walton retired from Walmart’s board in June after more than four decades as a director of the firm his father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962. He and his siblings’ estimated 35% stake in the retail giant is worth more than ever as shoppers flock to Walmart’s “Every Day Low Price” strategy to escape high inflation, driving both its revenue and shares to all-time highs. Jim still chairs the family’s $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. Alice, the richest woman in America for the ninth time in 10 years, reclaimed the title of the world’s wealthiest woman in early September from L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France for the first time since May 2022. Dell scored his biggest payday ever in November, when semiconductor giant Broadcom acquired his cloud computing spinoff VMware; Dell swapped his 39% stake for an estimated $33 billion in cash and Broadcom shares. Around that time, he put $3.6 billion in cash and stock into his family’s charitable foundation and pumped at least $500 million into a donor-advised fund. Dell’s net worth is up 40% this year, thanks to 90% and 64% jumps in Broadcom and Dell Technologies share prices, respectively. Huang keeps climbing into rarer air: He has added $63.3 billion to his fortune, pushing him up six more notches on The Forbes 400 (he jumped 31 spots last year), on the back of a 162% rise in Nvidia shares. As his wealth grows, so does his celebrity: Paparazzi followed his every move on a trip to his native Taiwan this summer—a phenomenon termed “Jensanity.” Huang cofounded Nvidia, which designs and sells more chips used for artificial intelligence systems than any other company, in 1993 and has served as CEO and president since. The former mayor of New York City and cofounder of financial-data and media firm Bloomberg LP was awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Biden in May. Over the next three months, Bloomberg announced $1.6 billion of gifts to the medical schools of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, and four historically Black colleges. The Microsoft cofounder’s rank is lower than it has been in 34 years, due mostly to a new Forbes estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement. In September, Netflix released a five-episode series called What’s Next? The Future with Bill Gates, which tackles topics including AI and income inequality. In February 2025, he’s set to publish a memoir, Source Code. TerraPower, the next-generation nuclear power company he cofounded in 2008, broke ground on a demonstration plant in Wyoming in June. That same month, his ex-wife, Melinda, resigned as co-chair of the couple’s Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and walked away with $12.5 billion for her own philanthropy. “Damn, I’m fired up!” exclaimed Ballmer in August at the grand opening of his Los Angeles Clippers’ new 18,000-seat Intuit Dome stadium, which boasts a 38,000-square-foot circular scoreboard. He bought the Clippers a decade ago for a then-record $2 billion after running Microsoft as CEO for 14 years, and spent $2 billion of his own money on the new stadium; Forbes now values the team at more than $4.6 billion. Net worth: $136 billion | Source of wealth: Google | Age: 51 A federal judge ruled in August that Page and Brin’s Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, which is responsible for 57% of parent company Alphabet’s sales. (The tech giant reportedly plans to appeal.) Shares hit an all-time high in July thanks to Google’s continued push into generative AI and cloud services, including a partnership with Oracle, before slipping in recent months. More than seven decades in, the investing legend is staying plenty busy. In August, Berkshire Hathaway became America’s first non-tech company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. In June, Buffett—the nation’s greatest philanthropist, with some $60 billion in lifetime giving—donated $5.3 billion of Berkshire stock, with a twist: He clarified that the vast majority of his remaining fortune will go to a charitable trust run by his three children, instead of the Gates Foundation, as was previously assumed. It was another banner year for the Oracle cofounder, chief technology officer and more than 40% shareholder, with the software firm’s shares up 12% to record highs. He’s spending accordingly: Ellison splashed out nearly $300 million on a Florida resort in August, adding to his $2 billion–plus real estate portfolio. He also plans to invest a reported $6 billion into the on-again-off-again merger between Paramount Global and Skydance, his son David’s media production company. No one got richer over the past year, in sheer dollar terms, than Zuck. He’s $75 billion wealthier, and ranks five spots higher, following a 75% runup in Meta Platforms stock. Revenue has been growing more than 20% per quarter, and the social media giant repurchased $31 billion of its shares over the past year. Zuckerberg, who turned 40 in May, has taken on a new look, sporting a gold chain, letting his wavy hair grow out and ditching his uniform hoodie for a shearling jacket. He also surprised his wife, Priscilla, with a seven-foot-tall statue in her likeness. Since last summer, Bezos has snapped up three homes on Miami’s “billionaire bunker” island for $234 million. He has the cash: Since moving to tax-friendly Florida last November, the Amazon founder has offloaded more than $8 billion (pretax) of his shares; he still owns 9% of the e-commerce Leviathan, whose stock is up 29%. The Bezos Earth Fund, through which he has given $2 billion of a $10 billion pledge, will hand out up to $100 million to winners of an AI for Climate and Nature challenge beginning later this year. Tesla’s self-proclaimed “technoking” tops The Forbes 400 for the third straight year, despite losing $7 billion as shares of his electric vehicle maker fell 14% and a Delaware judge voided $56 billion of his stock options in January. In May, Musk’s new AI startup, xAI, raised $6 billion at a $24 billion valuation. A month later, his rocket maker, SpaceX, launched a tender offer valuing the company at around $210 billion, up from nearly $180 billion. In an X post seen by 220 million, Musk endorsed Donald Trump within an hour of the assassination attempt on the former president. Trump now vows to name Musk to a new government efficiency commission if elected.

Title: The 2024 Forbes 400 List Of Wealthiest Americans: Facts And Figures

Forbes calculated fortunes using stock prices from September 1, 2024. It’s a record-smashing year for America’s 400 richest people. After adding nearly $1 trillion to their fortunes over the past 12 months, The Forbes 400 are worth a collective $5.4 trillion, by far the most ever. It now takes a record $3.3 billion to make the list, up from $2.9 billion in 2023. In general, the richer you were, the richer you got. Just 25 people—a dozen of them worth $100 billion or more—are responsible for $500 billion of the gains. These top 25 now holds more than $2.5 trillion in wealth, nearly half the list’s total net worth. The richest person in America, for the third straight year, is Elon Musk, who is worth an estimated $244 billion. Despite dropping $7 billion in wealth over the past year amid sputtering Tesla stock and an ongoing battle over his $56 billion stock options package, Musk remains some $47 billion ahead of No. 2 Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, who is worth an estimated $197 billion. Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $181 billion) climbed from No. 8 last year to No. 3 in 2024 thanks to the huge rebound in shares of Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Alice Walton continues her reign as the richest woman in the U.S., her ninth time in a decade. With shares of Walmart, which her father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962, up by 41% in the past year, she’s worth an estimated $89.2 billion, good for No. 15 overall. Walton is one of just 67 women on The Forbes 400, up from 60 last year. As a group, the list’s women are worth a combined $839 billion, compared to $621 billion in 2023. Diane Hendricks ($21.9 billion) remains the wealthiest self-made woman in America, one of a record 13 women on the list who built—rather than inherited—their fortune. Overall, 67% of The Forbes 400 is self-made, meaning they founded their own company or helped build one, though some traveled much longer and tougher paths to great wealth than others. Forbes once again assigned everyone on the list a self-made score, from 1 to 10, with 10 being the true rags-to-riches stories. Those remain rare—just 25 out of the 400. Despite it requiring more money than ever to make the list, 23 billionaires were able to elbow their way into the ranks this year. These newcomers include Todd Graves ($9.5 billion), who created the Raising Cane’s fast food chain; Peter Cancro ($5.6 billion), who built and runs Jersey Mike’s Subs; Jayshree Ullal ($4.4 billion), the CEO of cloud networking firm Arista Networks; Leonid Radvinsky ($3.8 billion), the owner of OnlyFans; and Alex Karp ($3.6 billion), the cofounder and CEO of data mining company Palantir. Another 11 people who fell off a previous Forbes 400 list returned to the ranks this year. The most notable: Donald Trump ($4.3 billion), who has ridden the volatile stock price of Truth Social parent-company Trump Media & Technology Group back onto the list, part of a broader ploy to wring billions in wealth out of his political career. These newcomers and returnees displaced several less-fortunate billionaires who lost their spot among the nation’s richest people. Among this year’s 30 drop-offs: Vince McMahon ($2.5 billion), who stepped down as executive chairman of WWE-parent company TKO Holdings in January amid sexual assault allegations, which he has denied. Aneel Bhusri ($3.2 billion) of software firm Workday, meanwhile, is one of ten 2023 400 members who got richer over the past year but were displaced by better-performing billionaires. They join a growing list of American billionaires who are simply too poor to make the cut. For the first time ever, there are more American billionaires not on The Forbes 400 than there are on it: 415 and counting. That includes plenty of famous faces. Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion) is not rich enough for this list. Neither are Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion), Bruce Springsteen ($1.1 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion) or Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion). The youngest member of the ranks is Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who is 38 years old and worth an estimated $33.9 billion. Venture capitalist and real estate mogul Josh Kushner ($3.8 billion), 39, is the only other listee under the age of 40. On average, the members of the 2024 Forbes 400 are 70 years old. The eldest is Dole Food Company’s David Murdock ($3.7 billion), who is 101. The richest Americans’ net worths have skyrocketed, but their generosity has not. Forbes once again investigated the lifetime charitable giving of every member of the list. A third have donated less than 1% of their fortunes so far, earning a lowly 1 on the Forbes philanthropy score; only ten people—2.5% of the list—have given away 20% of their riches or more, earning the highest mark, a 5.

Title: Taylor Swift, Magic Johnson, Sam Altman: The American Billionaires Too Poor To Make The 2024 Forbes 400 List

There aren’t many things $1 billion won’t get you, but a spot on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans is one of them. Not even $3 billion will do it. This year, the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. are all worth at least $3.3 billion—a new record, and $400 million more than last year. That high bar means scores of America’s most prominent billionaires are simply not rich enough to make the cut. In fact, for the first time ever, there are more U.S. billionaires not on the list—415 and counting—than on it. These too-poor billionaires include celebrity moguls like Oprah Winfrey (estimated net worth: $3 billion), Kim Kardashian ($1.7 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion), Magic Johnson ($1.2 billion) and Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion). Dozens of prominent tech and finance leaders don’t have enough scratch either, including virtual reality scion Palmer Luckey ($2.4 billion), Scale AI cofounder Alexandr Wang ($2 billion), Bilt Rewards founder Ankur Jain ($1.2 billion) and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ($1 billion). Of course, there’s always next year. Just ask Jayshree Ullal, the president and CEO of Arista Networks, who was $100 million too poor in 2023 but, over the past 12 months, has ridden Arista’s skyrocketing stock price onto The Forbes 400 for the first time, with an estimated $4.4 billion net worth. And Altman may rank among the richest 400 Americans soon enough, too: According to multiple reports, OpenAI is currently discussing a restructuring that would change it from a non-profit into a for-profit corporation, and give Altman equity in the company for the first time. Bloomberg reported he may get a 7% stake in the newly restructured firm; Altman denied this to OpenAI staff last week, saying there are no plans for him to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. Though it may change soon, the CEO of OpenAI currently has no equity in the artificial intelligence giant he runs. Instead, he’s made a fortune through smart venture investments, including stakes in Stripe, Reddit and Helion, a research company looking to build the world’s first fusion power plant. OpenAI told investors that it’s expecting to soon close on a new funding round, which according to reports could value the firm at as much as $150 billion. The action star joined Forbes’ billionaires list earlier this year after our reporting revealed how he parlayed $500 million in Hollywood earnings into a diverse investment empire. His most valuable asset: a minority stake in one of the world’s biggest investment funds, Dimensional Fund Advisors. Seinfeld is the richest comedian in America thanks to lucrative syndication profits from his namesake TV show, including a five-year, $500 million deal with Netflix. Forbes named “The Boss” the latest entertainer to become a billionaire in July. His fortune comes from a lifetime of touring and selling records, as well as a $500 million deal to sell his music catalog in 2021. Jain is the founder and CEO of Bilt Rewards, a New York City-based credit card issuer that allows users to gain rewards – including airline and hotel points – off their rent payments. The company raised $200 million from private investors at a $3.1 billion valuation in January. The NBA superstar built his fortune off the court, including buying stakes in the Washington Commanders NFL team and Los Angeles Dodgers MLB team. His biggest asset, however, is a 60% stake in the $27 billion (assets under management) life insurance company Equitrust. A former door-to-door fax machine salesperson, Blakely made her fortune founding the shapewear brand Spanx. In August, she unveiled her latest invention: a stiletto-heeled sneeker called “Sneex.” The founder of online fashion retailer Fashion Nova – known for its social media and celebrity marketing – has spent $300 million over the past four years buying up Los Angeles real estate. In August, he paid $118 million for a new 175,000-square-foot headquarters for his fashion business. Swift’s record-breaking Eras tour and massively valuable music catalog propelled her into the three-comma club last October. Since then she’s released her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, and continued her blockbuster Eras Tour. Kim K might be famous for being famous, but she is a billionaire from Skims, her shapewear brand that raised $270 million at a $4 billion valuation in 2023. She also has a skincare line, SKKN BY KIM, and a private equity firm, SKKY Partners. Crowned the world’s youngest self-made billionaire in 2022 before falling from the ranks amid market turmoil, Wang regained the title in May after announcing that his artificial intelligence unicorn Scale AI had raised $1 billion at a $13.8 billion valuation. Wang owns an estimated 15% of the San Francisco-based firm. Ford sold his stake in his eponymous fashion brand to Estee Lauder in 2022 in a $2.8 billion deal. Since then, he’s put a big chunk of that fortune into an impressive real estate portfolio worth an estimated $200 million. The wunderkind sold his virtual reality company, Oculus VR, to Meta for $2 billion in cash and stock in 2014, at age 21. His latest venture: Anduril Industries, a defense firm that was valued by private investors at $8.5 billion in 2022. Though best known for his music, Shawn Carter made much of his fortune in alcohol. He sold a 50% stake in his champagne empire Armand de Brignac to LVMH in 2021, then sold the majority of his cognac brand D’Usse to Barcardi in 2023. Winfrey dropped off The Forbes 400 in 2021 and hasn’t made it back, though she’s still one of America’s richest self-made women, thanks to the reinvested profits from her show and films.

Title: Harris’s economic plan helps, but doesn’t get to the root of middle-class discontent

Hans Taparia is a clinical professor at New York University Stern School of Business. Bruce Buchanan is the C.W. Nichols Professor of Business Ethics and professor of marketing at New York University Stern School of Business. Like any candidate seeking reelection, President Joe Biden ran on his economic record: millions of new jobs created, steady GDP growth, inflation tamed, and new legislation allocating trillions of dollars for climate technology, semiconductors, and infrastructure. Kamala Harris aims to build on this record with child tax credits, down payment assistance for first-time home buyers, tax breaks for small businesses, modest tax increases for the wealthy, and a federal ban on price gouging for groceries. Her plan certainly helps—but none of these policy proposals address the root cause of discontent among the middle class: Wealth creation in America today defies gravity and always flows to the top. Despite recent economic indicators, the quality of life for much of America has been diminishing for decades. Since 1970, the share of income held by the middle class has dropped by a third while the share of income held by the wealthy has nearly doubled. Over the same span, the minimum wage, unchanged since 2007, has lost roughly half its purchasing power. Over 39 million workers, or 23% of the working population, make less than $17 per hour. Over 50% of American households earn less than $75,000, which, based on one study, is what the average family of three in the U.S. needs to earn to cover the costs of its basic needs. Simply put, America is hurting. At the core of the problem is that over the past half-century, American society has been reorganized, both legally and culturally, to put the interests of investors above all others—a state of affairs we call “the investor monoculture.” Today, about 80% of public company stock is owned by institutional investors—the likes of Berkshire Hathaway, BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, KKR, and Blackstone. In 1980, this number was just 29%. Such investors tend to operate with one objective: to seek maximum profits, regardless of the harm it may cause society. Such harm usually comes at the expense of workers, customers, and communities—and explains much of the malaise and inchoate rage that plagues America. Today’s extreme profits are being generated in two ways. The first is through cost cutting, which usually means eliminating workers, outsourcing jobs, and lowering wages. Going forward, technological advancement and the artificial intelligence revolution promise to make this worse. The second is a relentless drive for revenue growth, regardless of its effects on society or the planet. For instance, food companies have been supersizing and ultra-processing their products for decades, making a poor diet the leading cause of mortality. Suicide rates for young people are up more than 60% since 2007, but investor pressure pushes technology companies to keep users hooked to their screens for as long as possible. But none of this is the investor’s concern. The investor monoculture serves the richest 10% of households, who hold over 90% of corporate stock, and whose incomes exceed $250,000. It has been the dominant political influence in the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government since the Reagan administration—lowering taxes on corporations and the wealthy, diminishing the social safety net, frustrating the efforts of organized labor, and pushing back on market regulation. And in recent years, it has put hundreds of pro-investor judges on the federal bench, and a supermajority of six conservative justices on the Supreme Court. The Biden-Harris administration’s attempts to correct this situation have been sincere, but don’t get to the root of the problem. The Biden CHIPS and Science Act provides tens of billions in funding and incentives for American semiconductor manufacturers. But chip manufacturers aren’t large employers, and the biggest beneficiary of these funds will be, yes, the investors in those corporations. Harris just announced a plan for $100 billion in tax credits for companies in strategic industries such as biotechnology, aerospace, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. Once again, it will be the venture capitalists and other large investors in these companies who reap most of the benefits. To materially change our country’s trajectory, a new paradigm is required. Corporations must be redesigned such that everyday people (the bottom 90%) have a more equitable stake and say in corporations. In other words, we need to shift the ownership and governance of corporations away from current investors and toward stakeholders such as employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and the planet. Here’s a set of ideas that can be implemented without any new legislation or funding. This year, the U.S. government will spend $6.5 trillion, or 23% of GDP. Much of this is transfer payments, but trillions of dollars are general expenditures. This represents formidable spending power that can be leveraged to compel corporations to share government-generated wealth more fairly with communities and stakeholders. What if the corporations receiving government funds through the CHIPS and Science Act were required to share ownership rights or profits with the communities in which they build factories? What if the government gave preference to employee-owned businesses, or stipulated profit sharing with stakeholders, for its purchases of goods and services? What if it mandated that, instead of being owned by private equity players looking to return multiples on their investments, all hospice services receiving Medicare funds be substantively owned by nonprofits or the people providing the hospice care? What would that do for the caregivers? What would it do for the care? Or imagine the pride and dedication of construction workers who share in the ownership and profits of firms building government projects. Each year, the U.S. government lends hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations through agencies such as the Small Business Administration, the USDA, and the Department of Energy. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Department of Energy alone will lend over $400 billion to climate technology companies. The biggest gains from these loans will go to just a few investors. The U.S. government should stipulate higher levels of ownership, profit sharing, voting, and board rights for workers, communities, or other stakeholders in companies that participate in these programs. Such requirements would spread the benefits of these loans more broadly and give stakeholders a greater sense of economic agency and civic participation. Similarly, when state-funded universities or the National Institutes of Health license new drug discoveries or technology to corporations, they should require profit distribution that flows not just to investors but also to other stakeholders such as patients and caregivers. Imagine if patients shared in the profits from sky-high drug prices. Redesigning corporations to benefit stakeholders and communities using existing market-based approaches presents endless possibilities. The force of government spending and investment applied in this way would foster hope among the 90% who are marginalized by the investor monoculture and begin a process of political healing. America is hurting. Democrats must acknowledge and address this pain. The investor monoculture is at the root of the problem—and government-encouraged corporate redesign is one viable path to recovery. We already have the tools to do this. The question is whether we have the political will.

Title: Circle partners with Mark Carnegie to bring USDC to Australia

Share this article Circle has announced plans to bring its USDC stablecoin to Australia through a partnership with venture capitalist Mark Carnegie’s MHC Digital Group, signaling an expansion into the Asia Pacific region. The collaboration aims to increase USDC distribution and explore institutional use cases in Australia and beyond. MHC Digital Group, with offices in Australia and Singapore, will provide USDC access to wholesale clients across Australia. Circle’s Chief Business Officer Kash Razzaghi highlighted the region’s potential, noting its young, mobile-first population and digital wallet readiness. The partnership could help Australian superannuation funds avoid bank fees and may lead to the creation of an Australian dollar stablecoin in the future. This expansion follows Circle’s recent moves, including relocating its headquarters to New York City’s One World Trade Center ahead of a planned IPO valued at around $5 billion. The company has also made USDC available to investors in Mexico and Brazil through the banking system and became the first global stablecoin issuer licensed to offer dollar- and euro-pegged tokens in the European Union. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin behind Tether’s USDT, currently has a market cap of $35 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $7.87 billion. The partnership with MHC Digital Group represents another step in Circle’s global expansion strategy, potentially bringing stablecoin technology to a broader audience in the Asia Pacific region. In September, Circle partnered with Sony Block Solutions Labs to integrate USDC on Sony’s Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, Soneium, aiming to transform digital finance and entertainment transactions. Earlier this year, Circle implemented smart contract support for BlackRock BUIDL holders, enabling them to transfer shares for USDC, streamlining blockchain transactions and reducing costs. Beyond native L2s, Circle has also expanded its Web3 services to the Solana blockchain, enhancing USDC accessibility for developers and enterprises with improved on-chain transaction management and secure wallet integration.

Title: Five Stocks to Watch in October—and What to Watch For

The major indexes are trading near record highs after the Fed's rate cut fueled a rebound from a shaky start to September. Looking ahead at specific companies, October brings a major product launch from one of the Magnificent Seven and earnings reports from key companies in the tech, banking, and apparel industries. Below, we look at five stocks that could lead market trends—and see big price movements—in October. Tesla (TSLA) will kick off October with third-quarter delivery data early in the month. But investors may watch another event even more closely: a robotaxi launch scheduled for Oct. 10. The event, which CEO Elon Musk has said will be the most important moment for Tesla since it unveiled the Model 3 in 2016, will likely feature a prototype of the robotaxi model, dubbed “Cybercab.” It will also be an opportunity for the automaker to showcase its investments in artificial intelligence and its progress on full self-driving (FSD) software. Analysts have speculated that Tesla stock could get a lift if the company offers aggressive estimates of how quickly it can roll out robotaxis, the size of the market, or its timeline for achieving unsupervised FSD. Tesla stock has risen about 5% so far this year. Microsoft (MSFT) could set the tone for big tech earnings this quarter when it reports mid-month. While the company announced a date just yet, some market watchers expect that its earnings will drop after the bell on Oct. 22, the same day Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL) is expected to report. Microsoft is one of four trillion-dollar tech companies—including Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—engaged in an expensive artificial intelligence arms race. Microsoft spent nearly $14 billion on property and equipment in the quarter ended June 30, a 55% increase from the same year-ago period. Much of that spending was on the chips, servers, and other equipment needed to run the company’s AI-powering data centers. Big Tech's spending spooked some corners of Wall Street, which fueled a string of dramatic tech sell-offs in July. Chatter about AI spending has since abated, but Microsoft and its big tech peers have, unlike the broader market, yet to fully rebound from their summer slump. (Still, Microsoft shares are up 14% this year.) Microsoft’s upcoming report has the potential to recast the spotlight on big tech’s spending or give Wall Street a taste of the payoff the company has assured them is coming. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the world's largest non-state-owned bank, could give investors a glimpse of what Fed rate cuts mean for American banks when it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 11. JPMorgan shares tanked in early September after one executive warned that net interest income (NII), the difference between what the bank earns on loans and what it pays on deposits, was likely to be lower in 2025 than previously forecast. That warning came just days before the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points, which it is expected to follow up with a string of cuts stretching into next year. Lower interest rates will weigh on JPMorgan’s NII, but they will also take some of the pressure off borrowers who otherwise might have defaulted on loans. Bank of America analysts think banks are better prepared to weather this rate-cutting cycle than any in recent memory. Plus, lower rates in the context of a soft landing—an outcome some economists say is looking increasingly likely—should spur loan demand, reinvigorate mortgage lending, and boost trading activity, all bonuses for banks. The analysts, though, conceded that it's easier to calculate how much rate cuts will reduce NII than how much they’ll boost revenue. JPMorgan’s quarterly results could shed some light on that trade-off and move the stock, which is up 24% since the start of the year. Nike (NKE) will report results for the first quarter of its 2025 fiscal year on Oct. 1. and it will be the shoe retailer’s last report before incoming CEO Elliott Hill takes the reins on Oct. 14. The CEO transition marks the beginning of a new phase of Nike’s turnaround efforts. The company has been struggling for some time with sluggish sales in China, once considered its largest growth opportunity, and loss of market share to upstart rivals like On (ONON) and Deckers-owned (DECK) Hoka. Nike shares had their worst day on record after its most recent earnings report in June when the company forecast sales would decline by 10% in the fiscal first quarter. The stock plummeted 20% that day and, even after rebounding slightly, are down some 18% this year. As such, expectations aren’t exactly high heading into October’s report. Deutsche Bank analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect the company to reiterate its full-year guidance and indicate that sales declines had bottomed. “We think a narrative of improvement will be well received,” they wrote, adding that Hill’s appointment gave them confidence the company would refocus on “product innovation, marketing/storytelling, and rebuilding wholesale partnerships.” It has been a wild couple of months for chip giant Intel (INTC). Once the world’s most valuable chipmaker, its shares have shed more than 50% of their value this year as disappointing demand for its foundry services and the high cost of developing AI chips have saddled the company with billions of dollars of losses. Things have looked up a bit in recent weeks. Shares surged in mid-September after the company said it would restructure its foundry business. They were boosted just days later by reports of a possible acquisition by Qualcomm (QCOM) and a $5 billion investment from Apollo Global Management. had approached the company to discuss an acquisition. In October, investors will be looking for more evidence that Intel has the funds, or can raise the funds, to sustain investments in its manufacturing business. Those funds could from the federal government, with which Intel is reportedly working overtime to secure $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding before the end of the year. And some investors may still be hoping for transformational M&A.

Amid a spate of executive resignations and reports that it’s spending more than it’s making, OpenAI is reportedly preparing to close a $6.5 billion funding round that could value the artificial intelligence startup at $150 billion. Thrive Capital is reported to be leading the round, and tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are reportedly involved in talks too. Apple (AAPL), which has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its iPhone operating system, recently dropped out of talks to participate in the funding round, The Wall Street Journal reported. As OpenAI looks for investors for its multi-billion dollar round, it is also talking to investors about restructuring its non-profit status to attract investors, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. And as it considers a for-profit structure, chief executive Sam Altman has reportedly told employees he doesn’t plan to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. During a meeting with Altman and Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s chief financial officer, both leaders told employees that the company’s investors are concerned over Altman not having equity, CNBC reported. Here are the companies expected to invest in OpenAI’s $6.5 billion funding round. Venture capital firm Thrive Capital is reportedly leading OpenAI’s funding round and investing over $1 billion. Thrive has invested $750 million into the round, and plans to use a special purpose vehicle to add $450 million more from other investors, The New York Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Thrive did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tiger Global, a venture capital firm, is reportedly investing an unclear amount of money into OpenAI. In 2021, Tiger purchased $125 million in shares of OpenAI, The Information reported. The firm was also part of a group of investors that pushed for Altman to be reinstated after he was fired from the startup in November. Tiger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. United Arab Emirates-backed investment fund MGX is reportedly participating in the funding round. MGX, which was launched by the U.A.E. in March to invest in AI projects, hasn’t decided the size of its potential investment, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. G42, a state-backed AI company, and the U.A.E.’s wealth fund, Mubadala Investment, are founding partners of the investment fund. MGX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Khosla Ventures, which has previously invested in OpenAI, is expected to invest in the round through a special purpose vehicle, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Instead of using money from its venture funds, Khosla plans to raise money from limited partners, the people said. Khosla Ventures did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SoftBank (SFTBY) Vision Fund is investing $500 million in the funding round, The Information reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The investment would be the venture capital fund’s largest in a generative AI startup. In July, SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son blocked an investment into French AI startup Mistral to avoid issues with OpenAI, an unnamed person told The Information. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Microsoft, which has already invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, is reportedly in talks to participate in its latest funding round. Microsoft declined to comment. Nvidia, which designs the chips that power some of the world’s most powerful AI models, has discussed investing around $100 million in OpenAI, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Nvidia declined to comment.

The stock plummeted 20% that day and, even after rebounding slightly, are down some 18% this year. As such, expectations aren’t exactly high heading into October’s report. Deutsche Bank analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect the company to reiterate its full-year guidance and indicate that sales declines had bottomed. “We think a narrative of improvement will be well received,” they wrote, adding that Hill’s appointment gave them confidence the company would refocus on “product innovation, marketing/storytelling, and rebuilding wholesale partnerships.” It has been a wild couple of months for chip giant Intel (INTC). Once the world’s most valuable chipmaker, its shares have shed more than 50% of their value this year as disappointing demand for its foundry services and the high cost of developing AI chips have saddled the company with billions of dollars of losses. Things have looked up a bit in recent weeks. Shares surged in mid-September after the company said it would restructure its foundry business. They were boosted just days later by reports of a possible acquisition by Qualcomm (QCOM) and a $5 billion investment from Apollo Global Management. had approached the company to discuss an acquisition. In October, investors will be looking for more evidence that Intel has the funds, or can raise the funds, to sustain investments in its manufacturing business. Those funds could from the federal government, with which Intel is reportedly working overtime to secure $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding before the end of the year. And some investors may still be hoping for transformational M&A.

On Tuesday, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META) stock received a Buy rating from Pivotal Research, with a new price target set at $780. The research firm highlighted Meta's status as the leading social media company worldwide, citing its substantial daily active user base of 3.3 billion across its platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Reels, Stories, and Facebook Messenger. Pivotal Research commended Meta's management for its proven track record in developing new products and enhancements, particularly in response to competitors. The firm anticipates robust revenue growth for Meta, driven by increased usage, the introduction of new products, improved targeting, and higher pricing. This growth is expected to be further supported by cost efficiencies gained through artificial intelligence and a significant reduction in Reality Labs' losses. The research firm's outlook for Meta is bolstered by what it considers an attractive valuation. Meta's earnings per share (EPS) for 2025 are valued at approximately 24 times, and when factoring out 90% of Reality Labs' losses, the valuation is closer to 19 times EPS. Pivotal Research expressed confidence in CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ability to steer Meta successfully in an ever-evolving world propelled by rapid advancements in AI. The endorsement from Pivotal Research underscores Meta's potential for increased profitability and market dominance. With its array of popular social media platforms and ongoing innovations, Meta appears well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities presented by AI and the digital landscape. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has been a focal point of several analyst updates and regulatory news. Monness, Crespi, Hardt raised Meta's 12-month price target to $620, maintaining a Buy rating due to the company's AI and metaverse potential. Rosenblatt Securities also increased its price target for Meta to $811, citing strength in AI and VR/AR. Meanwhile, Meta was hit with a €91 million fine by Ireland's Data Protection Commission for a security lapse involving user password storage. Oppenheimer maintained its Outperform rating on Meta following the company's annual "Meta Connect" developer event, which showcased technological advances, including a lower-cost mixed-reality headset and updates to its AI capabilities. Furthermore, Stifel reiterated a Buy rating on Meta, expressing confidence in the company's AI focus. These are among the recent developments in Meta's business landscape. As a reminder, this article reports on recent news and does not make any predictions or personal opinions. The information provided is based on past articles and is intended to offer a snapshot of recent events involving Meta Platforms Inc. Meta Platforms' strong market position, as highlighted by Pivotal Research, is further supported by recent financial data and insights from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization stands at an impressive $1.45 trillion, reflecting its dominant status in the social media landscape. InvestingPro data reveals that Meta's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 reached $149.78 billion, with a robust revenue growth of 24.28% over the same period. This aligns with Pivotal Research's expectations of strong revenue growth driven by increased usage and new product introductions. The company's financial health is underscored by two key InvestingPro Tips. Firstly, Meta "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet," indicating a strong financial position. Secondly, it boasts "impressive gross profit margins," with the latest data showing a gross profit margin of 81.49% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. These factors contribute to Meta's ability to invest in innovation and AI advancements, as noted in the Pivotal Research analysis. Meta's valuation metrics also support the research firm's outlook. The company's P/E ratio (adjusted) stands at 26.86, which, when considered alongside its growth prospects, suggests a potentially attractive valuation. This is further reinforced by an InvestingPro Tip stating that Meta is "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth."

Title: How To Address The Global Talent Shortage?

75% of employers worldwide are struggling to find the talent they need. In Agreus Group's article 2024 predictions for the family office space, I touched upon a significant ongoing global challenge: a widespread shortage of skilled professionals. The 2023 ManpowerGroup Talent Shortage Study indicates that 75% of employers worldwide are struggling to find the talent they need. This difficulty spans several sectors, with accounting, financial services and investment roles facing some of the most pronounced shortages. Family offices must strategically contend with large corporations for this sought-after talent. Understanding the Global Talent Shortage The global job market today offers skilled professionals a plethora of career choices, presenting a challenge for those seeking to recruit the best. There is a particularly acute shortage of finance and accounting expertise. Avalara’s research reveals that 84% of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) surveyed in the United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (U.K.) face a significant talent shortage within their teams. Family offices often require high-calibre talent in specialised areas such as accounting, financial services and investment, where specific expertise is essential for managing complex portfolios for Ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) families. According to the 2023 BlackRock Global Family Office Survey, 40% of family offices see talent sourcing as a major hurdle in achieving their investment goals. Identifying and retaining top talent has become a major challenge for family offices worldwide. Strategies to Address the Talent Gap With intense competition in attracting top professionals, family offices must differentiate themselves. We recommend a well-rounded strategy to effectively tackle this talent shortage: Competitive Compensation Packages As an expert in the family office recruitment space, we know compensation plays a huge part in attracting and retaining talent. Professionals are often drawn to family offices from sectors where competitive compensation is standard. To engage and keep such talent, it is crucial to offer compensation that is on par with the industry standard, ensuring they match what these individuals may have received from their prior roles. Our 2023 Global Family Office Compensation Benchmark Report is an invaluable resource for benchmarking against other family offices and staying competitive in the market. Explore the Global Talent Pool Expanding your hiring criteria can be an effective strategy to tackle the talent shortage. One way to do this is by leveraging global recruitment and considering job seekers from other countries. With increased global mobility, family offices can have a more varied skill set from an extended talent pool. This will ultimately increase your chances of finding highly qualified candidates and filling vacancies successfully. Flexible Work Arrangements Embracing flexible work arrangements, such as remote work and flexible hours, can broaden the pool of potential candidates and improve employee satisfaction. Remote work also allows you to extend your reach beyond borders, which can help you overcome local skill gaps and save money in the process. Professional Development Opportunities Investing in employee development helps to build a positive work environment, enhances retention, and keeps your family office in the know with the latest developments. It is also a proactive approach to tackling the global talent shortage. The global talent shortage is undoubtedly a critical challenge for family offices worldwide. Family offices must implement a comprehensive strategy to effectively compete for top-tier professionals in the fierce market. By prioritising the strategies discussed above, family offices can attract and retain the skilled talent necessary to achieve their long-term goals.

Title: Open source is not a trust issue, it’s an innovation issue

Time Published: 2024-10-01T07:17:00Z

Dmitry Nikolaev - stock.adobe.co No project is smooth sailing all the way. So perhaps it was appropriate that the Open Source Summit Europe kicked off amid some of the worst storms in memory, before finishing in clear blue skies and warm autumnal sunshine. The Linux Foundation-backed conference saw a raft of product announcements and initiatives, among which was the rolling together of distributed trust projects – including blockchain, ledger, identity and cryptographic efforts – into an LF Foundation Decentralised Trust. The Linux Foundation announced general availability of Valkey 8.0, the open source in-memory database project forked from Redis earlier this year, after the eponymous company behind the in-memory database changed its licence. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) donated the OpenSearch project to the Linux Foundation. The cloud giant launched the OpenSearch project in response to Elastic’s licence switch on ElasticSearch back in 2021. At the same time, the Linux Foundation and its mighty offshoot the Cloud Native Computing Foundation have partnered with Unified Patents to “defend open source software from non-practising entities”, by which they mean patent trolls. But while the “ecosystem” looks in rude health, what is happening in the community? Or more to the point, how are businesses really using and benefiting from open source software? The Linux Foundation’s Open source maturity in Europe report paints a robust picture, stating that between 2022 and 2024, “more than half of the respondents each year reported seeing an increased business value from using OSS compared to the previous year”. For this year, it revealed that just under two-thirds reported a rise in business value from the year before. “This indicates a compounding effect, where the value derived from open source software grows each year. Similarly, the benefits from contributions are also on the rise, with 52% of respondents in recent surveys reporting increased benefits compared to prior years,” said the report. Those benefits include increased productivity, cited by 62%, catalysed innovation (61%) and reduced operating costs (60%). Critically, over three-quarters believed open source software to be more secure than closed source software. But the research also found that resistant organisational cultures were a brake on open source adoption, particularly “in sectors traditionally resistant to openness, such as finance”. It added: “Open source is often mistakenly viewed as merely a technical matter, when in fact, it is a cultural change – it is a change maker and needs to be approached in a multidimensional strategy.” Achieving that cultural change can be critical when it comes to dealing with an increasingly volatile world, where organisations need to constantly innovate just to survive. In a panel on lessons from vertical industries, Mercedes-Benz open source programme lead Wolfgang Gehring said a modern vehicle was a datacentre on wheels, so “innovation and software [mean] open source”, and when it comes to common problems, “you can collaborate with other companies in the industry in open source”. Before open source, he added, “that was much more difficult”. On the same panel, Karel Rietveld, Open Source Program Office lead at the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration, said motivations and inhibitions could be slightly different in the public sector, with different regulations and layers of management and compliance to be aware of. Open source might be more cost effective, a big issue for cash-strapped public entities, he added, but there was also the cost of publicly funded time and people to consider. But, of course, these are the already converted, and it might be argued that many critical sectors will continue to have an instinctive distrust of open source and be extremely unwilling to embed it in their systems. A glib response might be that few companies are not taking advantage of open source in some form anyway. That might be the CEO’s Android phone. Or it could be their use of cloud technologies or services which rely on a cloud native stack predicated on containers and Kubernetes, and open source security tools, and open source-powered developer workflows. For all the talk about community, sometimes it’s more base common interest that will drive a company or a sector to use open source. Finance is generally secretive, but increasingly is adopting open source. That’s not necessarily for any utopian ideals. Rather, banks and other financial institutions will have common problems to code for, in the shape of compliance with regulations for example, so it makes sense from an efficiency point of view to find common answers to these problems. Gabriele Columbro, who heads up both the Linux Foundation Europe and the Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS), said if anything, financial services are ahead of “other traditional industries in their adoption and strategic understanding of open source”. The sector is already highly tech-centric, he said, with banks potentially employing tens of thousands of developers. “And not only the big banks – we have the buy sides, Blackrock, Fidelity, five or six buy side members, and everyone in between. The clearing houses started coming in … so the whole ecosystem is starting to harmonise around open standards and open source.” The power sector is another “conservative” industry that is increasingly relying on open source as it races to rebuild its systems and infrastructure to meet the climate change challenge. This requires new ways of managing and predicting demand, and that means new tools – fast. As with finance, all operators face these problems, making cooperation easier to contemplate. Jonas van den Bogaard, open source lead at Dutch power distribution company Alliander, and a member of the technical advisory council at LF Energy, said the power distribution sector in Holland – likes its counterparts worldwide – is racing to decarbonise the grid and underpin electrification. As well as building out physical capacity, this will require much better tools for management and forecasting. “We are actively searching for collaboration and partnerships with industry players – with vendors, both academia and also cross-sector – to bundle resources, knowledge and expertise to realise these new digital integrations,” he said. “We’ve seen open source more as one of the means to make this possible, and it has been very successful for building up several capabilities.” And power is not the only critical infrastructure that will be relying on open source. Timo Perala heads up Nokia’s open source projects office, having previously worked in standards. Ultimately, he said, its customers want products and services that work – they are not necessarily concerned whether they include open source elements, just as they wouldn’t necessarily care where Nokia sourced components like buts and bolts. Moreover, open source collaboration is a form of shared research and development, where everyone needs to solve a problem without necessarily capitalising on the solution. Perala likened it to how companies agree on a handover on a mobile network. “That is something that you just can’t charge for ... it’s a basic requirement, not a competitive advantage,” he said. It’s hard to think of more conservative industries than power, finance and telecoms. But they are also industries that are facing high levels of disruption and a corresponding need to innovate quickly. If they’re building their businesses on open source, the only reason the rest of the world hasn’t is because they’re not being confronted with the same level of potential disruption. Yet. As Mercedes’ Gehring told his audience: “Innovation nowadays happens in open source. Innovation in software happens in open source. And you’re either there and you participate, or you’re not. That’s basically it.”

Title: Gerry Thornley: Corinthians find their path by putting faith in youth

All has changed, changed utterly in grassroots rugby. Few games on the opening day of the Energia All-Ireland League season last Saturday week illustrated this more than newly-promoted Corinthians’ trip to Ballymena. They come from different provinces and for much of the AIL’s 34-year history from different worlds. Ballymena’s list of grandees includes Willie John McBride, Syd Millar and Trevor Ringland, among others. They were one of the initial nine clubs in the inaugural Division 1 when the AIL was formed in 1990-91. Save for a two-year stay in Division 2, Ballymena remained a top-tier club until 2009 and were champions in 2003 when beating Clontarf in the final. They have oscillated between the second and third tiers ever since. Corinthians have had their notable past players too, including Noel Mannion and Johnny O’Connor, and technically Mack Hansen is among their number too and has illuminated Corinthians Park with his off-field presence this season. However, the Galway club began AIL life in Division 2 and lasted only one season before being relegated back to the Connacht Senior League. They rejoined an expanded AIL in Division 3 in 1993-94 but were relegated to Division 4 the following season. The two clubs remained three and two divisions apart for 14 seasons before meeting for the first time in April 2011 in 1B (the second tier) when Corinthians beat Ballymena 29-27, although that didn’t stop the latter being promoted. Like ships passing in the night, Corinthians moved a division above Ballymena in 2013-14 in 1B for one year only and the following season they rubbed shoulders a second time. Promoted Ballymena won 20-0 at Eaton Park in September 2014 and the sides drew in Corinthian Park the following December as Corinthians were relegated. And that was it until last Saturday week, on foot of Corinthians winning promotion from 2B last season via the play-offs. But the novelty value of the fixture didn’t stop there. The average age of the Corinthians match-day squad was 19 years and 11 months, yet they returned from Eaton Park with a 27-10 bonus-point win. Last Saturday, an even younger Corinthians hosted Greystones, whose alumni include the late, great Paul McNaughton, as well as Tony Ward, Nick Popplewell and more. Although Greystones soon became a Division 1 club after also starting life with Corinthians in Division 2 the two are familiar foes. Greystones won 2B a couple of seasons ago, with Corinthians second. After a small lunch hosted by club president Roy Gibson in McHugh’s across the road, on a lovely sunny afternoon near Claregalway, props Billy Bohan, Fiachna Barrett, eye-catching 19-year-old flanker Max Flynn, classy outhalf Sean Naughton and left-winger James Nicholson (himself a Greystones lad) were all released from the Connacht academy and recalled. Including centre John Devine, younger brother of scrumhalf Matthew, this quintet are also current or recent Irish under-20s, while replacement scrumhalf Tomás Farthing is another in the Connacht academy. Conceivably one of the university clubs has fielded younger sides, but Corinthians’ youthful spirit is extraordinary for a club with no university affiliations. Perhaps it’s the mature head on him, his leadership qualities seeing him become club captain in just his second season, but Mark Boyle stands out as the old man of the team. And he’s only 23. The number eight was released by the Leinster academy and, after also being rejected by Connacht, he contemplated retiring as so many of his age do if denied a path into the professional game. But, living in Galway and working for Aviva, he is loving life and rugby more than ever. His older brother Paul was a replacement in Connacht’s 36-30 comeback win over the Sharks later that night, which made for a long day in Galway for their fortunate Dublin-based dad “Pablo”. Boyle hails the attention to detail of head coach Michael Harding as well as forwards coach Pat Cunningham and backs coach JJ Hanrahan. Harding will have a detailed breakdown of every player’s performance on their phones by 8pm on match night. Hanrahan, availing of his ACL injury to make his first foray into coaching, describes working with such talented young backs as “a dream”, while they must feel likewise given his knowledge. As the watching ex-Corinthians and Connacht outhalf Ciaran Smyth puts it, making hay, and scoring tries, while the sun shines before the wet days of winter is imperative for this young side. After a break from their own 22 by their Welsh centre Tom Waters (20), Barrett finished strongly inside four minutes. Naughton also converted their second try by 19-year-old lock Bryan Walsh, who has previously been donated size 16 boots by Connacht’s Pro12-winning lock Ally Muldownwey. As well as a howitzer of a boot, Naughton is creator-in-chief, with his ability to take the ball to the line, passing range off both hands and cross kicks. Corinthians sealed a bonus point by half-time through Sean Fox and Flynn. After a rally by Greystones and a try by centre Andrew Lynch, Corinthians finished strongly, with Naughton (20) and Fox (19) combining for full-back Orin Burke (19) to score before Charlie Leonard is driven over. Corinthians’ 40-10 win leaves them in a four-way tie atop 2A alongside Barnhall, Instonians and Cashel. Early days, and they won’t always have their academy stardust. But what makes their success just as impressive is that last weekend they also fielded two under-20 sides. This is at a time when under-20 sides in Irish clubs are in alarming decline. Their under-20s “firsts” beat their Blackrock counterparts 27-17 away on Sunday to seal promotion to the Leinster first division with two long-range tries by Walsh’s younger brother Sean, another Irish under-20 international, while their seconds beat Galwegians in the Connacht under-20 final. The driving force for this depth at under-20 level is largely attributed to the work of club stalwart John “Stack” Noone.

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF, also known as ETHA, has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management (AUM). “It’s very rare that you see an ETF get to a billion AUM in seven weeks, as ETHA did,” said Mitchnick, speaking at the Messari Mainnet conference in New York this week. “In most cases, it takes multiple years to never for a new ETF to get to a billion.” Launched in July following the SEC’s surprising approval, it took ETHA less than a month to reach $1 billion in net inflows. As of September 30, ETHA’s Ethereum holdings exceeded 380,601 ETH, valued at around $1 billion. Source: ishares.com Despite lagging behind BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which amassed $2 billion in AUM within just 15 days of its launch, ETHA is still among the world’s top performing crypto ETFs. The stagnant performance is not entirely unexpected for BlackRock and other ETF experts. Mitchnick believes that the investment story and narrative for Ethereum are “less easy” for investors to “digest.” “So that’s a big part of why we’re so committed to the education journey that we’re on with a lot of our clients,” he explained. BlackRock’s head of digital assets said that he did not expect ETHA to ever reach the same level of flows and AUM as IBIT, but saw the current performance as a “good start.” Speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 convention in Nashville in July, Mitchnick said the company’s client base is primarily interested in Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum. There is “very little” demand for crypto ETFs beyond the two leading crypto assets, he noted. For BlackRock, Bitcoin and Ethereum offer complementary benefits, rather than competing for the same role. Mitchnick predicted that investors would allocate 20% of their crypto holdings to Ethereum and the remaining 80% to Bitcoin. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Powering Data Centers Is A Herculean Task
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/30/powering-data-centers-is-a-herculean-task/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T02:02:58Z

There are numerous ways to invest in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) boom. Some high flying chip stocks like Nvidia have captured the spotlight, but there are more ways to invest in a broad wave of AI adoption than just semiconductor chips. Chips are essential, but without the infrastructure to support them they’re useless. Investors should also consider the sector powering the data centers needed for AI development. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, data centers are forecasted to consume up to 9% of US electricity generation per year by 2030, up from 4% in 2023. That doesn’t sound like much, but between replacing old power generation and turning on new power arrays, the step up is significant. The reason is AI. The energy needs for AI computing are immense. To put the energy consumption into perspective, AI queries – just asking ChatGPT to clean up that email to your boss – can require approximately ten times the electricity of traditional internet searches. Training new models and running more complicated queries suck even more power. The need for more power generation is so intense that it’s actually becoming the primary obstacle for companies looking to innovate in AI. The ideas are there, the computational chips are expensive, but they’re there, but you need to figure out how to meet the energy needs for the data center to function. As this space continues to play out, we think it’s worth exploring opportunities within energy generation where investors can benefit from partnerships between both the upstream and downstream players in the AI market. This picture taken on January 23, 2023 in Toulouse, southwestern France, shows screens displaying ... [+] the logos of OpenAI and ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a conversational artificial intelligence software application developed by OpenAI. (Photo by Lionel BONAVENTURE / AFP) (Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images) To explore the first-phase beneficiaries providing key inputs for AI advancements, it’s worth breaking down what data centers are used for when it comes to artificial intelligence. Data centers are the backbone of this AI boom as they store the hardware necessary to train AI models. As modern technology companies have grown larger and larger, and the amount of equipment needed to maintain operations and cloud services has skyrocketed, the energy demand from hyperscalers has followed suit. Hyperscalers – companies that operate cloud computing infrastructure – provide the storage and compute power necessary to train AI and are faced with the difficult task of deciding where to source the energy needed for their daily operations. Major players within this space include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, all of which are forming partnerships with local utilities and power providers to ensure their energy demand is met. With the sweeping transition to cloud data storage, electricity demand has turned into the biggest problem facing the industry. Hyperscalers providing infrastructure and platform services just can’t get enough of it, and the world of institutional finance is taking advantage of the opportunity. As we’ve seen recently, Blackrock teamed up with Microsoft (MSFT) and MGX (an AI fund out of The United Arab Emirates) to announce the launch of a $30 billion AI infrastructure investment fund focusing on building out data centers and energy infrastructure. While this may seem like a massive investment initially, it pales in comparison to the total investment in AI from the top 5 hyperscalers over the next few years. For context, current projections indicate the investment levels will reach a combined $1 trillion in 2027 according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The way power is generated and sold to large hyperscale consumers is going to change. Whereas in the past many data centers may have tapped into local electrical grids, the future of data center electrification involves dedicated power construction and long term power purchase agreements (PPAs). Hyperscalers prefer PPAs over market spot pricing since they’re able to guarantee stable energy prices for an extended period, typically over ten years. This level of certainty provides a hedge against unwanted price fluctuations that would affect hyperscalers’ bottom line and put upward pressure on already substantial model training costs. Perhaps more important though is the desirability of long term contracts for developers and investors. PPAs from cash flush hyperscalers give developers the ability to secure financing for rapid construction of new power generation facilities. Knowing you have a reliable counter party allows for better profit forecasting! Furthermore, many of the power generation projects are dedicated solely to the data center and disconnected from the broader grid – a contract stipulating a minimum rate of return is essential for a project that takes years to break even and only has a single customer. Finally, it’s worth pointing out that while renewables like wind and solar are the preferred long term source of power for the data centers, the demand right now is high enough that other options are on the table too. Nuclear power is back in the spotlight and natural gas turbines offer rapid deployment. Each power source comes with pros and cons – some are more flexible and some are harder to ramp up and down with data center demand. There will be a wide variety of solutions to the power conundrum over the next several years and many solutions that start off as off grid or dedicated power supplies may eventually end up becoming part of the larger power system. NENTMANNSDORF, SAXONIA, GERMANY - 2012/09/04: Photovoltaik solar panels in a row at sunrise.. (Photo ... [+] by Frank Bienewald/LightRocket via Getty Images) The long term demand for electricity is an opportunity to accelerate the build out of clean energy solutions. The top hyperscalers have set ambitious goals to reduce their carbon footprints – renewable power is a must for them over longer time frames. Among the top names, Google is targeting to operate its data centers on carbon-free energy by 2030, and Microsoft and Amazon both hope to shift to 100% renewable energy by 2025. The massive undertaking is already underway as Microsoft (MSFT) and Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) signed the biggest-ever clean power deal this year for their data centers in the US and Europe, effectively penciling in 10.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity starting in 2026 and estimated to cost more than $10 billion. Keep in mind that 10.5 gigawatts is 3 times larger than the amount of electricity consumed by all data centers in Northern Virginia – commonly know as the data center capital of the world due to its favorable state tax incentives and best in-class access to power and internet connectivity. With the steadfast increase in renewable energy demand due to corporate mandates, there are several ways to invest. We’ve already touched on the financing side where groups like Blackrock or Brookfield are raising capital to fund the construction of new power projects. Then there’s the manufacturing side, companies that make solar panels or electrical components, or companies who build wind turbines like GE Vernova (GEV). Finally, there are the utilities who want to own and operate the power generation facitlities over the next several decades, companies like NextEra Energy (NEE) or Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG). Finally there are cutting edge innovations in the power space that are less proven. As an example, innovative nuclear technology, like small modular reactors, is progressing rapidly and has received extensive backing from the US Department of Energy. These new reactors, built by firms such as NuScale Power (SMR), are smaller than traditional reactors and don’t have to be custom-built on-site. The process of generating electricity through nuclear fission is the same, but the benefits include reduced construction time, enhanced passive safety features, greater flexibility in deployment, and more efficient fuel usage. For broad adoption with data centers in the US, we’ll need to see continued investment in generation capacity and regulatory compliance, so patience is key. CHANGJIANG, CHINA - AUGUST 10: Aerial view of the core module of China's Linglong One, the world's ... [+] first commercial small modular reactor (SMR), installed on August 10, 2023 in Changjiang Li Autonomous County, Hainan Province of China. Linglong One, which is self-developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation, was installed successfully in Hainan on August 10. (Photo by Luo Yunfei/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images) The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and pursuing energy demand are creating significant opportunities in the energy sector. As hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft ramp up their AI infrastructure, the need for massive amounts of electricity will drive investments in both traditional and renewable energy sources. While fossil fuels may provide immediate solutions due to existing infrastructure, the long-term focus is shifting toward renewables, such as wind, solar, and even nuclear power to meet sustainability goals. Well-established and innovative companies in the energy sector, especially those forming strategic partnerships with hyperscalers can offer an alternative method to invest in the AI market besides buying chip companies or hyperscalers directly, even if the full societal benefits of investment end up taking years to play out. The ongoing collaboration between energy and AI firms will be crucial for supporting AI adoption and addressing challenges that lie ahead. Regardless of any short-term uncertainties, the unrelenting demand for energy remains far from being satisfied, and investors should continue to monitor the space for opportunities. One Community.

Title: Focus On The Data To Avoid Future Bear Traps

Bear and bull in a trap. The stock market was able to rally last week despite the larger-than-expected 0.50% rate cut by the FOMC. As is often the case the averages gyrated after Fed Chair Powell's press conference and higher open the Dow Industrials closed down 293 points. Most will be happy that September is now over as the stock market had a rough start for the month as on September 3rd the S&P 500 gapped 25 points lower and closed down 2.1% while the Nasdaq Composite was down 3.1%. Nvidia Corp (NVDA) was down 9.5%. The selling accelerated for the next three days dropping to a low of 5402.62 which was a decline of 4.3% from the pre-labor day weekend close of 5649, point a. In my view, the drop was due in part to the widespread stock market commentary warning investors and traders of September’s poor seasonal track record. Therefore many were on the sidelines or short when the S&P reversed to the upside on September 11th, point b, in reaction to the CPI report. This I felt “ reflected an important change in the market outlook.” The bullish action of the advance/decline lines set the stage for the upside breakout in the S&P 500 in reaction to the FOMC announcement. My view of investing or trading based on seasonal tendencies was reiterated in 2015. “I have written many times in the past about seasonal tendencies and I have always stressed that one should only invest or trade a seasonal trend when the technical studies are in agreement.” Some investors and traders fail to recognize that comments like “the worst performance of any month” are mostly based on averages. In this case, going back to 1945. The unanimity of the commentary I think led to an oversized short position heading into September. Many who took a bearish bet would be surprised to learn that since 2006 the S&P 500 has had September gains of 2.46%, 3.58%, 3.68% and even up 8.71% in 2010. In fact, over the past seventeen years, it has been higher nine times. Exposure to this data may have kept some from selling their positions or buying puts based on the long-term averages. The lower close after the FOMC announcement had some prepared for heavier selling the next day. Instead, the overnight trading was very positive as the Spyder Trust (SPY Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ) opened 10 points higher or 100 points higher on the S&P 500. This was likely quite tough for those on the wrong side. Markets The bullish end to the week moved most of the averages higher led by the Dow Jones Transportation Average which was up 2.7%. It was followed by a 1.2% in the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD SPDR Gold Shares ) which was up 1.2% just barely stronger than the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) 1.1% gain. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up 0.6% while the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM iShares Russell 2000 ETF ) was down 0.2%. For the week on the NYSE, 1672 issues were advancing and just 1190 declined. NYSE Composite Monthly The data is still pointing higher as the monthly chart of the NYSE Composite completed a flag formation, lines a and b, in December of 2023. At the time both the NYSE Stocks Only Advance/Decline line and the NYSE All Advance/Decline were above their EMAs and therefore positive. In January of 2024, both advance/decline lines moved through their long-term resistance, lines c and d, which confirmed the positive price action. As we move into October both A/D lines are positive as they are well above their rising EMAs. The widening gap does mean they are getting overbought. In addition to the advance/decline data I also focus on the price and volume data. The price data determines the moving averages and I concentrate on the 20-period exponential moving averages (EMAs) on the monthly, weekly, daily, and even the hourly data. Invesco QQQ Trust The price data is used to determine the pivot levels as well as the starc bands. This weekly chart of the Invesco QQQ Invesco QQQ Trust Trust (QQQ) includes the yearly pivot levels for the past four years. These are based on the prior year's data. From early 2020 until early 2022 QQQ stayed above its pivot. In March 2023, QQQ closed back above the pivot and opened 2024 well above the yearly pivot at $358.78. The weekly Nasdaq 100 Advance/Decline line broke out above the long-term resistance, line b, in November of 2023 (point 3). It has been forming higher highs and higher lows since then as the decline in April 2024 held support before it again surged higher. The weekly relative performance (RS) is one of the key tools I use to determine whether SPY or the QQQ is going to be the best performer. The RS peaked in November 2021 and then dropped sharply. The RS support, line c, was broken in early 2022 (point 1) which indicated that QQQ was now lagging not leading the SPY. The RS downtrend, line d, favored the SPY over the QQQ in 2022. The break of this downtrend and the move above the rising EMA was a sign that QQQ was again leading the SPY. In 2023 the RS stayed above its EMA but it has crossed above and below it several times in 2024. Currently, the RS is below its EMA but rising. If the RS is now able to move back above its EMA that will be a sign that QQQ is again a market leader. Given the global risk factors and the upcoming election, I would not be surprised if there is a sharp 1-3% pullback or two in October. But the strong trend in the advance/decline lines is a positive factor for stocks after the election and into the end of the year. Going forward try to just use hard data in your decision-making process for investing or trading. Avoid making decisions based on any general market commentary, seasonal analysis, or the public investing stance of any large hedge fund. This will help you avoid future bear or bull traps.

Title: SoftBank to Invest $500M in OpenAI for the First Time—Is It Late to the Party?

SoftBank (SFTBF) is looking to invest in OpenAI for the first time. The Japanese conglomerate helmed by billionaire Masayoshi Son has reportedly agreed to chip in $500 million via its second Vision Fund in a round that values the ChatGPT maker at a staggering $150 billion, The Information reported today (Sept. 30). The round is set to be led by Thrive Capital, which is investing $1 billion. Other participants could include Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Tiger Global Management and the United Arab Emirates-backed fund MGX. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. SoftBank’s involvement would represent one of Son’s most significant bets on A.I. so far. It would also follow missteps made by the conglomerate’s first Vision Fund, which infamously backed WeWork and suffered heavy losses after its collapse in 2023. Until now, Son’s most notable A.I. investment has been SoftBank’s majority ownership of Arm, a U.K.-based chip designer. SoftBank in May reported a $4.6 billion gain for its Vision Funds for the fiscal year, largely driven by Arm’s 2023 IPO. In the past few years, the conglomerate has been on “defense mode,” said Son during SoftBank’s 2023 annual shareholder meeting last June. “Three years ago, we didn’t have a lot of cash on hand,” said Son at the time, noting that SoftBank has since amassed more than $35 billion. “We are ready to shift to offense mode,” he declared, adding his primary interest was playing a large role in the “A.I. revolution.” Besides partaking in an investment round for Perplexity AI, an A.I.-driven search engine, earlier this year, the company has largely taken a backseat to A.I. startups and reportedly passed on investments in OpenAI competitors like Mistral AI, Anthropic and Cohere. Its willingness to back OpenAI, however, should come as no surprise—Son has repeatedly sung the praises of the company, stating that he is a “heavy user of ChatGPT” and calling OpenAI CEO Sam Altman “one of the key people on Earth.” SoftBank and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment from Observer regarding SoftBank’s investment. SoftBank’s bet on OpenAI is quite late by venture capital standards, given its already colossal valuation. But the high-flying A.I. company still has room for growth, according to analysts. The company hit $3.4 billion in annualized revenue in June and is “progressing towards $5 billion in annual recurring revenue, driven primarily by its ChatGPT product,” Brendan Burke, PitchBook’s senior emerging technology analyst, told Observer via email. PitchBook estimates OpenAI is set to benefit from a generative A.I. software market that is on pace to double next year and exceed $30 billion, he added. “This revenue growth supports further valuation growth, which encourages employees to remain at the company and progresses toward the trillion-dollar valuation that CEO Sam Altman believed the company can grow into,” said Burke. SoftBank’s investment comes at a time of uncertainty for OpenAI. The company last week lost three top executives, and Altman is reportedly planning a restructuring that will change the company’s capped-profit model. “Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding,” said Altman in a post on X announcing the recent departures.

Title: How Meta’s Metaverse Bet Went From Awkward to Wow

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily With Meta’s Orion AR glasses, photorealistic virtual spaces and Puma’s mixed-reality shopping, fashion has a lot to ponder. Tech Reporter All of a sudden, virtual technology seems less like a fading fad and more like a viable wave of the future — and Meta, keeper of chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse dreams, must be thrilled. The major takeaway from the Meta Connect developer conference last week was that the company finally succeeded in building full holographic, augmented reality glasses, or at least a prototype. Though early, the implications matter because, as Zuckerberg sees it, this is the technology that will someday replace smartphones. But that just scratches the surface, especially for the fashion business. Because Meta also unleashed a slew of new reality-bending features and experiences that could change how brands operate and communicate in the near, not far-off, future. Related Articles Technology Tech Tuesdays: ChannelEngine Now on SAP Beauty Features Marla Beck on Her Plans for Hydrafacial Parent Company BeautyHealth Holographic AR Glasses You May Also Like Seven months after Apple launched its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, the Meta CEO surprised the crowd by showing off the Orion prototype. Forget bulky and heavy headsets, or holding up a smartphone screen. For Meta, stepping into an AR or MR experience will be a matter of putting on a pair of spectacles. This was always the goal of its EssilorLuxottica partnership. First, they created the Ray-Ban smart glasses, which continue to get smarter with evolving artificial intelligence features and expanded styles and colors, including a new transparent frame. Lessons learned along the way were then applied to the Ray-Ban’s bigger, techier cousin. And Orion is just that. The prototype is set in a thicker frame with beefier specs, including projection technology that can beam interactive visuals onto the lenses. It also features AI-powered voice control, eye- and hand-tracking — so users can select elements by reaching for or looking at them — as well as a wrist-based neural interface. Imagine designers collaborating on a new capsule collection using AR or MR, conceptualizing ideas together or tweaking virtual pieces in real time. With gestures, they can easily switch colors, bring up the hemline, add embellishments and do other things, and visually see the work progress — as if the item was physically on the table between them. Extend that to shopping, and it gives a whole new meaning to browsing products. Meta embarked on the Luxottica partnership four years ago, but the effort to build full-fledged holographic AR glasses goes back further. It started with the 2014 acquisition of virtual reality developer Oculus, which eventually became Meta’s Reality Labs division. So Zuckerberg has been talking about virtual experiences for 10 years, and specifically glasses-based AR for four years. Now with a tangible prototype — which isn’t Meta’s first, but it’s the first to be showcased publicly — the vision looks more than just feasible. It is actually on the way. “So with Orion we are getting closer to achieving the dream of Reality Labs, to create the next major computing platform that delivers a deep sense of presence — like you were right there with another person,” Zuckerberg explained. “This is where we are going.” The big reveal set off plenty of buzz in tech circles, but analysts seem mixed. While some are skeptical, others are so impressed, they actively wonder why the CEO started off by talking about Meta Quest, Ray-Ban and Meta AI updates instead of Orion. The answer should be obvious. This is Zuckerberg’s “One more thing” moment, echoing Steve Jobs’ penchant for saving the most exciting Apple debuts for last. Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post, who put a “buy” rating on Meta stock, told clients that interest will swirl around Orion more than the Quest headset. Perhaps someday. But for now, the Quest is an actual product circulating in the market, which is why the next item may be more immediately gratifying. Fashion, Meet Hyperscape According to Counterpoint Research, Meta already accounts for 74 percent of the global VR and AR market, as of the second quarter of 2024, and with a new budget headset, the Quest 3S, that number could jump even further. A cheaper device will surely please some consumers, but brands may be more intrigued by the new photorealistic avatars and environments coming to this and other models. “We call this Hyperscape,” said Zuckerberg, “and the way this works is, you can use your phone to scan a room and then recreate it, or you can step into a room that someone else has scanned and shared.” He then showcased visual artist Daniel Arsham’s studio in New York and an L.A. music studio used by Green Day. More will be available in the Horizon Hyperscape beta app over time, he added. The potential for photo shoots or runway scenes that are never broken down, but virtually memorialized jumps to mind. Brands could also give customers access to behind-the-scenes spaces, as a way to forge a personal connection. Rise of the Visual Döppelbots Another fascinating tidbit is a new Meta AI power, specifically AI Studio. The set of tools gives creators a new capability to create AIs that can interact with their communities on social media. In a demo, creator and author Don Allen Stevenson III showed an AI version of himself that he trained to respond to frequently asked questions, just as he himself would respond to fans. This is essentially a visual bot — perhaps a döppelbot — that looked and spoke like him. Meant to be helpful, this one can get creepy. But if curated and trained well, it might be a novel way for a renowned designer to offer some face time with fans, clients and others without the time drain. For users, real-time styling advice will now be possible using the Ray-Ban smartglasses, thanks to multimodal video AI. “Meta AI is now going to be able to give you real-time help as you are doing things, like trying to figure out what outfit you want to wear to a party that you’re going to,” said Zuckerberg. For example, if a person sifts through various clothes to weigh options, the camera on the smart Ray-Bans can see them too, recommending that dress on the right or remembering something it saw earlier. Meta AI can even give that advice in some familiar voices, including John Cena, Judi Dench, Kristen Bell, Keegan Michael Key or Awkwafina. Learn a Second Language — Fast Another new Threads feature uses AI to power real-time language translation dubbing with automatic lip syncing. So forget captions or dubbed voiceovers. A video by a Spanish speaker could be viewed in English, or vice versa, as if the spokesperson, model or other personality is actually speaking the other language. International or multiregion brands, take note. Meta’s Puma Collab Brings Mixed-reality Shopping Unlike the others, Meta’s Puma collaboration wasn’t part of the keynote. But it should have been. During the conference, Meta’s Web Platform Team teased “the future of e-commerce” through a new web-based extended reality shopping scenario. Extended reality, or XR, is a blanket term covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR). The Puma shopping experience works as a virtual overlay of product on the headset’s camera pass-through view. But it’s not a lean-back proposition. Shoppers can swipe to change the item’s color, and “experience how each colorway transforms the environment around them,” according to a representative. Every design will come with a unique atmosphere. The experience will officially roll out for Quest users this fall. However, it looks like a better fit for Orion. There’s a sense of separation in seeing the world through the headset’s live camera feed, whereas eyeglasses offer a direct view of reality. In other words, there’s nothing to stand between the consumer and the product. “A lot of the stuff we’ve been talking about for a long time … glasses, mixed reality, AI — it’s happening,” Zuckerberg said at Meta Connect. “And you know, we can start to see how the future of computing and the future of human connection are going to look and it’s pretty awesome.” Analysts apparently need more convincing, at least when it comes to Orion. Martin Yang, of Oppenheimer, told clients in a note that Orion is no Apple Vision Pro killer, citing cost. There’s no ship date or retail price announced yet — again, because it’s a prototype — but it will likely top the rival device’s $3,500. Some estimates say Orion costs $10,000 or more to build. Yang still called it “impressive,” given that “most other AR glasses on the market, despite heavier designs, have much narrower FOVs [fields of view] of 40-50 degrees,” he said. Post, of Bank of America, believes Orion is “several years (and tens of billions) away from general release.” In the meantime, Meta is giving creators and brands plenty of other tools to play with.

Title: The Memo: To AI or no?

Hello, Memo readers! AI is gaining some fans in a place where many also fear it: the office. People who use AI in the office seem to have a “healthier” relationship with their work, compared to those who don’t use AI at all, according to a survey of 15,600 workers commissioned by HP (who’s hardware and software is increasingly being infused with AI). “Knowledge workers who use AI are +11-points happier with their relationship with work than their colleagues who don’t,” HP said in its latest Work Relationship Index report. The study also found that 90% of surveyed AI users say the tools have helped them save more time, 85% say the tools helped them dedicate more time to important and timely tasks, 84% reported that AI helped them be more creative, while 83% said such services helped them to find pleasure in their work. But while some employees use AI tools to improve their work lives, many are concerned about the downsides of the rise of workplace AI, including its role in layoffs. “It’s a good warning that with more automation and decision support tools, less human interactions will be necessary,” said Christoph Wollersheim, consultant at leadership advisory firm Egon Zehnder. “There are great benefits that will come with the automation, but also risks that personal relationships will suffer or will get replaced by AI,” he told Quartz. Read the full article here. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is creating technology likely to upend humans’ relationship with the written word. But when Altman needs to keep his thoughts organized, he still relies on pen and paper. “There’s all these like fancy notebooks in the world. You don’t want those. You definitely want a spiral notebook because one thing that’s important is you can rip pages out frequently, and you also want it to lie, like, flat and open on the table,” Altman said on the “How I Write” podcast hosted by David Perell.

Full Content:
Not only does Costco Wholesale (COST) do a good job of getting its 76 million members in the door—but, according to a new report, manages to keep them there, too. The average Costco visit lasted 37.3 minutes for U.S. customers in the first half of 2024, according to a Monday report from Emarketer citing data from Placer.ai. That’s more than Walmart (WMT) (31.8 minutes) and Target (TGT) (28.7 minutes), according to the report. Costco is also the only one of the three to see its average "dwell time" for customers staying in-store increase from the first half of 2021 to the same period this year. One likely reason for the extended stays is that Costco frequently changes its layout, creating a "treasure hunt" experience for customers. The membership-based retailer isn’t alone in changing things up, but it is notorious for rotating its stock of items. In general, grocery stores are often known to stock essentials, like bread, milk, and eggs near the back of the store so customers have to walk all the way through to find them. Costco had 76 million members at the end of its most recent quarter, but starting Sept. 1 those members are paying more. After the retailer raised its membership price for the first time in seven years, executives said on an earnings call last week that they haven't seen any meaningful changes to renewal trends in the first month.

Full Content:
In a challenging market environment, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. (NYSE:DV) stock has recorded a new 52-week low, touching down at $16.8. This latest price level reflects a significant downturn from previous periods, marking a stark contrast to the company's performance over the past year. The digital media measurement and analytics firm has seen its stock value decrease by 39.71% over the last year, underscoring the broader market volatility and sector-specific headwinds that have impacted investor sentiment towards DoubleVerify. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for investors monitoring the company's trajectory in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In other recent news, DoubleVerify, a leading software platform for digital media measurement and analytics, reported a 17% increase in Q2 revenue to $156 million, spurred by strong performance in social and Connected TV measurement and a growing supply side platform business. The company also reported an 83% gross margin and $47 million in adjusted EBITDA. Notably, Needham, Truist Securities, and Canaccord Genuity revised their stock price targets for DoubleVerify, while maintaining a Buy rating. In addition to financial outcomes, DoubleVerify introduced its Inflammatory Politics and News category on Meta (NASDAQ:META), a tool designed to protect advertisers from aligning with controversial content. This initiative is supported by DoubleVerify's Universal Content Intelligence, an AI-powered engine that ensures precise content categorization across the platform. DoubleVerify has also established new partnerships and anticipates a positive revenue impact starting early 2025 following the closure of competing services like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s Moat and Grapeshot. The company's growth strategies were highlighted during investor meetings, including expansion into social media properties, adoption of new pre-bid optimization products, and scaling in international markets. These are the recent developments for DoubleVerify. DoubleVerify's recent 52-week low of $16.8 aligns with InvestingPro data showing the stock has taken a significant hit over the last six months, with a price total return of -51.19%. Despite this downturn, the company maintains some financial strengths. According to InvestingPro Tips, DoubleVerify holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial foundation amidst market challenges. Additionally, the company boasts impressive gross profit margins, which stand at 82.18% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. While the stock is trading near its 52-week low, it's worth noting that DoubleVerify's P/E ratio is 47.09, suggesting it's still trading at a high earnings multiple relative to its current market position. This valuation metric, combined with the company's strong gross margins and cash position, presents a complex picture for investors to consider. For those seeking a deeper understanding of DoubleVerify's financial health and market position, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips, providing a more comprehensive analysis to inform investment decisions in these volatile times.

Title: Netflix Cancellations Nearly Tripled After Chairman Reed Hastings Endorsed Kamala Harris

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Netflix chairman Reed Hastings believes Kamala Harris will be good for America — even if his support for her may not be good for Netflix. Days after Hastings, the co-founder of Netflix and former co-CEO, endorsed Harris for president, Netflix had its most cancellations in a year, according to Antenna data. From July 25 through July 29, Netflix’s average daily cancels increased by 2.7x compared to the prior two weeks, the streaming-measurement company found. July 26 was Netflix’s biggest day for churn in the past year. After July 29, Netflix’s churn levels returned back to normal and have not elevated since. All told, July’s churn of 2.8 percent was elevated versus both June (1.8 percent) and August (2.0 percent). Related Stories The 17 Best Thrillers Streaming on Netflix in October, from ‘Fair Play’ to ‘Emily the Criminal’ ‘The Platform 2’ Review: Netflix’s Stomach-Churning Sequel Is Full of Good Ideas but Starving for a Better Story Bloomberg first reported the news of the temporary churn uptick. Hastings’ support came via a post on X a bit after midnight on July 23. All Hastings tweeted was “Congrats to Kamala Harris — now it is time to win.” It didn’t take more than that for the cancellations to come pouring in. Congrats to Kamala Harris — now it is time to win Hastings did do more than tweet though. He later donated $7 million to a super PAC supporting Harris’ run for president, the Republican Accountability PAC. Hastings said it is the most he’s ever donated to a single candidate. A spokesperson for Netflix did not immediately respond to IndieWire’s request for comment on the Antenna findings. We suspect Netflix will be OK. As of June 30, 2024, Netflix had 277.65 million global paid subscribers. These days, the streamer is making nearly $10 billion in revenue each quarter — with more than $2 billion in profit — and its stock price is over $700 per share. Netflix (NFLX on the NASDAQ) shares had fallen below $200 in 2022 after the company shocked the streaming world with back-to-back quarterly losses. Coincidentally, September 30 is the final day of the third quarter of 2024, which we colloquially refer to as the summer quarter. Netflix will announce the results from July-September on Thursday, October 17, 2024 at 4 p.m. ET/1 p.m. PT. Antenna plans to share its own September data on October 20, a spokesperson told IndieWire, give or take a few days. Hastings, who stepped down in January, will watch from afar as co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Sarandos’ own co-CEO Greg Peters, the company’s CFO Spence Neumann, and its VP of Finance, IR & Corporate Development Spencer Wang present the Q3 results to shareholders and the greater stock market. Netflix is far and away the most impactful streamer in the marketplace; Amazon’s Prime Video and the Disney Bundle are its only real competitors. Election Day is November 5.

Title: Nuclear Power Won’t Solve A.I.’s Energy Problem, Says Hedge Fund Mogul David Tepper
URL: https://observer.com/2024/09/hedge-fund-billionaire-david-tepper-ai-nuclear-energy/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T18:05:19Z
Full Content:
With Big Tech locked in an arms race to become the next dominant A.I. player, companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are heralding nuclear power as a solution to the technology’s energy problem. But the hedge fund billionaire David Tepper, founder and president of Appaloosa Management, believes nuclear power simply won’t be enough for A.I.’s development needs. “Some of these projections are crazy,” he told CNBC on Sept. 26. “If you’re going to meet the power needs of what they need for A.I., you’re going to have to use natural gas,” he said.

You can opt out anytime. As the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta spend billions of dollars on building data centers to power A.I. models, they have also sought out ways to offset these data centers’ massive energy consumption. Data centers are expected to double their energy use by the end of the decade and take up 9 percent of the power supply in the U.S., according to the Electric Power Institute. Nuclear power, including the revival of dormant nuclear plants, has emerged as a way to pursue these ambitions without increasing carbon emissions. Microsoft earlier this month signed a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy, the owner of Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant and the site of a 1979 partial reactor meltdown, in a deal that will reopen one of the site’s two units. And in March, Amazon Web Services struck a $650 million deal with the energy company Talen Energy to acquire a nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania. Despite the tech world’s optimism about nuclear as a carbon-free alternative, Tepper, who is “exploring different parts of the energy side of the tech market,” said there are too many hurdles to cross when it comes to reviving nuclear power. Governors around the country “aren’t going to let their nuclear power come offline—it’s not going to happen, it’s a joke,” Tepper told CNBC. “It will never get by these individual [public utility commissions].” Tepper currently has an estimated net worth of $21.3 billion. His hedge fund is one of the most successful in recent history, having gained a total of $35 billion since its inception in 1993 and $2.7 billion in 2023 alone. Tepper is also the owner of the NFL’s Carolina Panthers team, which he acquired for around $2.2 billion in 2018. Energy consumption isn’t the only aspect of A.I. that Tepper is unsure about. In June, Tepper unloaded more than 80 percent of his stake in Nvidia (NVDA), the chip maker leading the A.I. boom. The move, which reduced his Nvidia holding to around $85 million, was caused by Tepper’s belief that the stock “was too high at the time and would come down.” “Unfortunately, we didn’t buy it when it came back down,” he said. While the billionaire said Nvidia is looking great for 2024 and 2025, he’s less confident about the company’s prospects—and the sustainability of current A.I. hype—in 2026 and 2027. “I just don’t know how you know,” he said. “It’s not my preferred vehicle versus other things that I have more confidence in.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: TikTok's owner is reportedly developing an AI model with Huawei's chips
URL: https://qz.com/tiktok-owner-bytedance-develop-ai-model-huawei-chips-1851660657
Time Published: 2024-09-30T15:39:00Z
Full Content:
As the U.S. escalates export controls on China, TikTok’s owner is reportedly planning to use a homegrown chipmaker for an artificial intelligence model it’s developing. ByteDance is planning to build an AI model using chips from Huawei, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter. The company wants to use Huawei’s Ascend 910B chips to train the model, the people said. ByteDance has reportedly ordered over 100,000 of Huawei’s chips, but, as of July, has received less than 30,000 of them. One person told Reuters the model under development is expected to be less powerful than ByteDance’s Doubao model, which was released last August. “The entire premise here is wrong,” a spokesperson for ByteDance said in a statement shared with Quartz. “No new AI model is being developed.” Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s Ascend 910B chip is used for less intense AI model inferencing, people told Reuters, but training requires more compute power, and therefore, more advanced chips. And Huawei was reportedly having a hard time increasing production of the Ascend 910B — China’s best alternative to Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips that cannot be sold to Chinese customers under U.S. trade restrictions. The chip fabrication machines Huawei uses to produce the advanced chips are designed for older generations of chips, The Information reported, and repurposing them was causing certain components to break down. Since the U.S. began implementing trade restrictions on advanced chips, including those designed by Nvidia, in 2022, ByteDance has sought chips from Chinese companies, and worked on developing its own. ByteDance has designed two chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that it plans to mass produce by 2026, The Information reported. The Chinese government, meanwhile, is encouraging tech companies to buy AI chips from local companies, and become less dependent on Nvidia, Bloomberg reported. Nvidia has developed three AI chips for the Chinese market in compliance with export controls, including the H20, which ByteDance has ordered hundreds of thousands of.

As the U.S. escalates export controls on China, TikTok’s owner is reportedly planning to use a homegrown chipmaker for an artificial intelligence model it’s developing. ByteDance is planning to build an AI model using chips from Huawei, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter. The company wants to use Huawei’s Ascend 910B chips to train the model, the people said. ByteDance has reportedly ordered over 100,000 of Huawei’s chips, but, as of July, has received less than 30,000 of them. One person told Reuters the model under development is expected to be less powerful than ByteDance’s Doubao model, which was released last August. “The entire premise here is wrong,” a spokesperson for ByteDance said in a statement shared with Quartz. “No new AI model is being developed.” Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: New weight loss drugs could be developed much faster if Roche gets its way

Roche told investors on Monday that it plans to make significant cuts to both the cost and time it takes for it to develop new drugs, including its slate of experimental weight loss and diabetes medications. At an investor event, the Swiss pharma giant announced its goal to reduce the average development costs of launched drugs by 20% and shorten the timeline from early drug discovery to the completion of phase 3 trials by 40% by 2030, according to a presentation posted on the company’s website. These targets include the company’s recently acquired weight loss treatments. Roche is one of several pharma companies racing to break up the anti-obesity drug duopoly held by Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), which produces Zepbound and Mounjaro. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs, known as GLP-1/GIP treatments, will reach $105 billion by 2030. The medications work by mimicking hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. They were originally used to treat type-2 diabetes, but have become highly sought after for their slimming side effects. The 127-year-old Roche first entered the weight loss drug game earlier this year when it bought Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. The deal included three candidates, CT-996 — a daily pill — and the weekly injectables CT-388 and CT-868. Roche said on Monday that together the three drugs have the potential to reach more than 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.6 billion) in annual sales. In May the company said that patients taking CT-388 lost 18.8% of their weight on average after 24 weeks on the drug in a small clinical trial. As a result, the company said in July that it is fast-tracking the development of its weight loss drug candidates. Its stock has risen over 37% since May.

Title: Super Micro Computer's big stock split is today. Here’s what to know
URL: https://qz.com/super-micro-computer-stock-split-1851660648
Time Published: 2024-09-30T14:35:00Z
Full Content:
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is set to undergo a stock split after the market closes on Monday, aligning itself with other prominent AI-driven companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which also executed stock splits earlier this year. Following the split, the stock will begin trading Tuesday at its adjusted—and substantially lower—price. Shortly after the market opened on Monday morning, Super Micro Computer’s shares were priced at $426, reflecting a 1.5% increase. Super Micro Computer’s 10-for-1 stock split is expected to boost demand for the company’s shares. In a stock split, the company increases the number of shares, reducing the share price, but the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same and doesn’t affect the company’s valuation. Super Micro Computer’s 10-for-1 split means that, for each SMCI share an investor owns, they will receive an extra nine after the split is completed. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including potential sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following these accusations, Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course.

The Non-Consumer Advocate by Katy on September 30, 2024 · 61 comments { 57 comments… read them below or add one } The last time we ordered Covid tests they never arrived. However, our insurance company allows us to get 8 tests per month from Walgreens or CVS. Hubby got his last week; as there are only two of us in the house I will wait and pick mine up down the line. Reply 90% of the time when I meet up with friends, we go for a walk in our neighborhood, or a hike at the adjoining nature preserve. A free workout + bonus friend time? Sign me up. I did three of those last week, and my steps are also looking great. 😉 1) Used up absolutely ancient carrots in a crockpot chicken & dumplings recipe (one of my faves). I rinsed the carrots, and they smelled fine, so in they went. I’m the only soup eater in my house, so I made enough for a couple of meals, & froze the rest in single serving containers for easy lunches. 2) Sold some stuff on eBay & relisted a bike on FB Marketplace. I find bikes bring out the biggest negotiators, and I really dislike that part of selling, so I’m giving myself a huge pat on the back for getting this listed & dealing with all of the crazy shenanigans. 3) I really wanted a turkey sandwich on sourdough with sharp cheddar. Thought of stopping by a deli when I was out running errands. Instead, I bought everything I needed to make my own at the store. It was about the same for the ingredients as the sandwich, but so far, I’ve made three sandwiches & another grilled cheese for DS17. Cheaper would have been finding something to eat at home, but this was a good compromise. 4) We allow our home to be a study destination for DS17 & his friends, while they are all studying for their AP classes. They love the library, but it closes early some days. By studying at our house, they avoid having to buy something at a coffee shop or restaurant. 5) Continue to eat from our garden: tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, herbs. And, the pomegranates are almost ripe! Reply Not sure if this was frugal–last Monday we drove to southern Maryland to a produce auction. It was organized twenty-some years ago when the Old Order Mennonites decided to stop growing tobacco and switch to produce. Farmers drove their horse-drawn carts through a gap in the auction house. One paid by the item but had to buy the whole lot. Last year I got 32 long-necked pumpkins someplace else. We had eaten them all by mid-April. So I bid on a lot of 42 winter squash–and won. We schlepped them all home, and I weighed them as Bill brought them into the basement. They average 15 pounds compared to last year’s five and the lot included 46 rather than 42 squash. I have 682 pounds of delicious winter squash. It was time to call women I know who feed large families, hungry neighbors, or the homeless. I rehomed 15 of them yesterday and invited women to come back when they need more. I paid only 30 cents per pound at a time when winter squash run $2-3 per pound in stores. Other than that same old, same old–drinking water, cooking at home, reading library books, and meeting my fabric needs by helping sort donations for my guild’s yard sale. Reply Mary in MD, that’s a wonderful story about the squash! You’ve spread a circle of blessings far and wide. Reply Where is the auction? My daughter lives in Maryland. Is it a regular thing or just a one and done? Reply It’s the Loveville produce auction, slightly southeast of Leonardtown. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday through December. They have a website she can check out. Big lots and there is a small lot auction as well. I would have picked up cabbage, but the Prius was packed. Reply Thanks Reply Wow, I always wanted to go to one of those auctions, what a steal on the squash! Are they all the same or different? I have at least 200 squash (squashs?) from my garden this year – couldn’t believe how many grew, some are kind of weird (what IS that plant) but pretty, so may become decorations. Got 5 big cinderella type pumpkins and three lovely big white knobbly pumpkins, as well as a multitude of acorn, red kuri, baby pumpkin and medium pumpkin, delicata, plus a selection of dark green and light grey and blotchy and … names to be determined when I re-read the packages… I am now like the zucchini growers, looking for open car windows, LOL. How do you like to cook your squash? Recipes appreciated! * as for sharing your bounty with families you know, that is what the deal-finders do – let their friends know! Reply I think I have Boer, Musque de Provence, and New York cheese squash. I typed out my killer recipe for them last fall in these comments. Robin Robertson’s VEGAN ON THE CHEAP’s peanutty pumpkin stew. I bake them at 350 in halves if I can get them open, whole if I can’t. The ones with tan skin I chop in big chunks and bring to high in my pressure cooker, then turn off the burner. I use my immersion blender to puree them still in the cooker. Eating the skin isn’t a problem, but some people find green flecks off-putting. Reply 1. Used a package of gluten-free pizza dough mix to make two big batches of Italian herb flat bread. It came out quite nice. I cut it into single servings and froze it for my husband’s future meals. 2. My son accidentally bought a package of chicken sandwich meat he was never going to eat, so I chopped it up and used it with some last bits of frozen veggies, homegrown cherry tomatoes and rice to make a very tasty little casserole. 3. Rearranged our pantry to get some bulk purchased food from the clearance store off the floor. 4. Decluttered the pan shelf in the kitchen and found some items to donate, as I just do not bake desserts much any more. 5. The wind that came through from the hurricane tore loose a section of our bamboo fence, which I repaired with some bungee cords and filled in a spot where a bamboo cane shattered with straight sticks cut from some shrubbery. The giant catalpa leaves blown all over the yard got picked up and laid over some muddy areas to keep down the mud my dogs track into the house. Reply Glad you’re okay after the hurricane and only the fence needed bungee cords to hold it together. Don’t know what we’d do without bungee cords and duct tape! Reply Bungee cords are one of the most useful things. Right now one is holding my folded up clothes drying rack up off the floor so the puppy can’t chew on it and another is a divider in the metal mesh document holder on the side of the fridge. The uses are near endless! We need to replace the bamboo fence, but everything is so freaking expensive. Thst’s going to be a project to save up for. Reply Used up the last of the hello fresh discounted meals. Now making comprehensive shopping list We each get our $40 quarterly HABA allowance from United Healthcare so making a separate list for Walmart Sold 2 items via FB both happened to be dog show friends. Delivered 1 to a local dog show I happened to be going to. The other I’ll deliver at a show in the future Reply I really prefer going for a walk with a friend or just sitting on the front porch with a glass of wine rather than dinner out. My daughters, mother and sister have a girls night out once a week. I’ve said I wouldn’t mind if girls night became a bottle of wine with takeout and then help each other fix something or do a project around the house. Anyway here’s my FFT. 1. After many, many years of shopping for a new kitchen table and chairs I finally bought a set off of marketplace. It looks like it belongs in my kitchen and although it’s 25 years old it looks almost new. The only thing is I also had to take the china cabinet too. I don’t need another one and although it’s beautiful I’m not sure whether I’ll keep it. Right now I have the bottom half placed in my great room. I might sell it on marketplace or keep it in my basement for my next house. 2. I picked up a few ball jars on a free table while I was out of town. My daughter slammed on the brakes when she saw the free sign. That’s my kid. My other daughter took home a very cool vintage lamp. We are all very enthusiastic about free piles. 3. I finished a library book on my Kindle and started another. I’m most of the way through The Stone Girl by Dirk Wittenborn. It’s kind of dark but I can’t put it down. 4. My daughter is returning to her previous work schedule M-F which means I’ll be dog sitting for her a few days a week. Her husband stayed with my dog while we were out of town. I’ll also keep their dog while they are on their honeymoon. My oldest daughter and her husband will be gone for three weeks and my mom will keep their dog for them. It sounds crazy but it all works out. 5. I’m eating leftovers from an event I hosted at my house. All leftovers were divided and shared with whoever wanted them. I had several out of town guests that stayed with me which was a significant savings. Reply I’m also included in girls night…insert eye roll. Reply Some of my best time with my friends and family are when we go for walks in the neighborhood or do yard work. Maybe that makes me boring, but I’m ok with it. 1. Due to Hurricane Helene, which missed my area of Florida I was afforded a paid day off of work and some much needed down time. My son scored two days off school which he was able to make up some work. 2. I forced myself to look at sales adds and use Ibotta and some other apps when organizing my grocery list. The savings didn’t feel large, but I believe they add up. I can now cash out $23 in ibotta money. 3. I scanned my receipts into Fetch and Shopkick to also work toward giftcards in the future. I have stopped using Receipt Hog, a similar app, I scan but it doesn’t register the receipts. I tried! 4. I am considering going back to doing a sidegig delivery service. I signed up for Ubereats and realized I had to update my phone. I deleted over 2 gigs of data and updated only to find out that my model iphone will never udpate into ios 16 or higher which leaves me out of the Ubereats app…..back to the drawing board on weird sidegigs I can do to make more money. 5. I cooked from home for the last four days with us going for icecream twice. It felt nice to cook at home…..and a bit time consuming. But yay for eating what we already have at home and packing lunches. Reply 1. I too ordered free Covid tests and shared the news with my daughter and my sister. 2. The New York Times offered to upgrade my digital subscription to full access for the price I was paying ($1/week) for one year. Since this extended the time period I would pay that amount by several months I said yes. I noted the cancel date on my calendar. It is nice to have access to recipes and other things. 3. The grocery store had an offer to save $10 on groceries when you spend $50 on a certain gift card. I decided that was the cheapest way to obtain nutmeg. The nutmeg rang up for more than the shelf price so I received it for free. 4. I made a big pot of chili and used canned tomatoes that most needed to be used and low sodium beans I’d bought on clearance. 5. While we were in the Midwest we ate lunch at Culver’s and took the survey to receive free frozen custard. Reply Oh Culver’s! My fast-food weakness! Lucky I live in New England where there aren’t any or I would be there more than is healthy for me or my wallet. When we travel to an area that has Culver’s, we always make sure to pop in for something delicious. Reply Culver’s is quite prevalent in my area. Their food is well worth the price. I like it that they and another locally founded “fast” food restaurant will raise prices rather than skimp on quality. Reply I was gifted a prayer plant in 2003 and it’s still living, having been re-potted a few times. Interesting when the new leaves start to open. You can actually hear them if things are very quiet – scared me the first time it happened. LOL! Reply This is not frugal, but it makes my husband happy and that makes me happy: we bought an upright freezer with drawers that you pull out. So, now we have a drawer for meat, one for chicken and fish, another for…well, you get the point. His back has been hurting him and he would get so frustrated and in more pain trying to rummage around our chest freezer, so I would not ask him to get anything out of the chest freezer and things would get freezer burned. He is thrilled and, thus, so am I. It is our Christmas gift to each other because, really, we could have stumbled along the way we were. It is so wonderful to have things organized and easy to access. To compensate for this not frugal thing, I: 1. made myself list 10 items on eBay. Four have already sold! Turns out antique jewelry is a hot item. This alone paid for 75% of the freezer cost. 2. Took several bags of things to Good Will. Made sure to get a tax receipt. 3. Did 2 more post office mystery shops that were a longer drive from the house but were being paid with a bonus more than large enough. Another 3% of the freezer paid for. 4. Sent off a birthday gift with one of the post office shops, and a sold item with the other one. This saved me about $20, so more of the freezer paid off. 5. Took the chance and waited for an oil change mystery shop to have a bonus attached because no one wanted it. $160 paid for the oil change we get at the start of every winter, plus some cash. More of the freezer paid off. Only about $40 left to go and the freezer will not have taken anything out of our savings to pay for it. Reply Lindsey, the freezer sounds like an excellent use of your money. May you and your DH have less back pain and less freezer waste as a result. Reply The arthritis in my back was why I bought a small upright freezer to replace our little, very old chest freezer. The new freezer has fixed shelves, but I measured carefully and found baskets to fit at Dollar Tree that pull out so easily. Reply Your new freezer sounds wonderful and I’m sure your DH’s back will thank you both. I never saw one with pull-out drawers…how very convenient! Reply Lindsey, this made my heart sing. I love reading about the love you and your husband have for each other, the organized freezer you now have, and all of the ways you found to pay for it. Reply I’m so glad you got a new freezer that works for you and I like how you’re paying for it. That is awesome. Reply 1. Had some expired (with no extended dates) COVID test kits, so I opened them and recycled as many papers and boxes that I could before tossing the rest. Ugh, I hate waste. 2. Thanks to Heidi Louise’s tip, I ordered free COVID tests from our government. 3. Fed the exterior painting team chocolate cookies I received from a friend and Gatorade that I had received as part of a random take-all Buy Nothing post. I was planning to serve the painters lemonade and chocolate chip cookies, so the timing of the gifts worked out great. Now I can give those cookies and the lemonade to the landscape crew that will be here for three days. Among other things, they will be placing the 70+ boulders that came with our property within the new landscape and for rock walls needed for better drainage. The previous homeowner had the boulders in a pile in the backyard for years and never got around to using them. 4. Saved $1,200 in landscaping costs by moving rocks and plants ourselves and giving away other items on Buy Nothing. Not to mention free workouts! Also brought a carload of rocks to a dear neighbor and used the smaller-size rocks as fill where our driveway has washed out. Used part of the $1,200 savings to buy another tree and expand a planting area. 5. Attended an economist’s presentation at our financial advisor’s office and received a free lunch. Which is ironic since it was economist Milton Friedman who said, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Brought in papers for shredding as the office provides that service for free. Reply @MB in MN – technically your lunch was not free. Time is our most precious resource and you spent time. My micro econ teacher had a true/false test question “If lawyers didn’t charge fees, their services would be free”. False – you’d have to spend time due to the demand of the lawyer’s services. But I do consider free shredding a good deal. Disappointed my go-to local bank has no shred day planned for the rest of this year. A local non-profit offered shred services but I think that went by the wayside during Covid. I should call and ask. I don’t mind paying. Reply FFT, Freebies Galore Edition: (1) On my usual early a.m. stroll through the ‘hood, I came across several interesting finds. The first = two grocery bags full of books in the recycling containers of a nearby apartment complex. The bags were so full that I wasn’t able to get them out of the containers, let alone carry them home on foot. But I reached my “picking stick” into one bag and fished out one book–which turned out to be a nice paperback translation into English of Virgil’s epic The Aeneid?!? (As Mrs. Rachel Lynde says in one of the Anne of Green Gables books, “You’re never safe from being surprised till you’re dead.”) So I’m planning a predawn return tomorrow to this site with the Honda Element and will persuade the bags out of the containers by whatever means. (2) This one’s for you, texasilver: My next surprise came at the local Dollar General’s dumpster–which is usually kept locked, but which was unlocked and open this morning, with a heaping helping of clean, undamaged, and within-date foodstuffs (mostly cereals and crackers) on top. Fortunately, I had a clean backup bag with me, so I loaded it with a family-size box of Kellogg’s Raisin Bran, a box of Ritz crackers, and two boxes of Nature Valley “blueberry muffins” bars (new to me, and I look forward to trying them). And I’m going to take the Element around there tomorrow too, in the hope of scoring more stuff–although this may be chancier. (3) On the set of Depression-era brick steps connecting the main drag below us (where the Dollar General is) with our cul-de-sac at the top of the hill, I found not only more NY State deposit bottles and cans–which were what I was really looking for in my (1) and (2)–but a good solid steel made-in-USA pry bar. I scooped that up immediately, both on general principles and in case whoever left it on the steps was planning to use it for petty crime. (4) One of my later morning errands today was a stop at the pop-up thrift shop run out of a disused bowling alley on Monday mornings only by a local Catholic church, in aid of its food pantry. In addition to my purchases (two Chico’s tops, a pair each of Lane Bryant and Martha Stewart brand jeans, and four skeins of yarn for my next-door neighbor’s close friend, for a grand total of $10), I took a just-past-sell-by date package of Thomas’s English muffins from the free bin. (5) And I’m about to head over to the link provided by Katy for the free COVID tests. Thanks, Katy, and let’s all be prepared! Reply A. Marie, I just want to say that you seem like a very good and caring person and I always enjoy your comments here and on The Frugal Girl. Reply Seconded! I find myself wishing I could read A. Marie’s blog. Reply Holy Smokes!! I cannot believe the Dollar store bounty. We do not have one of those in Fairbanks, and I have never been to one when we go Outside, so when people talk about the great deals there I am envious. But to get them for free from their dumpster!! I do have a dumpster story. I once picked up my mail from the post office (there was no delivery to the cabin I was living in, back in the hills) and as I was leaving, I stopped at the open dumpster in the back of the post office to throw away junk mail. Just as I flung some in, I realized I had also thrown in a check for an article I had written. The dumpster was nearly empty so I could not possibly reach the check…I decided to climb in to retrieve it. As it turned out, I was a lot more athletic in my dreams than I was in reality. I could not get out. I finally had to shout for help and eventually this guy peered in and asked me if I was okay. I did not answer with sarcasm, as he was my knight in shining armor. He stood there a minute and said (and I will never forget this), “Miss, getting you out of there is going to be a two man job. I’ll be back.” I was in my 20s and as thin as I ever was going to be…He was good to his word, returning with a real bruiser of a guy who had been drinking. The post office was three doors from a bar, so he probably went in there and grabbed the nearest big man. They tried, heroically, to yank me out by my arms, to no avail. Finally the bigger one said, “I think I can push her ass up and if you can finish pulling her out.” It was very humiliating to have this guy help me put a foot up on the inside brace of the dumpster, and then he put his back against my rear and with a lot of groaning hoisted me up enough that the other guy and I, working together, could pull me out. I was filthy and there was a moment when we thought the inebriated fellow was going to have to be rescued, but eventually it was all over and I went home to wash my clothes. So, when I hear of you and others going into a dumpster, I know that not even bars of gold could tempt me back into one of those things. Reply Lindsey, just to clarify: I have climbed into a few dumpsters back in the days when I was young and agile, but not this time. I simply reached in with my picking stick and retrieved enough items to fill my clean bag that way. I no longer take witless chances. But that’s quite a ripping yarn about you and the check and the two rescuers (one sober and one not so much). Count me in among the many fans who think you should write an autobiography, in addition to the Adventures of Houndini and Clobber Paws. Reply Frugality inspires resourcefulness! Whatever method you need to employ to retrieve your foodstuffs is a good one. Reply What a great story! Reply I’ve done a lot of trash picking but never actually crawled into a dumpster. I was shocked a couple years ago when we were staying at the shore in a house with a bathtub. I decided a long soak with exfoliation would be a great vacation activity. When it was time to get out, I couldn’t. By the time the Mister got back, the water and I were both very cold. Reply That story made me laugh so hard!! I could see it in detail in my mind!! You really should write a blog or book Reply You made me smile A. Marie! You never know what treasure a Dol Gen dumpster will contain. Reply A. Marie, those giant size boxes of Raisin Bran sell for $6.99/box in my area (SW Ohio), so I’d say you got a great deal with the other things you snagged! Reply Thanks Katy and Heidi Louise for the tip about the Covid tests. Like A. Marie, I’m headed over to the site after I finish my FFTs to order some. 1. While out walking with DH, I saw something in a familiar shape in the dirt by the side of the road. Turned out to be a quarter, dirty and almost unrecognizable, but I brought it home, cleaned it up and into the found change jar it went. 2. I found a deposit can on another walk with DH. Only worth 5 cents in my state but I wouldn’t walk by a nickel laying on the ground, so I grabbed it. 3. Like Jill A and others here, I much prefer hosting guests at my house or going to others’ houses for get togethers. It’s not only for the savings but because we can sit around and eat, drink and talk until the cows come home and nobody cares. In a restaurant, there’s always the old side eye from the waitress or hostess who want to keep things moving. I understand in that business time is money which is why I prefer socializing in other ways. Walking is a great way to socialize and get steps in, I find. 4. Speaking of…we had a couple we’ve been friends with for years come over on Friday night for the above-mentioned way of entertaining. DH wanted pizza so we bit the bullet, ordered two and sat on the deck gabbing and talking for five hours! They brought beer and we had seltzer (store brand) on hand. Great time. 5. Reading a library book: The Witches Daughter by Orenda Fink. Great book if you like memoirs. Reply 1. I did another mystery shop with a *relatively* good payout of $22 to eat a hot dog and some fries, and it was in the neighborhood of several errands. 2. Almost stuck to my list at the grocery store, but I did purchase a $2.50 container of dolmas (for 10). I’ll have a couple for my lunch “on the road” and it will keep me from stopping somewhere. Like Katy, I also did used Fetch to get all of my 25 points, as I rarely get anything more due to lack of name brand purchases. 3. I stopped into the more expensive Stop & Shop to pick up 3 items from FlashFoods, which I notice now charge a 5% processing fee (lame). While there, I bought 1 loss leader and picked up a free jar of Chosen Mayo (who would pay $8.67 for a jar is beyond me, but I’ll happily pay $0.00). 4. I signed up for my free Covid and Flu shop. I hate getting shots (or anything with a needle) but this will means 20 points toward the 200 points that I have to “earn” to get 10% off my annual cost of health insurance. 5. I did a survey for Nielson’s of my media usage. It took less than 5 minutes and I got a $10 gift certificate of my choosing. Reply Loved your 5 FFTs. It’s the small and medium savings that can really add up. And I agree…$8.67 for a jar of mayo sounds like highway robbery. Reply While I consider mayo on the bottom of the food pyramid, I really can’t believe $8.67 a jar is far superior to anything else on the market. We did try Duke’s, not bad but I would not put it above anything other mayo I’ve consumed. Reply It is highway robbery. But I have an allergy to soy, so I’m stuck spending that on the prepared stuff. It’s not worth it for me to make it up fresh, because I wouldn’t trust the raw egg sitting in the fridge. But it makes me careful with using it. Reply 1. I made a hashbrown casserole, using up some eggs and cream that needed to be used. Now I have several breakfasts ready in the freezer for when I need something quick. 2. I cancelled my Walmart+ subscription. I had tried it for a month, and I did use it enough in September to make the cost worthwhile, but I don’t want to keep paying for it long term. 3. I bought only items that were on sale at Kroger. I was pretty pleased with some of the deals I got, especially a $0.39 chocolate bar from a fancy brand that normally would be out of my price range. 4. Same old, same old otherwise. Reply 1. I also ordered the free Covid tests and they are en route to us now. Our library also had free tests, so I was able to get one more box there. 2. Had a free trial week of Paramount and when I clicked cancel on the last day, they offered me a free month. I watched Mayor of Kingstown and Yellowjackets, but there’s not a lot I’m tempted by. 3. Attended the fall rummage sale at a local church. I think it’s one of the few places left that still has items priced at a nickel and a dime. I found a few things for myself, and a bunch of good stuff to resell, including a vintage leather Coach purse for $3, and brand new LL Bean boots for $2. 4. I had a poor experience at Kroger, and sent an email when I got home. They apologized and gave me a $15 store credit. 5. Not a frugal win for me, but I created one for someone else. I found a wallet in the street on my morning walk. I tracked down the owner online and they picked it up later that day, and sincerely thanked me. Reply That’s how you and I differ, as I love all the StarTrek series! Reply Thanks for letting me know about the Covid tests. I just ordered more. 1. We were supposed to have a yard sale Saturday and Sunday but it rained all day Saturday so we moved it to Sunday and Monday. My daughter and FIL both set up tables too. My son had to work but gave me a few things to sell. Between all of us we made over $700. The truck is full of leftovers and we are dropping it off tomorrow morning at our church thrift store. 2. I cooked in the crockpot both days to avoid takeout. 3. We gave several items to our neighbor that she was interested in for her grand kids. She brought us bagels as a thank you. Yummy. 4. A fan my FIL was trying to sell didn’t, so I kept if for our guest room. 5. My daughter and I did a fall deer painting class that was free at the library. I picked up 2 new to me puzzles while I was there. I dropped off 1 in return. Reply 1. Got my Covid shot today. I had already gotten a flu shot where I work, but they don’t have Covid vaccines. For that, I went to a CVS located inside a Target store. My Medicare card allowed me to get the shot free, no copayment, and I asked them about coupons; I’d read where some stores give you freebies for getting your vaccine with them. The pharmacist was just going to let me walk off without one, but since I spoke up, I got a coupon for $5 off a $20 purchase, good for 30 days. 2. We have new neighbors and they came and brought me some home-baked loaves of bread. He’s a home chef. 3. Signed up for more substitute teacher gigs. 4. Cut up more limbs and brush and put them out for garbage pickup. Hid them in 2 huge contractor’s bags which I put in the bottom of the regular trash can. Came home and they’re all gone….or at least THIS weekend’s batch was gone. Slowly but surely I am getting all the brush hauled off without paying the landfill fee to dump them. City Garbage Dept. only picks up brush twice monthly, so I have to get creative about disposing of same. 5. Went to the bank to check on my finances. All is well. Reply 1. Many years ago I gave my niece and her husband a dresser when they were first starting out as newlyweds. 12 years later she offered to give it back. I accepted as I have been saving to buy a new dresser for my new primary bedroom which will be in my addition, which isn’t quite finished. So now I can use that money elsewhere. 2. My cousin who lives on a nearby island had me over for two days, taking me out for dinner one night (which was lovely) and cooking for me one night (also lovely). He picked me up from the ferry terminal so I didn’t have to pay for my car. I also have a discount card for the ferry which saved me about $4. We went for a walk to a beautiful beach and had a picnic lunch from leftovers, some of which I had brought from home. It was a wonderful mini vacation for me. 3. Dh managed to remove two bathroom windows (without breaking them) which we can now sell. 4. Picking my own dahlias for a bouquet to decorate my Airbnb cottage whenever I have guests. 5. Gave my friend’s 88 year old mother some kale and cherry tomatoes out of my garden, and she gave me a jar of her strawberry jam. Reply 1. While doing some citizen science collecting water at a creek, found $8 in loonies ($1 coins) and twoonies ($2 coins). Took all but one, as they were sitting on a rock in the middle of a creek that was going to flood the next day. Whoot, $7 for the found money jar that I didn’t have until now. The next day, when back for another citizen science collection, I noted that the coin was gone, although the water hadn’t yet risen that far. It will be a mystery to me why those coins were there in that lovely neat pile. (down a very slick steep route – not a path, more like a slide, hold on to trees and hope you don’t misstep. Who would GO down there?) 2. Made fajitas with chicken legs I had cooked in the instant pot (bones back in the pot for broth), and discount purple and yellow peppers, as well as a couple of sad onions. I have made up a spice mix that saves me time when making mexican food, so the meal came together quickly with rice from a discount bag bought (ahem) a while ago. Homemade tomatillo salsa and some tortillas I had picked up on discount, I was in heaven. 3. Had a not-frugal 4 days as I flew a long way up north in my province to ask for signatures so that my political party will have a candidate in that riding for the upcoming provincial election. After two full days of talking to a LOT of very nice people, I successfully collected the required number of signatures (went out for insurance signatures, just in case) and completed the applicaiton with 1/2 day to spare. I am now the ‘paper’ candidate in that riding – where I have not a hope of being elected, due to some pretty divisive politics up there, however people who are looking for an alternative to the big two will have a choice on their ballots. Democracy for the win! (kind of…). My flight and hotel and car rental were paid, and I was very careful with the meals I purchased to save the party money – the hotel had a very good breakfast for free so I ate well in the morning then did without until evening. So glad to be home, though. 4. As mentioned in a comment above, I harvested a LOT of winter squash with the help of a young friend. It was SO much fun, and a lot of work – my lawn tractor trailer was full 4 times! I lent a pickup truck bed’s worth of squash to another young friend who needed them for his work (they were doing a photo-shoot) and I gave him two huge stalks of multiple sunflowers when he came over – might as well share them when they are perfect, eh? The remainder of the squash were washed with the help of Wonder James, and put into my grow room, resting on Bread Trays for air flow and under lights for curing. (best gardening hack – old bread trays are useful for so many things) 5. Got a huge load of firewood delivered (not frugal), and while Wonder James was stacking it in the woodshed/hayshed, he had to temporarily pull out the haybales. He came and knocked on my door with his shirt front bulging out – he had found a hidden chicken nest, and presented me with 18 eggs! GAH. Then, when I went out to check on things, I saw that he hadn’t brought in the nest I knew about (another 16 eggs) and THEN he started pulling eggs from between two bales. I think I have 8 dozen ‘found and questionable’ eggs! The birds had been suddenly unproductive about 2 weeks ago, so now I know where they were laying, instead…ANYWAY, I am using these eggs by washing them, ensuring they are lying flat while in the water (indication of age, if they float one end up they are older. Not BAD per-se, but older)/ Any ‘good’ ones I am breaking one-by-one into a small bowl before using, and they are all fine. The dog gets the partial floaters, if there are any. I am researching frozen quiches… 6. Oh, and if I haven’t mentioned it, I am now a grandmother of a lovely little boy – born August 30th. Was a last minute caesarian, so Mom and Dad were in a bit of shock, however this kiddo is just about the easiest baby one could imagine, so they are having a break there as mom recovers (and struggles with some issues). Both Mom and Dad caught covid, so I haven’t seen the baby for a week, hope to change that tomorrow, now that I am back from my travels Reply Congratulations Grandma!! Reply Fair play to you for spreading the plant love! 5 frugal things: * The cauliflower in Lidl has a price per piece and there just happened to be a piece in the box that was double the size of all the others so I did of course buy that very one! 🙂 There was enough for a side dish for one evening and for cauliflower cheese soup for the day after. * I attended several free talks as part of a local festival. * Somehow managed to rip my pants on the car and promptly mended them. * Found a beautiful handmade pottery dish and set it aside for the Christmas presents stash. * The teens declared a packet of grapes that I had gotten as “too soft” so I suggested they freeze the grapes and have them as a frozen snack. They didn’t love them but they ate them! Reply fwiw, I was curious and clicked on your Fetch referral link but it didn’t work for me: “app_not_found.” Thanks for all your frugal five posts, Katy. Wishing a very speedy continued recovery for your mom… Reply @Dmarie, I had the same problem, thought it was ’cause I am in Canada? Reply I just tried it and had the same problem and I’m in Colorado Reply 1. I mentioned getting a chest freezer in the last edition of 5 frugal things…but didn’t elaborate. It was $199 from a local grocery store and the store added $199 worth of coupons for free items to my account. Lots of snacks/treats…ice cream, pizza rolls etc. 2. I grabbed a gift for a birthday party from my “gift closet” – it was a board/card game I had gotten for free after a rebate. I put it in a recycled gift bag and used recycled tissue paper also. & My son made his friend a card. 3. I got a free jar of mayo from the local grocery store. It’s not something we’ll eat, so we’ll donate it to my son’s flag football food drive next week. 4. I have my bi-annual mammogram later today. Yesterday afternoon I got a call from my doctor’s office asking if I want to have my visit directly after the mammogram to save myself another trip to their office in a few weeks. Yes please! 5. I have a book on hold at the library that was recommended to me for my son (who is a history buff) Reply Leave a Comment Name * E-mail * Website Previous post: Five Frugal Things Get smart with the Thesis WordPress Theme from DIYthemes.

Title: Why Amazon’s Back To Work Order Is A Warning For The Future Of Work
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/annkowalsmith/2024/09/30/why-amazons-back-to-work-order-is-a-warning-for-the-future-of-work/

Amazon's return-to-work mandate threatens trust, collaboration and workplace culture. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy last week called all of the company’s employees back to the office five days a week, part of an effort to preserve the company’s culture and return to a pre-Covid reality. By clawing back the pre-pandemic era, Jassy reminded the world that companies have officially regained the upper hand — hiring, firing and changing the rules at will. And Amazon has certainly flexed that power, laying off more 27,000 of its workers since 2022 and now rescinding flexibility for the rest. Amazon’s decision isn’t just another episode in the return-to-work soap opera. It’s actually the canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem. The relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration. And that’s seriously eroding trust, which drives engagement, loyalty, belonging and performance. And leaders know this full well. PWC’s Invesco Dynamic Market ETF 2024 Trust Survey found that 93% of business executives say building and maintaining trust is critical to the bottom line. Yet only 23% of employees trust their company leaders to do the right thing. And 40% of employees don’t feel trusted by their leaders. Little wonder with so many companies using surveillance devices to measure keystrokes, police attendance and test loyalty. This is a far cry from the pandemic-promised “new normal”–a clean sheet of paper to design and build the winning workplace of the future. We imagined a place where productivity and flexibility worked hand in glove, where employees could learn, grow and collaborate in innovative new ways–together. But this vision has stalled–with whiplash-level force. Through the lens of Amazon’s actions, the workplace looks more like Game of Thrones: a battle to control and conquer rather than create a community of collaborative colleagues. Here are three ways we’re all going to lose if the battle continues. To state the obvious, the last few years have seen a lot of upheaval. First, demand for talent in a tight labor market empowered employees to make significant inroads in work-life balance. Employers offered flexible and hybrid work options, wellness benefits and rising wages. As the economy became uncertain, employers reclaimed control, leveraging an extraordinary number of layoffs that destabilized and disenfranchised workers. Flexible work had become a common, even expected, feature of the modern workplace, until many organizations, like Amazon, arbitrarily pulled employees back to offices. This power struggle takes a toll on both employees and the organization—replacing relationships with transactions. Employees are not widgets. Rapidly growing technologies, diverse generational norms and a tough competitive landscape are bringing seismic changes to the workplace, requiring individuals to work together more than ever. The transactional tenor of many recent workplace decisions forces people to protect themselves, to act competitively instead of collaboratively. Employees who trust that their employers have their back are 260% more motivated at work. When people feel valued, share a strong common purpose, and have invested in the skills to work better together, they are more innovative and collaborative. Turning the workplace into a zero-sum game undermines workers, erodes culture and damages productivity. As work becomes more transactional, the underlying social contract among colleagues becomes frayed. Many assume that the social contract is an agreement between employer and employee on treating each other with respect and consideration. That's not a social contract, it's a code of conduct. The social contract is the fabric that holds a company together. It's grounded on an understanding among colleagues, from the CEO to the front line, that collective success is powered by individual commitment–to the mission and more importantly to each other. Colleagues in an organization with a healthy social contract ask themselves, “what do we owe each other?” What does this look like in real time? A manufacturing executive in a company with a fledgling apprentice program for urban youth cosigning bank accounts so that they can build productive and fiscally sound habits. Another skipping a family dinner to help an apprentice with their algebra homework, because success at work starts with confidence and self-efficacy in life. Or a female software engineer who adds hours to her week mentoring younger women so that they can advance in their careers, finishing her own work late at night. An effective social contract requires a strong sense of agency, where each person has the power and autonomy to represent the organization and its values from a place of authenticity and belonging. Layoffs and work mandates rob employees, at all levels, of that agency. When they stop caring, they give up. And the social contract dies–taking productivity and profits to the grave. In his missive, Amazon CEO Jassy leans hard on culture, citing it as a critical success driver for the company. He justifies his decision to “strengthen” a face-to-face culture, where “collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.” What exactly does he mean by culture? Does it jive with what his employees believe the culture might be? Culture has come to loosely mean “how I like to work.” For example, the evidence is mounting that hybrid workplaces yield the strongest productivity and creativity. But for older leaders, the nostalgic pull of the watercooler remains steadfast. Many of Jassy’s frustrated employees (especially members of the massive water-bottle carrying generation who have no memories of the communal fountain) may describe Amazon’s culture as “toxic,” a commonly heard refrain when workers are at odds with their employers. Remember quiet quitting? Culture is not a weapon to be thrown around by the person with the largest muscle. Admittedly elusive, culture encompasses the norms and practices that guide the way we work together; it’s the how, not the where. It’s about productivity and engagement and a healthy social contract. And while it’s tough, it’s not impossible to take a more evidence-based approach (both qualitative and quantitative) to understand when it’s at its best. Until we agree on what a healthy culture looks like, it’s just another pawn in the workplace power struggle. The Amazon decision clearly signals the where-we-work conversation is not over. And although Amazon may have broken from the tech pack, we will now see other companies (tech and beyond) following suit with RTO orders. The only thing we know for sure is that the pendulum keeps swinging. When the economy gets tough, companies win the throne. In boom times, employees wrestle it back. And trust takes a hit every time. Sustainable success requires more than survival of the fittest. It’s time to end the battle and make an authentic commitment to working together. The future of work depends on putting away the sword and picking up the social contract. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse Gamble Pays Off With $201 Billion Fortune

Photo Credit: Meta Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity Mark Zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse initially looked like a colossal mistake, wiping more than $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,39,113 crore) from his net worth. But now it's paying off big-time. Buoyed by a record-high Meta Platforms share price, Zuckerberg's net worth has climbed almost sixfold in less than two years to $201 billion (roughly Rs. 16,86,617 crore), the first time he's exceeded the $200 billion mark (roughly Rs. 16,78,226 crore), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He's moved to fourth place on the list of the world's 500 richest people behind Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault. While other tech titans made big jumps in net worth this year — Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, for example, has more than doubled his wealth to $106.2 billion (roughly Rs.8,91,138 crore) — none has grown as much as Zuckerberg's. He's added $73.4 billion (roughly Rs. 6,15,908 crore) to his fortune since January 1, thanks to his 13 percent stake in Meta. The stock closed at an all-time high on Wednesday and is up 60 percent this year. It's a far cry from 2022, when the stock, and Zuckerberg's net worth, took a nosedive after his company had undergone massive changes, including a name change and big investments in the metaverse. At the time, Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity. Now, analysts think that the pivot from Facebook to Meta is finally coming to fruition as the company heavily leans into its Orion Augmented Reality glasses. “With the confluence of Meta's hardware improvements over the last five years and progress with AI, Orion represents Meta's evolution from a social media company to a Metaverse company,” JMP Securities analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. Since 2022, Meta has cut tens of thousands of employees, shrinking its global workforce by 25 percent. The Menlo Park, California-based company has made moves to improve its stock performance, including a $50 billion (roughly Rs. 4,18,928 crore) share buyback program and Meta's first-ever quarterly dividend. It has also hopped onto the Artificial-Intelligence (AI) bandwagon, spending heavily on data centers and computing power as Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in the industry-wide AI race. The company recently announced further investments into AI-generated creators, which interact one-on-one with online fans. Zuckerberg's public image has also changed dramatically from two years ago. Previously portrayed as a nerdy techie, the 40-year-old CEO has taken up wakesurfing and mixed martial arts. A photo of a seven-foot statue of his wife, Priscilla Chan, recently went viral on Instagram, with Zuckerberg claiming that he was “bringing back the Roman tradition of making sculptures of your wife.” He's also said he plans to stay out of politics. After earlier offering up his views on social justice, inequality and immigration issues, he has since publicly expressed regret about some of his political activity. “The political environment, I think I didn't have much sophistication around, and I think I just fundamentally misdiagnosed the problem,” he said during a live podcast event in San Francisco. © 2024 Bloomberg LP For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

On Monday, JPMorgan reiterated its Neutral rating on Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:OKTA) with a steady price target of $105.00. The firm's commentary followed a virtual investor meeting held last week in Asia with Okta's SVP of Investor Relations, Dave Gennarelli. The discussions covered a range of topics including the identity market, Okta's growth prospects, long-term potential, competitive dynamics, and recent events such as the FBI raid on Carahsoft. "The company continues to take a thoughtful approach toward building a competitive platform while balancing necessary investments with profitability," said JPMorgan analysts in a note. In other recent news, Okta Inc . has seen adjustments in its financial outlook following its second-quarter fiscal year 2025 results. The company reported a 16% year-over-year revenue increase to $646 million, primarily due to a 17% rise in subscription revenue. However, Okta's third-quarter calculated remaining performance obligations (cRPO) guidance fell short of projections. Analyst firms such as Piper Sandler and Canaccord Genuity adjusted their price targets for Okta to $100 and $90, respectively. In contrast, BMO Capital Markets raised its price target to $103, citing Okta's robust growth in remaining performance obligations. Deutsche Bank lowered its price target for Okta's shares to $115 while maintaining a Buy rating. To complement JPMorgan's analysis, recent data from InvestingPro offers additional context on Okta's financial position and market performance. Despite the company's focus on balancing investment and profitability, InvestingPro data shows that Okta was not profitable over the last twelve months, with an adjusted operating income of -$228 million. However, the company's gross profit margin stands at an impressive 75.82%, reflecting strong pricing power in its identity management offerings. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Okta holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide financial flexibility as it navigates market challenges and invests in growth. Additionally, 31 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, suggesting a potentially positive outlook that aligns with JPMorgan's steady price target. It's worth noting that Okta's stock has taken a significant hit over the last six months, with a price total return of -29.28%. This decline might present an opportunity for investors, as the RSI suggests the stock is in oversold territory. For those interested in a deeper dive into Okta's financials and market position, InvestingPro offers 10 additional tips that could inform investment decisions.

Title: Bernard Arnault leapfrogs Mark Zuckerberg on wealth rankings with $30 billion boost, but analysts warn it may be short lived
URL: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/30/bernard-arnault-mark-zuckerberg-wealth-lvmh-luxury-industry/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T10:54:46Z
Full Content:
The fortunes of luxury titan Bernard Arnault—and the raft of plush brands he oversees—seem to have turned around in the past week, courtesy of changing tides in China and a bet on a new fashion house. Per the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index, Arnault’s fortune leapt from $177 billion on Tuesday to $207 billion less than a week later. Bernard Arnault’s Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) has suffered a bumpy few months, down near-15% at the time of writing over the past half year. Its problems included Chinese consumers tightening their purse strings and a significant drop in its wine and spirits divisions. But in the past week Beijing has announced a raft of fiscal stimulus to boost consumers, and LVMH announced it has acquired a stake in Italian fashion house Moncler. A more optimistic regional outlook paired with new investment by the Parisian-based group has led to a surge in the business’s stock price. From Wednesday to Friday last week LVMH’s share price bounced 14% from €617.50 to €703.40 ($690.74 to $786.83). The bounce has led to a corresponding surge in Arnault’s fortunes—after all, he owns a 48% stake in the consumables giant. The 75-year-old entrepreneur saw his worth leap by approximately $30 billion—leapfrogging Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth to put him at number three on the rich list. However, Arnault still comes in behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. While being the third-richest person on the planet might be alright for some, Arnault as the former world’s richest man is unlikely to be satisfied. He reportedly once said: “As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy.” While LVMH rounded out last week with an indirect investment in outdoor apparel maker Moncler, Wall Street remains unconvinced that the luxury sector as a whole is still the best value for investors. LVMH bought a 10% stake in Double R, the investment vehicle owned by Remo Ruffini—the CEO of Moncler—and one of the brand’s largest shareholders. But while increasing LVMH’s influence over European luxury houses might have led to a temporary uptick, analysts are concerned prevailing winds will slow the sector further. A Bank of America note released last week declared: “The luxury consumer is all shopped out.” It added sector growth is likely to continue into the second half of this year and early next, leading to margin pressure and no EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) growth. Analysts downgraded LVMH from a ‘buy’ to a ‘neutral’ position—the same that was applied to Italian fashion house Zegna and Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci owner, Kering. Research analysts Ashley Wallace, Daria Nasledysheva, Ioanna Ziarti, Joffrey Bellicha Meller, Adam Gildea and Niccolo Serra urged the luxury sector to get customers back through the doors instead of relying on trends. “‘Quiet luxury’ has supported average selling price at the expense of volumes,” the group wrote. “The industry needs to pivot back to creativity, fashion content and newness at €1-2k ($1,100-$2,200) to drive higher engagement (as it did in 2016).” And despite hopes for a turnaround in China, BofA insists that its demand will be muted on a more permanent basis. Instead, analysts expect the U.S. to come through and account for more than 50% of sector growth in 2025 with the rest of the demand comprising of global tourists and the Middle East. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Exploding sales of prescription weight loss medications have catapulted Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) to become the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical companies. This relentless demand has not only led to ongoing shortages but also boosted Denmark’s GDP last year. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts project that the global market for GLP-1 prescription drugs could reach $105 billion by 2030. With so much money at stake, a range of companies — Costco (COST) among them — have begun offering these weight loss medications. Additionally, telehealth companies including Hims & Hers (HIMS) and Ro are also providing lower-cost, off-brand alternatives. And even a Kardashian has joined the fray with a supplement that taps into the hype. Check out these companies and others that have entered the weight loss market this year. 2 / 8 Ro was one of the first telehealth companies to start selling compounded semaglutide — an off-brand and cheaper version of the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy.

Title: Meta's SWOT analysis: AI-driven growth fuels stock optimism
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/metas-swot-analysis-aidriven-growth-fuels-stock-optimism-93CH-3638852

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has been making waves in the technology sector with its strong financial performance and strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). The company's recent earnings report and subsequent analyst updates have painted a picture of a tech giant poised for continued growth, despite facing challenges in an ever-evolving digital landscape. Meta's second quarter of 2024 showcased impressive results, with revenue growth of 23% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts. The company reported operating income of $14.8 billion and an operating margin of 38%, exceeding analyst expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) also surpassed estimates, coming in 7% to 10% above consensus projections. Looking ahead, Meta's guidance for the third quarter of 2024 suggests continued robust performance. Analysts are projecting revenue growth of over 20% year-over-year at the high end of the company's forecast range. This optimistic outlook has led several firms to raise their price targets for Meta's stock, with some analysts setting targets as high as $660. The company's financial strength is further underscored by its substantial cash reserves of $40.7 billion, which provide ample liquidity for ongoing investments and potential acquisitions. However, Meta's increased capital expenditure (capex) guidance for 2024 and 2025 has raised some eyebrows among analysts, with projections reaching up to $51 billion for fiscal year 2025. At the heart of Meta's recent success and future prospects lies its significant investments in AI technology. The company has effectively leveraged AI to enhance user engagement across its platforms and improve advertising efficiency. Meta's AI assistant is anticipated to become the most widely used globally by the end of the year, showcasing the company's progress in this critical area. Meta's AI initiatives extend beyond user-facing applications. The company has introduced AI Studio, a tool designed to enhance business messaging and sales interactions. Additionally, over one million advertisers are now using Meta's generative AI features, demonstrating the rapid adoption of these technologies within the company's ecosystem. The focus on AI is not limited to short-term gains. Meta's product development pipeline includes medium-term projects centered on AI chatbots, search capabilities, and business messaging, as well as long-term investments in the metaverse concept. This multi-faceted approach to innovation positions Meta to capitalize on emerging trends in digital interaction and commerce. Meta's core business of digital advertising continues to show strength, with the company outperforming many of its peers in the sector. Global advertising demand remains robust, with online commerce being the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. The company's ability to maintain strong revenue growth, even in the face of challenging year-over-year comparisons, speaks to the effectiveness of its advertising platform. The integration of AI into Meta's advertising tools is seen as a significant driver of future growth. These AI-powered solutions are improving ad delivery efficiency and return on ad spend for marketers, potentially leading to increased advertising budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Moreover, Meta is exploring new avenues for monetization across its family of apps. The scaling of WhatsApp and the launch of Threads present opportunities for additional revenue streams, although the full monetization potential of these platforms remains to be realized. While Meta's core advertising business thrives, the company continues to invest heavily in its Reality Labs division, which focuses on virtual and augmented reality technologies. This long-term bet on the metaverse concept has been a point of contention among analysts and investors. Reality Labs is expected to see increased operating losses in 2024, reflecting the substantial investments required to develop next-generation computing platforms. However, many analysts view these expenditures as necessary for Meta to position itself at the forefront of future technological shifts. The recent showcase of Meta's holographic, AI-enabled Orion glasses prototype at the Meta Connect developer conference has reignited interest in the company's AR/VR ambitions. While still in early stages, this technology demonstrates Meta's commitment to pushing the boundaries of immersive computing experiences. Meta's dominant position in social media and digital advertising provides a strong foundation for growth. The company's vast user base, with nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its services, offers a significant competitive advantage. This scale allows Meta to gather extensive data and refine its AI models, potentially widening the gap between itself and smaller competitors. However, the digital landscape remains fiercely competitive. Platforms like TikTok continue to challenge Meta for user attention, particularly among younger demographics. Additionally, tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are making their own strides in AI and augmented reality, ensuring that Meta must continue to innovate to maintain its market position. Despite Meta's strong performance and positive outlook, the company faces several risks and challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a persistent concern, with potential privacy regulations and antitrust measures posing threats to Meta's business model. The company must navigate these regulatory waters carefully to avoid significant disruptions to its operations. The substantial increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments, could pressure profit margins in the short term. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term growth, they may impact near-term financial performance. Privacy concerns continue to be a challenge for Meta, as the company balances data collection for advertising purposes with user privacy expectations. Any missteps in this area could lead to user backlash and potential regulatory action. Lastly, macroeconomic uncertainties and potential shifts in advertiser behavior present ongoing risks to Meta's revenue growth. The company must remain agile in adapting to changing market conditions and consumer preferences to sustain its current trajectory. Meta's significant increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments and Reality Labs, could put pressure on the company's profit margins in the short to medium term. Analysts have noted that the projected capex for fiscal year 2025 could reach up to $51 billion, a substantial increase from previous years. This elevated spending level may impact Meta's free cash flow and earnings per share growth in the near future. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term competitiveness, there is a risk that the returns on these investments may not materialize as quickly or as substantially as expected. Additionally, if advertising revenue growth slows due to market saturation or economic headwinds, the high fixed costs associated with these investments could lead to margin compression. Investors will need to closely monitor Meta's ability to balance these investments with maintaining profitability and shareholder returns. The company's management will be under pressure to demonstrate that these expenditures are translating into tangible benefits and future revenue streams. While Meta has shown impressive resilience in its advertising business, maintaining this growth trajectory in the face of intensifying competition presents a significant challenge. Platforms like TikTok have gained substantial market share, particularly among younger users, potentially threatening Meta's dominance in digital advertising. Moreover, changes in privacy regulations and platform policies, such as Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature, have made it more difficult for advertisers to target users effectively across platforms. This could lead to a shift in advertising budgets away from social media platforms like Meta's towards other channels. The company also faces competition from other tech giants investing heavily in AI and digital advertising capabilities. If Meta fails to stay ahead of the curve in terms of ad targeting efficiency and return on investment for advertisers, it could lose market share to competitors. Additionally, economic uncertainties and potential shifts in consumer behavior could impact overall advertising spend, making it challenging for Meta to maintain its current growth rates. The company will need to continuously innovate its advertising products and demonstrate superior ROI to advertisers to defend its market position and sustain revenue growth. Meta's substantial investments in artificial intelligence have the potential to create significant long-term value across multiple dimensions of its business. The company's focus on AI is already yielding tangible benefits in terms of user engagement and advertising efficiency. First, AI-driven improvements in content recommendation algorithms are enhancing user experiences across Meta's platforms. This increased engagement translates to more time spent on the apps, creating additional opportunities for advertising and monetization. The company's AI assistant, expected to become the most widely used globally by year-end, could open up new avenues for user interaction and data collection. Second, Meta's AI investments are revolutionizing its advertising platform. The introduction of generative AI features for advertisers is improving ad creation, targeting, and performance optimization. As these tools become more sophisticated, they could lead to higher return on ad spend for marketers, potentially increasing ad budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Third, AI is enabling Meta to explore new product categories and revenue streams. The development of AI chatbots and advanced search capabilities could position the company to compete in markets currently dominated by other tech giants. Additionally, AI-powered features in emerging platforms like WhatsApp business messaging could unlock new monetization opportunities. Lastly, Meta's long-term AI investments in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing are laying the groundwork for future innovations in augmented and virtual reality. These technologies could be crucial in realizing the company's metaverse ambitions, potentially creating entirely new markets and revenue sources. By continuing to invest heavily in AI research and development, Meta is positioning itself at the forefront of technological innovation. If successful, these investments could lead to sustained competitive advantages, new market opportunities, and long-term value creation for shareholders. Meta's ability to monetize emerging platforms such as WhatsApp and Threads represents a significant opportunity for future revenue growth. While these platforms currently contribute minimally to the company's bottom line, their large and growing user bases present substantial monetization potential. WhatsApp, with its massive global user base, offers particularly promising prospects. The platform's business messaging features are gaining traction, with Meta reporting increased adoption by advertisers and businesses. As the company continues to develop AI-powered tools for business interactions on WhatsApp, it could unlock new revenue streams through features like automated customer service, in-app purchases, and targeted advertising. Threads, Meta's recently launched text-based conversation app, has shown rapid user adoption. While still in its early stages, Threads could evolve into a significant platform for user engagement and, eventually, advertising. The app's integration with Instagram's existing user base and Meta's advanced ad targeting capabilities could make it an attractive option for advertisers looking to reach engaged audiences. Moreover, Meta's expertise in monetizing social platforms through advertising and its vast trove of user data position it well to develop effective monetization strategies for these emerging platforms. The company's ongoing investments in AI and machine learning could further enhance its ability to deliver personalized and relevant content and ads across all its apps, including WhatsApp and Threads. Successfully monetizing these platforms could diversify Meta's revenue streams, reducing its reliance on Facebook and Instagram advertising. This diversification could provide more stable and sustainable long-term growth, potentially leading to a higher valuation multiple for the company. However, Meta will need to carefully balance monetization efforts with user experience and privacy concerns to ensure the continued growth and engagement of these platforms. If executed successfully, the monetization of WhatsApp and Threads could represent a significant driver of future value for Meta and its shareholders.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. AI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies — especially generative AI — has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.

Financial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs. The retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.

Market Performance So Far: The USD/JPY pair has been under scrutiny since Shigeru Ishiba’s election as Japan’s new prime minister, with a drop of over 400 pips reflecting the market’s anticipation of potential policy shifts. Currently, the pair appears to be in a period of consolidation after the sharp decline, with traders focusing on the 144.30 level for signs of bearish price action. The market is still digesting Ishiba’s election and its broader implications, and traders may hesitate to make moves until more concrete policy direction is provided by the new government. Meanwhile, the broader USDX is showing mixed signals, having made a new weekly low on Friday, with traders eyeing this as a potential buying opportunity. The 99.00 level is seen as a critical support zone, and if the dollar index dips to this point, it could trigger a bullish reversal, especially if market sentiment turns in favor of the USD amid perceived risks stemming from Japan’s new foreign policy initiatives. In terms of the EUR/USD, there is a strong chance the pair could drop further from its current area, with a possibility of making one final push higher before retreating. Traders looking at bullish price action around the 1.1100 or 1.1040 zones may find opportunities, but the overall sentiment appears to lean towards a decline in the near term. GBP/USD is showing a similar pattern, with the potential for the pair to either come down from its current area or make one more push higher before reversing. If it does rise, the 1.3500 level becomes a key resistance point, and bearish price action around this zone will likely set the tone for the following week. However, if the pair declines sooner, the 1.3300 level could provide a solid area for a bullish reaction, offering some short-term opportunities for traders seeking to capitalize on volatility. Lastly, gold has continued its downward movement after testing resistance at 2670, with a potential consolidation expected, and bullish price action around the 2590 area could set the stage for a rebound. What’s Happening This Week: As we head into the first week of October, several key economic data points are expected to drive market movements. On Monday, Germany’s Preliminary CPI data is forecasted to come in at 0.1%, following a previous reading of -0.1%, which could influence the EUR/USD pair. On Tuesday, the focus shifts to high-impact U.S. reports, including the ISM Manufacturing PMI, expected at 47.6, and the JOLTS Jobs Opening report, with 7.64 million jobs forecasted. A weaker-than-expected JOLTS report could fuel speculation that the U.S. job market is softening, adding pressure to the dollar. On Wednesday, the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change takes center stage, with a forecast of 124K jobs added, and traders will be watching closely to see whether the actual data meets expectations. A stronger-than-expected ADP figure could reinforce the view that the U.S. labor market remains resilient, while a weaker figure could lead to dollar weakness. On Thursday, the ISM Services PMI is forecasted at 51.6, and any data supporting a strong U.S. services sector will likely reinforce dollar strength. The end of the week brings the most closely watched reports: Friday’s Non-Farm Employment Change and the Unemployment Rate. The Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data is forecasted at 144K, and the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A stronger-than-expected NFP report, combined with a stable unemployment rate, could drive the dollar higher, while a weaker NFP could lead to dollar softness. Markets will likely respond with heightened volatility around Friday’s release, making it an important day for traders in dollar-denominated assets. Welspun Corp announced the receipt of order from the Middle East for supply of Coated LSAW Pipes and Bends for sour service. Shares rise 1.77% on the NSE to ₹753.60. Here is the Live event updates Market is likely to move into a consolidation phase in the near-term. One significant factor that is influencing foreign portfolios is the outperformance of the Chinese stocks which is reflected in the massive surge in the Hang Seng index by around 18 % in September. This surge has been triggered by hopes of revival in the Chinese economy in response to the monetary and fiscal stimulus announced by the Chinese authorities. The cheap valuations of Chinese stocks are keeping the momentum intact. This can prove to be a tactical trade which can sustain for some more time. This means FIIs may continue to sell in India and move some more money to better performing markets. FII selling is unlikely to impact the Indian market significantly since the massive domestic money can easily absorb whatever the FIIs are selling. Investors can use dips to buy quality largecaps which are fairly valued. Crude oil prices recovered from their lows on Friday but prices fell last week amid demand concerns and higher supply from global oil markets. As per market sources, OPEC+ will increase production by 1,80,000 barrels per day each month starting from December. The Libyan dispute has also settled and its exports could resume soon. Also, the Chinese central bank announced a cut in RRR by 50 basis points and undertook stimulus measures to revive the Chinese economy thus supporting crude oil prices at lower levels. Escalating tensions in the Middle-East are also supporting crude oil prices. We expect crude oil prices to remain volatile in today’s session. Crude oil is having support at $67.55-66.90 and resistance at $69.10-69.80. In INR, crude oil has support at Rs5,630-5,570 while resistance is at Rs 5,775-5,840. Gold and silver prices rose for the third straight week in the global market after the U.S. Fed undertook big interest rate cuts in September. The dollar also weakened, which helped push prices higher. However, both metals dropped slightly from their record highs as some investors sold to book profits. Gold is nearing $2,700 per troy ounce, and silver recently hit its highest level in 11 years. Gold and silver are gaining strength because of interest rate cuts by central banks around the world, stimulus efforts from China, and rising global tensions. Gold has support at $2651-2640 while resistance is at $2684-2699. Silver has support at $31.42-31.24 while resistance is at 31.87-32.05. In INR terms, gold has support at Rs 74,750-74,570, while resistance is at Rs 75,190-75,380. Silver has support at Rs90,850-90,150, while resistance at Rs91,990-92,680.

This measure is expected to help increase the liquidity of privately placed InvIT units by allowing a broader base of investors to participate in the market and promote diversification of investment portfolios, enabling them to better manage risk, say industry experts. The latest relaxation is part of slew of changes now implemented by SEBI to its existing SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations 2014. We zoom in on the prospects of Rajesh Exports, as also the prospects of two other stocks — Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders and Mishtann Foods The dollar index oscillated up and down within a narrow range all through last week. The index traded in a range of 100.16-101.23. The immediate outlook is unclear. However, the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data release on Friday can keep the bias negative. The US 10Yr Treasury yield has declined on Friday following this data release. Here is what the charts say about the shares of Crest Ventures, Exide Industries and NMDC At current P/B multiple of 7.2 times, the price has already pulled forward many years of potential growth in net worth and the risk-reward of holding the stock at current levels is not favourable As record inflows via the SIP route continue and retail investor preference surges for mutual funds as long-term vehicles, asset management companies (AMCs) remain among the key beneficiaries. Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) is the fourth largest private bank in India. Over the years, it has been a good all-round performer in all three key aspects – balance sheet growth, asset quality and margins. However, now a host of challenges such as the embargo on the issue of new credit cards and a resultant drop in NIM, dropping CASA ratio and signs of stress in credit card accounts are stacked up for the management to overcome. Nifty 50 (26,179), the benchmark index, advanced 1.5 per cent last week. But Bank Nifty (53,834) ended the week flat as it declined on Friday, giving away the weekly gains made until then. Precious metals continued their upward march last week as well. In terms of dollars, gold and silver appreciated 1.4 per cent and 1.6 per cent last week and closed at $2,658 per ounce and $31.6 an ounce respectively. Crude oil prices dropped sharply last week. The Brent crude oil futures on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) was down 4.3 per cent and ended the week at $71.5 per barrel. Similarly, the crude oil futures on the MCX lost 4.7 per cent as it closed the week at ₹5,694 a barrel. Effective September 30, there will be changes in the constituents of Nifty 50, Nifty Bank and Nifty Next 50. Below is the list of the stocks that come in and the ones that are being replaced.

Experts say that this could rein in excessive speculative F&O trading. NLC India share price has been consolidating sideways for almost two months now. The price action on the charts indicate that this consolidation could come to an end soon. The combined market valuation of eight of the top-10 most valued firms surged ₹1,21,270.83 crore last week, with Reliance Industries becoming the biggest gainer, in line with an outstanding rally in benchmark equity indices. Last week, the BSE benchmark jumped 1,027.54 points or 1.21 per cent. The BSE Sensex hit its record high of 85,978.25 on Friday. The initial public offer (IPO) of Afcons Infrastructure, the flagship firm of Shapoorji Pallonji group, may be revised, likely upwards, with overwhelming interest coming in from institutional investors, but a decision on this is yet to be taken. While the fresh issue amounting to ₹1,250 crore that the company is raising, will remain the same, the offer for sale portion may see a revision. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have put in more money than any other category of investors in initial public offerings (IPOs) this year. FPI investments amount to ₹17,477 crore, which is 27 per cent of the ₹63,860 crore raised via IPOs this year. In comparison, domestic institutional investors (DII)-- comprising mutual funds, insurance firms, financial institutions and banks -- have invested ₹17,277 crore. Here’s an interesting stock idea: The stock idea that we have for you today is NLC India. The stock has been consolidating sideways now. The price action on the charts indicate that a bullish breakout is possible this week. That breakout can boost the momentum and take the share price higher in the coming days. Check out the latest episode of bl.Today’s Pick to learn more. The rise to 26,200 on the #Nifty happened last week in line with our expectation. The overall picture is still positive. #Nifty can continue to rise from here in the coming weeks. Supports are there to limit the downside. Any dip from here will be limited as fresh buyers are likely to come into the market at lower levels. Global trends, trading activity of foreign investors and domestic macroeconomic data announcements would dictate terms in the equity market in a holiday-shortened week ahead, analysts said. Equity markets would remain closed on Wednesday for Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti. “Looking ahead, it will be interesting to monitor Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and their flow into India. September saw the highest FII inflows into Indian equities this year. Movements in commodity prices, the US dollar index, and key macroeconomic data from the US will also be pivotal in shaping the market’s direction.

September 29, 2024 14:00 ET | Source: Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorney Advertising--Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (“CrowdStrike” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: CRWD) and certain of its officers. Class Definition This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired CrowdStrike securities between November 29, 2023, and July 29, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD. Case Details The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants repeatedly touted the efficacy of the Falcon platform while assuring investors that CrowdStrike’s technology was “validated, tested, and certified.” The Complaint alleges that these statements were false and misleading because Defendants had failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the Company’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. What's Next? A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to review a copy of the Complaint, you can visit the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD or you may contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Client Relations Manager, Nathan Miller, of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at 332-239-2660.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Fortune Swells To Over $200 Billion—The Metaverse Masterstroke
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/mark-zuckerbergs-fortune-swells-to-201-billion/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T17:00:26Z
Full Content:
The trek into the metaverse for Mark Zuckerberg has been anything but smooth. His once-risky bet, which cost him more than $100 billion, appears to be paying off handsomely now. His net worth has increased dramatically to $201 billion in less than two years, nearly sixfold. The skyrocketing stock price of Meta Platforms Inc., which has increased by about 60% just this year, is mostly the impetus for this surge. Consequently, Zuckerberg is once again the fourth richest person in the world, behind only Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault, and Elon Musk. Despite these amazing numbers, the metaverse remains controversy-ridden. While Zuckerberg maintains that it is the future of social interaction, many remain skeptical about it. Some doubters think Meta’s performance produced more loses than advantages. Some critics have argued that Zuckerberg’s fortune has been less in the metaverse concept itself than in his endeavors to benefit from recent AI leaps. Interestingly, Meta made huge financial stabilization efforts. This includes the initiation of its $50 billion share buyback program and also reduced 25% of its workforce for the sake of streamlining the organization. Zuckerberg continued to support the metaverse despite financial issues. He passionately discussed integrating the actual and virtual worlds at recent events, envisioning a period when people communicate via holograms or avatars. Nonetheless, a few shareholders and insiders are advising caution. They’ve voiced reservations about investing further funds in what many consider to be a project that is still a long way from becoming widely accepted. Furthermore, there’s a growing belief that Zuckerberg ought to focus on Meta’s main applications, which generate almost all of the company’s income: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. As the tech sector gets more competitive—especially with rivals like Google and Amazon making major advances in artificial intelligence— Zuckerberg might wish to rethink his goals. As Meta continues to introduce fresh goods, such as the Quest 3 VR helmet and Ray-Ban smart glasses, these innovations should eventually help the business to increase its income. Still, many investors who would rather see gains sooner rather than later harbor great skepticism. Future prosperity of the company will depend critically on its capacity to include fresh technologies into its current systems.

But I promised her I wouldn’t tell that story.) These days, she’s a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, an Emmy winner, and most recently, the creator of Joannabot, the AI chatbot that will tell you everything you need to know about the iPhone 16. (And apparently also do some other things, if you’re clever enough, but again, we’ll leave that alone.) I asked Joanna to share her homescreen because she just reviewed the iPhone 16, which means she just had to set up a homescreen. And because she’s forever using new gadgets and switching between things, I was curious what always made it to the top of the pile. Here’s Joanna’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why: I’m submitting my homescreen and my Control Center screen because I’m proud of the work I did on the Control Center. I may submit it for an award. But really, I’d like to just use this as a forum to complain about the all-in-one connectivity widget in the new Control Center in iOS 18. I don’t like it. I like the single buttons so I can easily just turn them on and off or long-press to get in there. Sadly, they have gotten rid of the single Wi-Fi button, but I read on this great website that it’s coming back in iOS 18.1. The phone: iPhone 16 Pro Max. The wallpaper: This is my dog Browser. It isn’t the best shot of him, but the framing is nice for putting him in the middle of the screen. My lockscreen wallpaper is this awesome retro iPod made by a designer named Shane Levine. I bought it through this site last year after featuring it in my newsletter. The apps: WSJ, ChatGPT, Apple Notes, Google Maps, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Instagram, YouTube, Clock, Threads, Signal, Photos, Slack, Spotify, Phone, Safari, Messages, Gmail. My apps are so basic and make me feel so basic. I work (Slack, Gmail). I message (Messages, Signal). I listen and watch things (YouTube, Spotify). I social media (Threads, Instagram). I work more (Google Docs, WSJ). If it isn’t on this main homescreen, I usually just search for it. Before iOS 18, I had a widget stack on the homescreen with weather and time zone widgets, but I moved it off to another screen. I might move it back. I might not. Got to live a little. I also asked Joanna to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she shared: Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. And for even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads. “Sliding Seas. It’s a match-three (or four!) game but also so much more: there’s real strategy required behind your moves to beat levels at the higher end, but it’s never unfair, and while there are in-app purchases and power-ups you can buy to make a level easier, you crucially never need to. It is the most compelling and well-suited-to-mobile game I’ve ever found and a gem I recommend without reservation.” – Jamie “Gisnep is another daily puzzle game, this time by David Friedman of Ironic Sans. It appears as a crossword-esque grid, but the words only go across and wrap around. The goal is to reveal both a quote and the source by filling in letters from vertical columns. I’ve gotten a number of my friends hooked already.” – Kyle “Satisfactory 1.0 launched a week ago or so. A great group of devs have effectively made a game that feels like work but is fun. If you love conveyor belts and staying up all night, this might be for you.” – Matt “Can’t believe you haven’t mentioned switching to OmniFocus! As a fellow perennial ‘task manager switcher,’ this app is a staple in my rotation.” – Pedro “I previously recommended App in the Air as a great travel companion, but unfortunately, it’s shutting down. If you’re looking for an alternative, Flighty is excellent, especially for travel stats, and they’re building an importer for App in the Air users.” – Vivian “We’ve been watching English Teacher on FX. Constant laughs and, so far, each episode has been better than the last. Easily one of the funniest shows on TV right now.” – Danial “I was gifted the Humanscale FR300 Ergonomic Foot Rocker, which is a very tech-sounding name for a very manual / mechanical rocking footrest. It’s very pleasant to use. I’ve also been standing on it sometimes... which I’m not sure is safe but sure is fun!” – Wisdom “Repeatedly putting in my Amazon cart the Black Milanese Loop for the Apple Watch Ultra 2. I was so close to buying it like three times. Now it’s out of stock. Even Apple says early November for shipping.” – Scott “Been playing with different LLMs using LM Studio. Integrated it into my Obsidian vault to help summarize and organize things into specific formats. It’s been extremely cool!” – Cody I’ve had back-to-back-to-back-to-back trips over the last two weeks, and I would just like to quickly shout out my new No. 1 travel hack: a wall charger that doubles as a big-ass portable battery. I have this Anker model, which is $55, charges a USB-C and a USB-A device simultaneously, and also charges itself so I can get 10,000mAh of power when there’s no outlet nearby. (There’s also a newer one with two USB-C ports and even faster charging but less battery capacity.) It’s huge and heavy, but this thing and a long cable are now the only charging gear I travel with, and they’re the only reasons my gadgets have survived trains and plane rides. Here at Installer, we love a sensible charging strategy, and this is as sensible as it gets.

With the backdrop of further expected Fed rate cuts, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing ... [+] at highs last week, are stocks overvalued? Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve recently delivered a larger-than-expected half-percentage point decrease in short-term interest rates, igniting another leg of the stock rally. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, markets have priced in a higher likelihood of avoiding recession and sent stocks to new highs. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 continued their march higher this week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the S&P 500 on the week and are now only 5.1% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 is almost 22% higher year-to-date, while the S&P 500 technology sector is nearly 30% higher. With the backdrop of the Fed rate cut cycle, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing at highs this week, are stocks overvalued? Stock Returns Trying to value the stock market is simple on the surface but is never easy. Since shareholders own a piece of an operating company, not just a piece of paper, stocks are valued based on the expected future cash flows accruing to shareholders. Complicating the process and providing the occasional opportunity for investors, prices are also impacted by human emotion. Based on a multiple of next year’s estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies produce profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Though ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average and argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. S&P 500: P/E & ROE Warren Buffett has said, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business, providing a good measure of the money accruing to us as owners. Free cash flow yield is the free cash flow divided by the stock price. Consistent with price-to-earnings, cash flow yield points to a stock market that is not cheap, though it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as investors having more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and, as will be illustrated, the superior fundamentals of the group. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield Like the exceptional return on equity noted earlier and supporting the rich stock valuations, profit margins are elevated relative to history. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that become bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are close to double the market as a whole, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. S&P 500: Profitability As noted, free cash flow yields look in the rearview mirror and don’t explicitly consider growth. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has grown free cash flow per share at a 5.1% annualized rate, while the technology sector has grown at a much faster 8.6% annualized rate. Both are impressive growth rates considering that this timeframe includes the COVID-19 economic shutdown, which saw the U.S. economy shrink at a 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2020. Technology’s superior free cash flow growth further reinforces why those stocks have been dominant, and their valuation is above the S&P 500. Free Cash Flow Growth As Buffett noted, the last piece of the puzzle is to discount those future owner’s cash flows to the present using an interest rate. All other things being equal, valuations should be lower for the same stream of profits when yields are higher and vice versa. Now that the Federal Reserve has begun reducing short-term interest rates, the expectation is that yields for longer-maturity bonds will also decline. Indeed, an analysis of past monetary easing cycles shows that stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Real Yields If one looks at how the more economically sensitive cyclical companies are performing versus the less sensitive defensives, stocks currently assign a lower risk of recession. In addition, consensus S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2025 call for 15% growth, according to FactSet. The soft landing does seem like how things should play out, but it is far from a certainty. Warren Buffett spoke to the situation when he said, “It’s been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance.” In other words, prices are usually high when the majority are optimistic. Cyclicals Versus Defensives So, where does this leave us in our answer to the question of stock valuation? It isn’t an easy or straightforward answer. As a means of defense, even Warren Buffett has said, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.” Investors have rightly sent stocks higher, particularly technology stocks, based on improving fundamentals, but that is the past. If one believes that the economy continues to chug along and free cash flow, perhaps driven by artificial intelligence, continues to grow at a robust pace, then stocks could be underpriced. Further, the leading technology companies have dominant competitive positions, and delivering intangible goods allows for profit margins and earnings growth rates that were not previously possible. There are reasonable arguments that artificial intelligence can lift profits across many industries, not just the technology sector. The challenging part is the current starting line of exceptional profit margins and above-average valuations, which leaves less margin for error since the future free cash flows matter to the valuation of businesses. In addition, the COVID-impacted economic cycle likely leaves our typical economic indicators less effective, so confidence in forecasts should be less than usual. Though it doesn’t feel that way, the risk of eventual disappointment is higher in stocks when valuations are above average, and forecasts are rosy. For long-term investors who can withstand the inevitable volatility, the discussion of overvaluation is moot since stocks have provided the highest after-inflation returns of any asset class despite the ups and downs throughout history. Since the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and risk tolerance. It is an excellent time to consider rebalancing to an appropriate risk level after the robust stock gains, especially in light of possible higher capital gains tax rates next year. In addition, owning some high-quality and less economically sensitive defensive stocks is analogous to buying an umbrella when it is sunny. The purchases are cheaper than when it rains, and investors will be happy to have them if it storms. Because some dominant technology companies have exceptional fundamentals and long-term outlooks, abandoning them altogether, barring evidence to the contrary, is unwise.

Title: FORD STOCK UPDATE: Investors of Ford Motor Company are Alerted of Imminent October 7 Deadline; Contact BFA Law if You Lost Money (NYSE:F)

September 29, 2024 06:36 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and certain of the Company’s senior executives. If you invested in Ford, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company. Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”). The 2Q24 Press Release revealed that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” It was reported that, in the second quarter, Ford’s warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago. This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.

Title: Angry Amazon employees are ‘rage applying’ for new jobs after Andy Jassy’s RTO mandate: ‘I will not go back’

Laura was working from home when her husband forwarded her a link to the news: Amazon tells employees to return to office five days a week. It was the first time the working mom, who has been with Amazon for over four years, learned she would need to add another four hours to her weekly commute. “At first, I didn’t quite believe it,” she tells Fortune. “After all, who expects to get career-altering news from a news article instead of your employer.” “Which, to be honest, is a pretty horrible way to find out about something that’s going to impact your life in a huge way. I really, really would have liked a personal communication from my manager, but that didn’t happen for a couple of days.” Laura says she was hired virtually during the pandemic with the understanding that there was no expectation to return to Amazon’s offices. That was, until 2023 when CEO Andy Jassy announced that he wanted workers to “go back to being in the office together the majority of the time”—at least, three days per week. “The original RTO mandate was a tough pill to swallow, but the latest one is impossible,” she says. After the initial shock of the news blew over, Laura says a sense of calm and clarity washed over: “My months of struggling to make three days a week are over, and I know that my time at Amazon has to end.” Even if she could commit to commuting into the office full time, Laura says she would still quit over Amazon’s remote work bait and switch. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” she adds. “I’ve been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.” Laura’s not alone: A handful of Amazon employees told Fortune that they’re so frustrated with the tech giant’s war on working from home that they’re officially on the job hunt. Two say they learned the news—and its implications—via the media, rather than a manager. One says they’ve already handed their notice in. Another says they’ve had two interview offers within 48 hours of the RTO announcement. Amazon did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly warned remote workers that it’s “not going to work out” for them at the company. Despite this, it’s clear that a number of Amazon employees (and managers, for that matter) have been ignoring the guidelines up until now. Experts previously told Fortune that Amazon’s 5-day mandate is a “negotiation game” to get employees in the office for the 3 days it originally asked for. “I was not complying,” Ben, who lives three hours away from an Amazon office, comments on the previous hybrid policy. He briefly considered moving before thinking again: “I decided not to make life choices as Amazon can fire me at will anyway, and I do not want to make long-term life changes because some manager decided I should start going to the office when I was hired virtual and promised I could work from wherever I want.” Some managers were still assuring their new hires could work from home after the 3-day mandate came into effect. One employee told Fortune that he was hired remotely in May 2023—a month after the company announced its initial RTO policy. “I left a decent company I live near to go to Amazon since it was working from home,” Luca, a millennial analyst, complains. “For me, it’s not that I don’t want to go in the office, there is no office close to me.” He says that his manager has been covering for his absence from any office, but that will no longer work. “He told me he would not be able to help, they’ve made him go into an office too,” Luca says, adding that he couldn’t get a firm answer on whether he will be expected to head into the office despite being promised otherwise in the interview room. “I like my job at Amazon, but I need firm ground to stand on and they are not providing that.” Whether Jassy’s latest move is to make employees show their faces more frequently or not, workers have until Jan. 2, 2025 (the date he’s given them to relocate if needed) to call his bluff—or quit. Most of the people Fortune spoke to think that Amazon is secretly hoping for the latter anyway. While Jassy positioned Amazon’s changes—which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking—as a better way to work, disgruntled employees are adamant that it’s a thinly veiled headcount reduction. “It’s a rob Peter to pay Paul situation of short-term gains from voluntary layoffs in exchange for losing top talent and reducing productivity for years to come,” Gen X program manager Jared says. Although he’s only been working at Amazon for six months, he’s already changed his LinkedIn status to #opentowork, reached out to former colleagues, and updated his resume in the hopes of finding a more flexible job before Jan. 2. “The new policy is less flexible than pre-COVID and does not respect the needs of employees to take care of their health, their family, or work-life balance,” Jared scoffs. “I will not go back.” While he was complying with the three-day policy, he refused to return to working in a cubicle five days a week when Amazon’s competitors are still offering some working from home—and he thinks many others will do the same. “As a top performer with prior MAANG (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) experience in this tight market, I believe it will be fairly easy to find a new role that is at least hybrid,” Jared adds. “One of my co-workers put in his notice on Monday. I expect others to follow.” He’s not wrong. Rumors of a stricter RTO were enough ammunition to inspire Ben to quit—he took “voluntary termination” two months ago and has now started his own firm. Likewise, Lisa, a marketing leader in Europe, has called time on her four years at Amazon. After hearing about Jassy’s announcement via the news, the 40-something says she immediately started reaching out to recruiters. “This new mandate goes against so many of the leadership principles that we supposedly hold so dear,” she says, adding that she has been a “top-rated employee year on year” thanks to working from home. “I’ve constantly delivered for this business and their reward is to order me back into the office, where I will sit at my desk either writing docs or sitting on calls,” Lisa adds. “I don’t want to work for a business that clearly has so little respect for me.” Every job that Lisa has applied for offers hybrid work, and she’s confident she’ll find a more flexible employer before the New Year. Within 48 hours of Amazon’s new policy going public, she had already secured two job interviews. “I will always work hard, but now I want to work for a company that works hard for me too.” Interviewee names have been changed for anonymity. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft downgraded, Micron rally ‘will sustain’

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! D.A. Davidson analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from a Buy to a Neutral rating on Monday, maintaining their $475 price target. The firm pointed to increasing competition in AI as the reason for the revision, noting that rivals have largely caught up to Microsoft’s AI capabilities. This, they argue, "reduces the justification for the current premium valuation." Microsoft’s stock has soared by 92% since January 2023, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, which gained 49% over the same period. But now, D.A. Davidson analysts believe that Microsoft's lead in cloud and AI is narrowing. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform (GCP) have demonstrated similar growth rates, which has closed the gap in cloud business expansion. “Our new proprietary hyperscaler semiconductor analysis indicates AWS and GCP are far ahead in terms of deploying their own silicon into their data centers, which gives them a significant advantage over Azure going forward,” they said in a note. Microsoft’s Maia chips are still behind Amazon and Google by several years, with their current use limited to Azure OpenAI Services workloads. This, according to D.A. Davidson, places Microsoft in a challenging position in the competitive data center landscape. Another concern raised by the analysts is Microsoft’s reliance on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for data center operations, which could lead to a shift of value from Microsoft shareholders to Nvidia’s. Microsoft’s operating margins are under pressure due to rising data center capital expenditures, which have jumped from 12% to 21% of revenue. “This is a higher rate of increase compared to Amazon and Google, a result of Microsoft’s greater reliance on NVIDIA,” analysts continued. “Every year Microsoft over-invests at these rates, it will diminish margins by at least 1pp in a cumulative manner. Microsoft would need to lay off ~10,000 employees for every year of over-investment in order to offset the margin drag.” Also, the firm expressed concerns about the sustainability of Azure’s revenue growth, hinting that it could be inflated by contributions from OpenAI's self-funded revenue. This week, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) kicked off its developer-focused event, Meta Connect, unveiling its latest hardware and software innovations. One of the key highlights was the launch of the Quest 3S, the newest virtual reality (VR) headset from Meta's Reality Labs division, offered at a more affordable price than its predecessor. Also, Meta introduced a new prototype of augmented reality (AR) smart glasses and revealed updates to its Meta AI chatbot. The chatbot now includes a voice interaction feature, allowing users to engage through both spoken and written commands. Here’s what analysts said after the event: Citi: “Meta’s new AI products, features, and devices announced at Connect ‘24 make us incrementally confident that its product innovation can deliver increased engagement and monetization as the ROI from its AI investments continues to expand.” Bank of America: “We think AI Glasses have much broader market potential than VR Googles. While Metaverse spend still seems hard to justify, with glasses long-term investors may have some renewed optimism on Meta’s opportunity to be at the forefront of the next generation of personal computing devices. “More importantly, the company appears to be successfully innovating around new AI capabilities, driving usage growth which can offset terminal value concerns, and we see Meta as the top AI pick in consumer Internet.” JMP Securities analysts said earlier this week that Google's enterprise AI adoption is accelerating, driven by increased use of its Gemini platform. "We are seeing signs that enterprise adoption of AI is inflecting." At Google's "Gemini at Work" event, the tech giant highlighted a 35x surge in Gemini platform usage, with 75% of daily users reporting improvements in work quality due to AI. JMP Securities views this as a clear signal of a turning point in enterprise AI adoption. The firm credits Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for removing barriers to AI adoption by achieving compliance with key standards like SOC 1, 2, 3, and HIPAA, and forging integration partnerships with major companies such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). These efforts have resulted in 85 new enterprise use cases over the past six months, driving meaningful cost savings and revenue growth opportunities for businesses. JMP Securities also stressed the growing importance of AI as corporations focus on technological transformation. Google’s integration of AI solutions with both first- and third-party data is improving accuracy and functionality, further boosting enterprise AI usage. The firm noted that generative AI usage by enterprises has surged 15x, while adoption of AI agents has grown by 6x. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) saw its shares jump nearly 15% on Thursday after delivering an optimistic first-quarter revenue outlook, driven by strong demand and pricing for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial to the rapidly expanding generative AI sector. The chipmaker, a key supplier to Nvidia, added approximately $15 billion to its market capitalization as its stock surged around 27% over the past three weeks. “It’s really not a good day to be short memory and semi-cap equipment stocks,” a Mizuho analyst remarked after the report’s release and Micron’s stock jump. “For the memory and semi cap equipment bears, I would advise against going down in a ball of flames and cover shorts and consider getting long some key semi winners even if you dislike MU and not willing to chase this 15%+ rip at the open,” the analyst added. “Personally, I think the MU rally will sustain and pull in many of these long/short haters who will flip from short to long at least for the near term.” Micron is shifting its focus away from lower-margin segments like PCs and smartphones to higher-margin, high-value products, such as HBM chips for servers and data centers. Mizuho highlighted that Micron management is confident their technology leads in both power and performance, outperforming competitors like SK Hynix and Samsung (KS:005930). Following Accenture's (NYSE:ACN) latest earnings report published this week, Piper Sandler analysts upgraded the stock from Neutral to Overweight, raising the price target to $395 from $329. Despite Accenture's overall FY25 guidance meeting expectations, analysts are optimistic about several underlying metrics. The company's first-quarter forecast exceeded consensus, with strong bookings of $20.2 billion and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x. moreover, Accenture’s workforce expanded significantly, adding 24,000 employees, marking a 3.2% quarter-over-quarter increase. “The setup for FY25 seems attractive as full-year guidance assumes no improvement beyond 1Q,” analysts wrote. One of the key growth drivers was in Generative AI (GenAI), where bookings and revenues grew approximately tenfold. In FY24, GenAI bookings hit $3 billion, with revenues of $900 million, up from $300 million and $100 million, respectively. “Importantly, the company is starting to see some scaled GenAI projects; and an increase in the number of data projects and security-related work ($9B in revenues, +23% growth),” Piper Sandler’s team noted. “Overall, we believe owning ACN is attractive, given improving top-line metrics, a conservative guide, and that it is a key beneficiary of GenAI-related work.”

The actor and aerial cinematographer turned his hobby of flying drones into a profitable business in 2012 just as the streaming wars were taking off. For a decade, he was flying high above film sets, creating sleek aerial shots for movies and TV shows on Netflix, Amazon and Disney. Now he’s on the verge of becoming homeless - again. He was evicted from the Huntington Beach home he shared with his wife and two young children and now is being booted from the Las Vegas apartment they moved to because they could no longer afford to live in Southern California. “We were saving to buy a house, we had money, we had done things the right way,” he says. “Two years ago, I didn't worry about going out to dinner with my wife and kids and spending 200 bucks." “Now I worry about going out and spending $5 on a value meal at McDonald's.” For over a decade, business was booming in Hollywood, with studios battling to catch up to new companies like Netflix and Hulu. But the good times ground to a halt in May 2023, when Hollywood’s writers went on strike. The strikes lasted multiple months and marked the first time since the 1960s that both writers and actors joined forces - effectively shutting down Hollywood production. But rather than roaring back, in the one year since the strikes ended, production has fizzled. Projects have been cancelled and production was cut across the city as jobs have dried up, with layoffs at many studios - most recently at Paramount. It had a second round of layoffs this week, as the storied movie company moves to cut 15% of its workforce ahead of a merger with the production company Skydance. Unemployment in film and TV in the United States was at 12.5% in August, but many think those numbers are actually much higher, because many film workers either do not file for unemployment benefits because they’re not eligible or they’ve exhausted those benefits after months of not working. As a whole, the number of US productions during the second quarter of 2024 was down about 40% compared to the same period in 2022. Globally, there was a 20% decline over that period, according to ProdPro, which tracks TV and film productions. That means fewer new movies and binge-worthy shows for us. But experts say the streaming boom wasn’t sustainable. And studios are trying to figure out how to be profitable in a new world when people don’t pay for cable TV funded by commercials. “The air has come out of the content bubble,” says Matthew Belloni, the founder of Puck News, which covers the entertainment industry. “Crisis is a good word. I try not to be alarmist, but crisis is what people are feeling.” Part of the boom was fuelled by Wall Street, where tech giants like Netflix saw record growth and studios, like Paramount, saw their share prices soar for adding their own streaming service offers. “It caused an overheating of the content market. There were 600 scripted live action series airing just a few years ago and then the stock market stopped rewarding that,” Mr Belloni says. “Netflix crashed – all the other companies crashed. Netflix has since recovered – but the others are really struggling to get to profitability.” And along with the streaming bubble bursting, some productions are also being lured away from California by attractive tax incentives in other states and countries. Los Angeles leaders are so concerned about the slowdown that Mayor Karen Bass created a task force last month to consider new incentives for film production in Hollywood. “The entertainment industry is critical to the economic vitality of the Los Angeles region,” Bass said announcing the plan, explaining it is a “cornerstone” of the city’s economy and supplies hundreds of thousands of jobs. Recent data shows the entertainment industry contributes over $115bn (£86bn) annually to the region's economy, with an employment base of over 681,000 people, the mayor said. The writers' and actors' strikes lasted for months and resulted in union contracts that offer more money and protections against artificial intelligence. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator with the Screen Actors Guild union, told the BBC that some consolidation in Hollywood was inevitable. He says he is optimistic that production will be ramping up soon. “What makes these companies special, what gives them their unique ability to create value is their relationship with creative talent,” he said while visiting a picket line outside a Disney office in September, where video game voice actors are currently on strike fighting for similar protections. Hollywood “always thinks it’s in crisis,” he says. “It is a town that constantly faces technological innovation - all kinds of change - which is part of the magic. Part of keeping content fresh is everyone having the idea that things don't always have to be the way they've been.” Mr Fortin’s drone company was operating nearly every day before the strikes. Now he’s flown the drones just 22 days in the year since the strikes ended. And as an actor - he often plays tough guys - he has worked just 10 days. He used to work as a background actor to get by, but the pay barely covers the gas money to get to Los Angeles from Las Vegas. “It was a great wave, and it crashed,” Mr Fortin said after a day flying his drones on the AppleTV+ show Platonic - his first gig with drones since April. “Things are coming in little by little,” he says in his van before driving back to Las Vegas for a court hearing to fight his eviction order. “Hollywood gave me everything,” he says. “But it feels like the industry has turned its back on lots of people, not just me.” A new filing presents the clearest view yet of how prosecutors would present their case against the former president at trial. The competition was delayed after a female bear was killed by a male rival in the Brooks River on Monday. Video from aboard the USS Bulkeley Destroyer stationed on the Eastern Mediterranean shows it firing an interceptor. Entire communities in North Carolina are coming to terms with devastating losses after a historic, deadly storm. Biden flew over storm-ravaged North Carolina, where tens of thousands of people remain without running water. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: Super Micro: Assessing the Potential Risk and Reward

Time Published: 2024-09-28T20:43:18Z

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) got off to an incredible start this year as shares more than quadrupled from January to mid-March. This surge made Super Micro eligible for S&P 500 inclusion, with the technology hardware stock (with links to AI) being added to the index on March 18, 2024. In hindsight, that would have been a great time to take profits or Short the stock, as shares are down by more than 50% since then. One of the major developments has been the report by Hindenburg Research, which contained worrying allegations about the company’s financial reporting. In assessing those allegations along with Super Micro’s fundamentals I hold a neutral rating on the stock. The Hindenburg report is actually the main reason I am neutral instead of bullish on SMCI stock, and I believe it has caused hesitancy among many AI stock analysts and investors. The accusations are pretty straightforward. According to Hindenburg, Super Micro engaged in accounting manipulation which included “sibling self-dealing and evading sanctions”. Anyone who thinks this sounds far fetched may wish to remember that the SEC charged Super Micro with widespread accounting violations in August 2020. Hindenburg’s report also argued that most of the people involved with that accounting malpractice are back on Super Micro’s team. Hindenburg’s team interviewed several Super Micro salespeople and employees when compiling their report. It doesn’t help that Super Micro delayed its 10-K filing to assess internal controls shortly after Hindenburg went public with its concerns. While this might simply be a coincidence, the timing is worrisome. Looking back several years, Super Micro had failed to file financial statements in 2018 and was briefly delisted from the Nasdaq as a result. Near the beginning of this month, Super Micro publicly issued a denial of the accusations, with CEO Charles Liang hitting back, stating that Hindenburg’s report contained, “misleading presentations of information”. Super Micro hasn’t provided any additional statements since then. Super Micro’s status as part of the fast moving world of AI is one of the few reasons that I am neutral instead of bearish SMCI stock. The exciting prospects for the company’s business and the serious nature of the Hindenburg allegations basically offset each other. It’s hard to know what’s real and what’s false here, but most people concede that the AI industry as a whole offers compelling growth prospects. Nvidia (NVDA) has been posting triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters. Other tech giants have incorporated artificial intelligence into their core businesses and delivered impressive results for their shareholders. For instance, Alphabet (GOOGL) saw its cloud revenue rise by 28.8% year-over-year as many businesses rushed to create their own AI tools. The artificial intelligence industry is also projected to maintain a 19.3% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2034, according to Precedence Research. The AI industry should continue to grow, and that should lift Super Micro. The company should benefit from Nvidia’s growth, which is why the company posted exceptional revenue and net income growth during Nvidia’s ascent. That’s what we saw for several quarters. We just don’t know how accurate all the numbers were, if the allegations targeting the firm have merit. While it’s impossible to overlook Hindenburg’s allegations against Super Micro, it’s still worthwhile assessing the company’s previous quarterly results. Shares were dropping even before Hindenburg released its report. While in March 2024 I argued that SMCI stock faced risks, I felt that shares presented a tremendous buying opportunity in late-summer, until Hindenburg muddied that optimism. For its last reported quarter, Super Micro posted net sales of $5.31 billion, representing a 143% year-over-year jump. Meanwhile, net income rose by 82% year-over-year, reaching $353 million. At the time of the release, my primary concern was Super Micro’s declining net profit margin. Super Micro currently trades at a 20x trailing P/E ratio, seemingly enough to compensate for any further erosion in profit margins. SMCI stock has a ridiculously low 13.6x forward P/E ratio, but with the recent speedbumps (the Hindenburg report and DOJ investigation) investors seems reluctant to bid the valuation multiple any higher right now. We don’t yet have tangible proof that Super Micro has engaged in any wrongdoing, as alleged by Hindenburg. Their report, however, has certainly cast a black eye on the stock. I expect that Super Micro would have significantly outperformed its fiscal 2023 results even excluding any misdealings. The Super Micro controversy added a new chapter on September 26, as news crossed the wires that the U.S. Department of Justice is now probing the company. SMCI stock tumbled an additional 12% on this news, and shares were recently trading at less than one-third of their all time high in March. There’s a high risk/reward on the shares at this point, but the elevated risks have relegated me to the sidelines with a neutral rating. Super Micro shares bounced back by more than 4% on Friday, September 27, suggesting that many investors believe that the long-term potential for the business is worth the heightened uncertainty. Although the ratings for this stock could change quickly, Super Micro currently has 2 Buy ratings, 10 Hold ratings, and 1 Sell rating from the 13 analysts that cover the stock. The average price target for SMCI is $613.92, which implies potential upside of nearly 50%. Again though, it’s quite possible that several research brokerages have placed their SMCI ratings under review. SMCI stock does have a few low price targets including $454, $375 and $325 from CFRA, Wells Fargo (WFC), and Susquehanna respectively. All of these price targets were established before the DOJ probe was announced, so even they could drop lower. There’s an old adage that suggests, “You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain”. That quote seems apropos for this company. Super Micro earned many investors hefty profits during its rise above a stock price of $1,000 per share. Those who entered the story late, including after SMCI stock was added to the S&P 500, have not fared well. Many investors are sitting on significant losses right now. Depending on what those investors do, it’s hard to tell how much more downside Super Micro shares may have until more clarity on the ordeals is available. If the company’s recent financials are accurate, SMCI shares look quite attractive here. Shares can surge quickly if the Hindenburg report loses relevance, although that outcome difficult to predict. I’m a big fan of Super Micro’s industry and business potential related to AI, which prevents me from being downright bearish. I have a neutral stance here. Meanwhile, I don’t expect shares of SMCI to rebound above $460 (the approximate price prior to news of the DOJ probe) without any resolution to the two main threats to shareholder value.

September 28, 2024 15:40 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike faced intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill on September 24 as lawmakers demanded answers for a catastrophic software update that crippled essential services across the nation. Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 – July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.) castigated the company's CEO, George Kurtz, for evading direct testimony and dispatching a subordinate to address the crisis. “This was a systemic failure with far-reaching consequences,” Green declared, “and we cannot let it happen again.” Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s senior vice president, offered a mea culpa for the incident, attributing the widespread outage to a faulty configuration update that caused a "Blue Screen of Death" on millions of Windows devices. However, his apology fell short of assuaging lawmakers' concerns. Congress’ interrogation of CrowdStrike comes on the heels of a September 12 report by SEMAFOR, wherein former CrowdStrike employees painted a picture of a company culture that prioritized speed over quality. Multiple sources described a workplace where mistakes were commonplace, and workers were often undertrained. One former manager even recalled warnings about the potential for catastrophic failures if the company continued to release untested products Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): The outage has also sparked litigation against CrowdStrike, with plaintiffs alleging that the company misled investors about the reliability of its flagship Falcon Sensor product. The complaint accuses CrowdStrike of failing to disclose significant risks associated with its update process and of downplaying the potential consequences of a major outage. The truth began to emerge on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down nearly 16% since the outage.

Title: How to Create AI Images: A Complete Guide With Expert Advice
URL: https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-create-ai-images-a-complete-guide-with-expert-advice/
Time Published: 2024-09-28T16:30:00Z
Full Content:
Here's what to know about creating AI-generated imagery, including the best programs, practical tips and legal considerations. AI image generators open up a world of creative possibilities. A picture is worth a thousand words. But with generative AI, you'll need to start with words to get that image. Generative artificial intelligence tech has exploded in the past few years, leading to a lot of creative services that can generate entire images and video clips. That's the "generative" aspect of gen AI -- it can produce content seemingly from just a simple text prompt. Of course, the actual process is more complicated. AI image generators rely on a database of existing content (text, images, videos, etc.), and/or scrape the open web for information to create new images to fulfill your request. They allow anyone with an account and a prompt to create almost any kind of image (usually within reason). There are a lot of AI image services available, but not all will deliver quality results or adequately protect your data. They also vary in price and features offered. While AI generators can be exciting to explore, getting started can quickly feel overwhelming. That's where this guide comes in handy. I've tested and reviewed multiple AI image generators for CNET and covered how the new tech affects digital creators. These services are certainly interesting and serve their purposes, but there’s a learning curve to them. While they're not good enough to replace human creators, they offer a range of creative possibilities. Here's how you can create custom AI images. I've had hands-on experience with many AI image generators and creative programs. The best program for you is going to depend on your project, budget and experience level. You can check out our full reviews and rankings, but these are my three program recommendations. CNET's Editor's Choice is Dall-E 3 by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. Dall-E boasts impressive prompt adherence, handling more complex prompts with ease. Its conversational flow -- meaning you can follow up easily by typing in the chat window -- allows for easy post-generation editing. Dall-E is also one of the more creative programs we've tested. You'll need a ChatGPT Plus account to access the program -- $20 per month -- and note that OpenAI may use your content for model training. But you can submit a request for it to stop training on your data. If you're looking for a free program, I recommend Leonardo AI. Canva recently acquired it, but you can still use it on its website. Leonardo offers a robust free plan, with more editing tools behind its paywall, and several artistic styles to choose from. It also provides a unique prompt improvement tool, which can take a simple idea and rewrite it, filling in details that make for beautiful end results. If you're really balling on a budget and have no creative experience, check out Canva's Magic Media generator. It's extremely intuitive and easy to navigate, which is great for beginners and non-creatives. Canva offers you 50 free credits for image generation (those are lifetime credits -- you'll have to upgrade for more credits on the paid Pro plan after using up your free tier allowance) and automatically opts you out of training its AI on your content. Once you've picked your program, create an account and make your way to the prompt window. Your best chance of success starts with a well-written prompt. Every prompt should include the basics of the characters, the setting, other elements and the image's dimensions. But to really hone in on the image you want, add descriptions of the artistic style you're looking to mimic, the aesthetic, vibe and specific colors. Leonardo might not understand a prompt that asks for "cottage core coastal grandma," but it does understand "rustic feel with blues and warm light." AI image generators rightfully have limitations around what you can generate. This is to prevent people from abusing these services to create illegal content and potentially dangerous or offensive content. For example, Dall-E 3 will decline to generate images that request public figures by name, like President Biden or Taylor Swift. Be sure to check out your service's safety policies before generating. Prompt engineering -- the process of writing the right prompt to get your desired results -- is something you get better at with practice. It also varies between each image generator. Canva, for example, tends to do better with simple prompts, whereas Dall-E encourages longer, more detailed prompts. Playing around with your program is the best way to get to know it. You can also check out my complete guide to image prompt engineering for more tips and tricks. Once you've got your best prompt, go ahead and generate! Even with the best generator, you're likely need to edit your images after they're created. Depending on the service you use, you may have access to editing tools or the ability to request changes. Be wary of over-editing your images. I've found that services can only handle so many changes before the image becomes too wonky, and ultimately unusable. Take this image I made in Midjourney as a cautionary tale of what happens when you over-edit. Sometimes it's best to start anew. Post-generation editing tools are one area where AI services tend to shine or fall flat. If your service doesn't offer them (or they don't work very well), try editing your prompt rather than the picture. In my experience, that's going to give you better odds of success rather than trying to incrementally edit existing images. It's extremely important to label your images as AI-created content. As AI image services improve, it's essential that all creators clearly identify the origins of an image, especially to distinguish it from human-created art and photography. In the bottom left corner, Meta AI watermarks all its AI-generated images. Some services automatically add a watermark or other marking indicating it's AI-generated, but too many don't, like Dall-E, Adobe Firefly, Midjourney, Canva and Leonardo. If you're sharing your image online, make sure to include the AI service you used in the caption, credit and/or alt text. You can also add a disclaimer to your posts if you're sharing on social media -- Meta might flag them as containing AI content on Instagram and Facebook, but adding a line to your caption will help ensure there isn't any confusion. As of publication, the use of AI image generators is legal. But there are important legal and ethical considerations you should be aware of when creating AI images. Here are a couple of quick frequently asked questions. AI image services like Midjourney and Dall-E rely on existing content to help them create pictures. This content, either in a database or on the open web, is typically created by humans. As such, some creators and artists have major concerns about how these programs are designed and trained. That's led to uproar in the industry and a couple of notable lawsuits, including an ongoing case against Stable Diffusion, an AI model used by popular generators. If you're worried about using a service that might potentially mistreat creators, pick one that clearly discloses how it trains its model. Some AI services rely on public databases, like Adobe Stock and Getty Images, where creators sign agreements with the companies to enter their work into those collections for specific uses. Adobe Firefly, for example, says it only uses content from its Adobe Stock public databases and images whose copyrights have expired. It also won't train on your content. As these AI services evolve, the legalities and ethics around them are poised to change as well. If you're going to be a regular AI art creator, make sure you stay up to date with the latest requirements, which we'll cover in our AI Atlas guide.

Title: BMO maintains Outperform rating on Costco stock, citing strong customer trends
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bmo-maintains-outperform-rating-on-costco-stock-citing-strong-customer-trends-93CH-3637612

Full Content:
On Friday, BMO Capital adjusted its outlook on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), raising the stock's price target from $950.00 to $980.00. The firm has maintained an Outperform rating for the retailer. The revision follows Costco's reported earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, which showed strong performance indicators, including better-than-expected gross margin percentages and comparable sales. The company's recent earnings report highlighted a robust increase in global customer traffic, up by 6%, with a significant 11-12% rise on a two-year stack basis. The strong performance metrics have led to an above-average growth in earnings per share (EPS) for the fiscal year 2024. Despite this growth, BMO Capital projects a more conservative EPS growth rate in the coming years, taking into account Costco's pattern of reinvesting market funds incrementally (MFI) increases. Costco's momentum in E-commerce was also a notable point in the analysis by BMO Capital. The retailer's continued expansion in the digital space is seen as a positive driver of its business model. While acknowledging that the company's valuation has reached new heights, the firm still finds Costco's stock attractive, citing the slightly higher EPS revisions as a basis for the increased price target. The analyst from BMO Capital highlighted the company's solid underlying financials in the fourth fiscal quarter, which surpassed the firm's forecasts. The statement underscored the strength in gross margins and comparable sales, which contributed to the positive outlook. "We continue to be encouraged by COST's momentum in Ecommerce growth and while valuation has expanded to new highs, COST remains attractive in our view," said the analyst from BMO Capital. With the new price target set at $980, BMO Capital's stance reflects confidence in Costco's ongoing growth trajectory and its ability to maintain a strong position in the market. The firm's analysis suggests a belief in the retailer's strategic investments and its potential for sustained financial success. In other recent news, Costco Wholesale reported mixed results in its fourth-quarter earnings, with earnings per share (EPS) of $5.29 surpassing both Goldman Sachs and consensus estimates, but falling slightly short on its revenue target of $79.70 billion. Despite the slight miss, same-store sales witnessed a 6.9% increase, exceeding the anticipated 6.4%. In response to potential disruptions due to a possible strike at U.S. ports, Costco's CEO, Ron Vachris, outlined extensive contingency plans. The company's recent performance has led to varied reactions from analyst firms. Baird maintains an Outperform rating on Costco with a price target of $975, highlighting the company's strong comparable sales momentum and healthy membership key performance indicators. However, Roth/MKM, DA Davidson, and Citi have maintained a Neutral stance, while Truist Securities, Redburn-Atlantic have expressed valuation concerns, downgrading or maintaining neutral stances on the company's shares. Goldman Sachs remains optimistic, maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target to $995. These are recent developments for Costco Wholesale. As BMO Capital raises its price target for Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), it's important to note some key financial metrics and insights that underscore the retailer's market position and valuation. According to InvestingPro data, Costco boasts a significant market capitalization of $399.64 billion, reflecting its substantial presence in the industry. The company's P/E ratio stands at a high 55.9, which, while indicative of investor confidence, also points to a premium valuation relative to near-term earnings growth. This is further emphasized by a PEG ratio of 2.86, suggesting that the market may be pricing in optimistic growth expectations. Costco's revenue growth remains healthy, with a 7.75% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024, and a gross profit margin of 12.5%, which, although solid, may be considered modest in comparison to some industry peers. It's also noteworthy that Costco has maintained dividend payments for 21 consecutive years, with a recent dividend yield of 0.51% and a 13.73% dividend growth in the same period. This consistent return to shareholders reflects the company's financial health and disciplined capital management. InvestingPro Tips highlight that while Costco is trading at high earnings and EBITDA valuation multiples, it holds more cash than debt, indicating a strong balance sheet. Additionally, the company's cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, providing further evidence of its financial stability. For those seeking more in-depth analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips, with a total of 15 tips available that delve into Costco's performance and market valuation. Costco's strategic positioning as a prominent player in the Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail industry, combined with its strong return over the last year, suggests that the company is well-equipped to navigate market challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities.

Title: CRWD IMPORTANT DEADLINE: ROSEN, SKILLED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. Investors with Losses in Excess of $100K to Secure Counsel Before Important September 30 Deadline in Securities Class Action – CRWD

September 28, 2024 08:07 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Meta Debuts the Quest 3S, Its Cheapest Mixed-Reality Headset
URL: https://www.online-tech-tips.com/meta-debuts-the-quest-3s-its-cheapest-mixed-reality-headset/
Time Published: 2024-09-28T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
Meta announced several products at its Meta Connect 2024 event in California, but Quest 3S stood out for many reasons. It’s the company’s cheapest mixed-reality headset, featuring a similar chipset (Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2) and software functionalities as the older and pricier Meta Quest 3. Meta Quest 3S features a refreshed Meta Horizon OS that better supports 2D applications. Meta says the new OS will also deliver improved spatial audio and better Passthrough contrast and color. The new Quest 3S is compatible with all applications and games in the Meta Store. Also, the headset comes bundled with exclusive games (like Batman: Arkham Shadow) and Quest 3-specific performance updates. Despite sharing a similar form factor, the Quest 3S and Quest 3 have varying display quality, optical lenses, and camera setups. The new Quest 3S has its sensors and Fresnel lenses arranged in triangular clusters, while the Quest 3’s Pancake lenses and sensors have a pill-shaped setup. Additionally, Quest 3 has a better display (2,064 x 2,208 pixels per eye) and will provide more realistic graphics and sharper videos than the Quest 3S (1832 x 1920 pixels per eye). The Quest 3 remains Meta’s most powerful mixed-reality headset. However, the new Quest 3S doesn’t seem like a watered-down version, especially spec-wise. Quest 3S starts at $299.99 for the base (128GB) version and $399.99 for 256GB, while the 512GB version will retail for $499.99. Interested buyers can pre-order the Quest 3S from Meta’s website before it hits the shelves on October 15. In other news, the retail price for the 512GB Meta Quest 3 is dropping from $649.99 to $499.99. Meta is also discontinuing the Quest 2 and Quest Pro. The company says it’ll sell whatever’s left of both models through the end of 2024 or until they’re out of stock. According to Meta, the new Quest 3S will provide outstanding value “both for those new to VR and those looking to upgrade from Quest or Quest 2.

Here's your firmware update for September 28, 2024 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. What a week this was, folks. Meta Connect 2024 introduced us to a new VR headset, its first AR glasses prototype and slew of Meta AI upgrades – including an in-development skill to live dub Instagram reels. We also said hello to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, reviewed the new Legend of Zelda title, and prepared ourselves for heartbreak in 2025 with the arrival of The Last of Us season 2's first teaser trailer. In case you missed all that, we've rounded up all of these top tech news stories below so you can get up to speed on everything that happened in the last seven days. On Tuesday (September 24), Nothing unveiled its inaugural set of open-ear buds and TechRadar’s audio editor couldn’t help but share her initial thoughts. She’d already said she thought it was the best idea Nothing's had in ages (questionable ‘Ear Open’ moniker aside), and after slipping them on for a few hours, they didn’t disappoint. Ear Open are so very Nothing; their friendly praying mantis aesthetic is so very likeable. And just as the company's Nothing Ear (a) impressed for a competitive fee, these buds are likely to be a huge hit in the open-ear space. That's particularly true given that they cost just £129, ie. the same price as the flagship Nothing Ear (which means your US and Australian prices are almost certainly $149 / AU$249). Compare that to the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, with their $299 / £299 / AU$449.95 price-point. See? Slip 'em on and they feel like nothing, too. The fit is excellent – even putting both on at the same time is a cinch. You get the trademark transparent-meets-monochrome-meets-titanium Nothing design language, plus on-ear pinch control, although there’s a knack to it now, purely because you need to locate where the old 'stem' idea is, to pinch. Oh, and the Advanced EQ setting? It's another level… We won't be surprised if not too many Nintendo fans are reading this, because right now they're probably all playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. This highly anticipated entry in the long-running Nintendo franchise is something of a landmark, letting players explore Hyrule through the eyes of Princess Zelda for the first time. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And the good news is that it's great. It combines elements from classic Zelda titles with a wealth of new mechanics for an adventure quite unlike anything that we’ve seen before. Tasked with closing sinister rifts that threaten the kingdom, you journey through a charming open-world and experiment with a suite of magical abilities. These let you create copies of certain objects whenever you need, which is just as fun as it sounds; a summoned bed might be good for a quick nap in isolation, but makes for the perfect bridge over a perilous chasm when multiplied and stacked. You can even spawn friendly versions of enemies to fight on your behalf. It’s all wrapped up in an adorable art direction, making everything from the characters to the world look like it was plucked straight from a cute diorama. Check out our review below. This week we were treated to our first new trailer for The Last of Us season 2, and we’re convinced it's going to be as emotionally devastating as the videogame it’s based on. Released as part of this year’s The Last of Us Day celebrations (September 26 is the day the Cordyceps infection ravaged the world of the game/show) we got both a two-minute S2 teaser and a confirmation that it’s coming sometime in 2025. The teaser gives us our first glimpse of characters players know from the games, including Abby and Ellie's love interest Dina, as well as providing hints at what Ellie and Joel have been up to following the 'five years of peace' that followed the events of season 1. Fans of the games know it’s not all sunshine and roses for the survivors, though, so we’re going to take these next few months to emotionally prepare ourselves for what The Last of Us has in store for us come 2025. Samsung launched the Galaxy S24 FE alongside the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra this week, and the new phone looks like it’ll prove the cheapest route into Samsung’s Galaxy AI ecosystem. Among the S24 FE’s hardware upgrades over the Galaxy S23 FE are a bigger 6.7-inch display, a new Exynos 2400e chipset, and longer battery life. But while that would be enough to make it a contender in the cheap flagship stakes, it's the phone's AI tricks that we're most excited about. Chief among them are its AI-powered ProVisual photography engine, which it inherits from the standard Galaxy S24 and which should bring improved low-light performance and optical zoom quality. In our hands-on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE review, we described Samsung’s new device as “a great value phone for its power and features,” so here’s hoping it lives up to that billing once we’ve put it through our full review process. 3. Meta’s affordable Meta Quest 3S broke cover The least surprising announcement of Meta Connect 2024 was nevertheless an exciting one – the much-leaked Meta Quest 3S. This affordable alternative to the Meta Quest 3 still packs a solid punch with its Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, and 8GB of RAM, but only costs $299.99 / £289.99 / AU$499.99. In exchange you will have to accept a couple of downgrades – less sharp displays, a bulkier body, and the loss of the depth sensor – but by all accounts the Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset at its price, and looks like it could be perfect for people looking to dip their toes into XR as we head into the holiday season. We also saw Meta’s first fully functional AR glasses – the Orion prototypes. These aren’t something anyone will be able to buy (though some are being given out as developer kits to help software creators make apps for the official specs), but from what we’ve been shown Orion looks amazing. And it’s only set to get better, with Mark Zuckerberg promising the consumer pair will boast better displays, a more fashionable design, and a more affordable price. Although on that last point, Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth later clarified that Meta meant affordable in terms of smartphone and laptops rather than at “a Quest 3S price point, or even a Quest 3 price point.” It suddenly feels rather like 2020 all over again. That's because pre-orders for the forthcoming PS5 Pro and the limited-edition PS5 30th Anniversary Collection went on sale this week – with predictable results. Such as? Well, such as the official PlayStation Direct website quickly being inundated with would-be buyers all eager to get their hands on Sony’s upcoming consoles and kit. Many had to wait in digital queues for upwards of an hour, just to be in with a chance of pre-ordering the mid-gen refresh, and there were reports of crashes and timeouts and (inevitably) scalpers. Most PlayStation Direct stock sold out completely that same day; the 30th Anniversary Edition bundle was gone in minutes across the US and UK, while the limited-edition PS5 Slim, DualSense Edge and PlayStation Portal models were quick to follow. Some stock still held on, however, and at the time of writing, Sony’s website still has PS5 Pro units available to pre-order.

Title: Grayscale’s Bullish Forecast: The Top 20 Crypto To Watch In Q4
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/grayscales-bullish-forecast-the-top-20-crypto-to-watch-in-q4/
Time Published: 2024-09-28T05:00:30Z
Full Content:
Crypto asset manager Grayscale has published an in-depth report outlining sectors poised for bullish growth in the final quarter of the year amid a notable recovery in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for major players such as Bitcoin (BTC) and various altcoins, which have reached price levels not seen in over two months. In its Thursday report, Grayscale updated its Crypto Sectors Indexes, showcasing emerging themes within the digital asset industry. Key trends include the rise of decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, efforts to tokenize traditional assets, and the growing popularity of memecoins. Notably, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector have outperformed other market segments in 2024, likely due to the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US earlier this year and favorable macroeconomic conditions following the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate cut on 18 September. While gaining 13% this year, Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin but still surpassed many other cryptocurrencies. Grayscale’s Crypto Sectors Market Index (CSMI) has seen a slight decline of about 1% year-to-date, with the Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector Index down approximately 11%, making Ethereum’s performance relatively stronger than its peers. Despite its challenges, the asset manager finds that Ethereum remains the Smart Contract Platforms sector leader, boasting the highest number of applications, developers, and fee revenue. In producing its quarterly Top 20 list of cryptocurrencies, Grayscale thoroughly analyzes hundreds of digital assets. This list represents a diversified selection of assets with high potential for the upcoming quarter. Among those highlighted by the firm are standout performers such as Sui (SUI), Bittensor (TAO), Optimism (OP), Helium (HNT), Celo (CELO) and the UMA Protocol (UMA). However, below is the full list with other assets beyond these to which Grayscale pays particular attention. Sui, a third-generation blockchain created by former Meta engineers, has made waves following a recent network upgrade that enhanced its transaction speed by 80%, surpassing Solana’s capabilities. Optimism, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, plays a critical role in scaling the Ethereum network. It has developed a framework called the “Superchain,” which is utilized by platforms like Coinbase’s Layer 2 BASE. Celo and UMA are capitalizing on unique trends, with Celo focusing on stablecoin use and payment solutions in developing regions, particularly in Africa. The platform recently surpassed Tron in stablecoin usage, while UMA serves as an oracle network for decentralized applications like Polymarket. Helium’s inclusion in the Top 20 reflects Grayscale’s preference for category leaders with sustainable revenue models. The project has established itself as a leader in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), growing its network to over one million hotspots and generating significant fee revenues. Bittensor, which focuses on the intersection of AI and crypto, has recently gained recognition within Grayscale’s framework due to improvements in market structure, offering a decentralized platform for AI innovation. In this quarter’s adjustments, Grayscale has rotated out several assets, including Render, Mantle, ThorChain, Pendle, Illuvium, and Raydium. While Grayscale sees value in these projects, the revised Top 20 list aims to offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns for investors in the coming months. At the time of writing, the biggest winner across all time frames in Grayscale’s top 20 list is Bittensor’s TAO token, which has seen gains of 86% over the fourteen-day time frame and a substantial 841% year-to-date, resulting in a current trading price of $536.
