President Trump and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy met to discuss a new peace plan. Zelenskyy called it a great meeting, suggesting a deal is near. However, Russia's aides dismissed several proposals. The plan covers security, rebuilding, and prisoner exchanges. Key disagreements remain over territory in Donetsk and a nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia. The US also sees economic opportunities in Ukraine's reconstruction.

Title: Streamer Report Card: Streaming Reached A Profit Turning Point In 2025, But Major Players Still Wonder How To Measure Success
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/12/streaming-report-card-2025-1236651338/
Time Published: 2025-12-28T20:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Dade Hayes, Katie Campione After more than five years of gushing red ink, 2025 was the year when streaming across the board started to turn a profit. There are caveats attached to that statement, of course. NBCUniversal’s Peacock is still making losses, and Apple TV’s economics are impossible to disentangle from its trillion-dollar parent company’s, but nevertheless the year in general will go down as a milestone. With that long-sought economic maturity has come greater scrutiny of the balance sheet. Although it sometimes feels like streaming is the only arena that counts, a recent report from Morgan Stanley media analysts noted that spending on linear TV remains about double that on streaming. Gone are the days of the firehose of content; even the sector leader, Netflix, has held the line on content expenses of late. In 2026, Morgan Stanley predicts, “streaming market repair” will be a key phrase across the sector, as “corporate spin-offs and continued cord-cutting are rapidly shrinking legacy TV as an investment factor.” Watch on Deadline Streaming remained a headline-grabber this year even before a game-changing deal centering on the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery (with Netflix and Paramount both in hot pursuit as of this writing) was finalized. Disney launched a beefed up new ESPN app, which blends linear feeds from more than a dozen of its networks with a range of streaming-only fare. Fox Corp., for similar strategic reasons, launched its own flagship, Fox One. While profits and losses are probably the ultimate measure of success, the metrics of streaming underwent a rethink this year, with Netflix and Disney announcing plans to phase out quarterly reports of subscriber numbers. Revenue per user, engagement and other metrics are now en vogue, though success or failure in streaming, as ever, is subject to interpretation. Below, in alphabetical order, are the top streaming players and Deadline’s view about how they fared in 2025 as well as what they’re facing next year. This is intended as a comprehensive look at these services – programming, product and overall status in the field, not just value as M&A chess pieces. 2025 Highlight: Severance. The show returned for its second season this year and quickly became both a critical and cultural darling. It earned 27 Emmy nominations and won eight, including Outstanding Lead Actress for Britt Lower and Outstanding Supporting Actor for Tramell Tillman. The streamer is also closing out the year on a high note with Vince Gilligan’s Pluribus, which is already shaping up to be a strong awards contender after earning Rhea Seehorn a Golden Globe nomination. It would be wrong not to acknowledge that F1 scored Apple’s biggest ever box office opening this year, too, via a distribution deal with Warner Bros. 2025 Lowlight: The streaming era has brought about many conundrums, and one that it appears has confounded multiple media companies is what the heck to call their service. While not nearly as egregious as the HBO Max debacle, Apple TV quietly rebranded earlier this year too, removing the “+” sign due to apparent confusion it caused. The problem? It only created more confusion, given that Apple TV is also the name of the streaming hardware it sells, as well as the name of the app within the device. Challenge for 2026: Eddy Cue, Senior Vice President of Services at Apple, admitted in October that the streamer has experienced a few setbacks that have left it “a little further behind than where I’d like to be.” While he pushed back on claims that the service’s subscriber numbers sit around 45M, arguing that it is “significantly more than that,” the point remains that Apple seems to still be small potatoes in the streaming world despite some heavyweight content. The streamer’s financials are reported as part of Apple’s overall services business, lumping them in with music, cloud storage and other operations, but the streamer clearly seems to have a ways to go before it’s in the big leagues. Biggest question for 2026: What is the tech giant’s next move in streaming? As all the chess pieces are moving rapidly across the board, Apple is a peculiar one that seems to have removed itself from the whims of the streaming wars. Apple TV remains the only premium streaming service without an ad tier. The company is also decidedly not joining the furor over Warner Bros. So, it begs the question, will Apple make any big moves next year, or quietly stick to what works? 2025 Highlight: ESPN’s streaming service finally has something to offer. For years, Disney’s sports streaming efforts were hindered by fragmented rights that made it nearly impossible to watch consequential games on its ESPN+ app, but the Mouse House finally upped its game in 2025. After acquiring NFL Network/RedZone, ESPN launched a brand new comprehensive streaming service in August that offered not only every Monday Night Football matchup across both ESPN and ABC this season but a ton of other streaming-exclusive games as well. The WWE also began offering premium live events on ESPN’s app as well. 2025 Lowlight: Although it wasn’t exclusively related to streaming, Disney’s decision to temporarily pull Jimmy Kimmel off the air while facing pressure from the Trump administration was a lowlight for democracy and may have had a negative effect on public perception of the company across the board. Campaigns circulated online encouraging Disney+ and Hulu subscribers to ditch their plans. Independent data reports have estimated millions of Americans canceled their subscriptions in that aftermath, though the economic fallout is hard to quantify. Disney is about to stop reporting streaming subscriber numbers in quarterly earnings reports, so the full impact of that backlash may not be known, since only a portion of those effects were documented in the company’s Q4 earnings. Regardless, it was yet another year of controversy for Disney. Challenge for 2026: Stay in consumers’ good graces. This year was as tumultuous as ever for Disney, and 2026 looks to present its own challenges as the company looks to dip its toes further into user-generated AI content. That ventures could go either way, as consumer sentiment specifically around AI is constantly shifting, but any rollout will surely spark backlash from the creative community. The one thing that is clear is that Disney could benefit from a little less turbulence with consumers in 2026, so it should proceed with caution. Biggest question for 2026: Disney isn’t the only company to tease AI-generated content might soon be available on its streaming platforms, but it certainly has the biggest IP to work from in that regard. After inking a blockbuster deal with OpenAI, how might Disney’s AI ambitions intersect with its streaming offerings in 2026? 2025 Highlight: Becoming the belle of the ball. While HBO Max had gradually earned a place among the top handful of services since its problematic launch in 2020, that uphill climb has gained a big tailwind with the acquisition interest by Netflix and Paramount. While either company taking over would mean more upheaval for a company that has cycled through three owners in a decade, for the streaming business the injection of resources will be dramatic – at least until Netflix merges it out of existence. 2025 Lowlight: The rebranding fiasco of Max going back to HBO Max. While senior execs gamely tried to own the mistake when revealing the revamp at the company’s upfront presentation last May, it still belongs in the corporate annals next to New Coke and Qwikster. Challenge for 2026: Now that it has finally made it to long-forbidden territories like the UK, Germany and Italy (which were unavailable due to a Sky output deal), what can HBO Max make of it? Netflix has become Netflix by incubating global hits from non-U.S. territories. HBO Max should lean into its prestige reputation and take a page from that playbook. Biggest question for 2026: Can movies throw around more weight? As solid a hit as Superman and other releases were in theaters during Warner Bros.’ best year in ages (not to mention Materialists and other A24 releases making their debuts on HBO Max), they made minimal waves in streaming. With Harry Potter set to rekindle interest in the film franchise with a series take due in 2027, the clout of movies could be HBO Max’s not-so-secret weapon. 2025 Highlight: K-pop Demon Hunters. The roaring success of Sony’s animated musical, which landed at the streaming giant under the companies’ pay-1 output deal, gave Netflix something it has been craving: a bona fide franchise. Riding a tide of pop-culture goodwill, a sing-along version of the movie raked in $19.2 million last fall, topping the weekend box office charts. The film also just recently surpassed 500M views on Netflix. 2025 Lowlight: Yet another video game course-correction. Co-CEO Greg Peters, who has overseen the games effort since it began in earnest in 2022, has not tried to put lipstick on a pig. But this year saw the latest strategic shift away from pricey franchise plays and toward casual games suited to the living room. Last fall, Peters made the news personally at an L.A. conference that an adaptation of the board game Boggle was joining the lineup. While the overall business had a banner year, that damp squib of an announcement seemed to sum up the entire gaming misadventure. Challenge for 2026: How can management keep the troops focused as they pursue Warner Bros.? At $82.7 billion, the deal would be exponentially larger than any prior M&A transaction in the company’s nearly three-decade history. The most important task for Peters, Ted Sarandos and other top execs is keeping the industry-leading operation humming. Biggest question for 2026: Will the movie portfolio undergo any more changes under film chairman Dan Lin? The producer and former Warner exec was installed in mid-2024, so his fingerprints may not yet be evident on a recent slate marked by Frankenstein, Electric State, A House of Dynamite, Jay Kelly, and Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Lin’s best-known credits include The Lego Movie, It, and other properties with profiles that stand out from Netflix’s recent output. 2025 Highlight: Taylor Sheridan, aka Paramount’s golden goose, kept filling the basket. New seasons of Landman, Tulsa King and Mayor of Kingstown clicked with viewers, as did MobLand, which wasn’t created by Sheridan but was exec produced by his close collaborator, David Glasser. Despite the upheaval of the merger with Skydance, which closed in August and entailed thousands of layoffs, the content kept flowing. 2025 Lowlight: Losing Taylor Sheridan. With more than three years left on his overall deal with Paramount, the Yellowstone creator announced he would segue to NBCUniversal in 2029. Of course, there is spin on both sides, especially with high-priced talent deals under a microscope across the industry. But the notion that newly minted CEO David Ellison spent time courting Sheridan and came up empty didn’t send the ideal signal to the troops. Challenge for 2026: Ordering off the menu. While Sheridan’s world, South Park, the UFC, CBS programming (including the NFL) and Paramount movies are continuing to be marquee draws for the streaming service, it needs to break new ground if it’s going to muscle its way into the top echelon. Should the WBD quest or other M&A deals bear fruit, they would be a quick route to scale. Regardless, Netflix alum Cindy Holland and her troops will need to come up with an equivalent to Orange is the New Black or the many other follow-ups to House of Cards she presided over in her old job. Those originals positioned Netflix as not just intriguing but essential. Biggest question for 2026: Will David Ellison’s long-promised tech overhaul of Paramount+, with or without the Warner Bros. Discovery assets, bear fruit in the new year? Since the media business set off on the expensive path of chasing Netflix nearly a decade ago, it has made a number of investments that were billed as pixie dust capable of transforming them into true tech giants. AI is the latest element said to confer such power. Technology is ever-present in the ecosystem, so the fact that it exists isn’t new. The main question facing Ellison & Co. is: How will they use it? 2025 Highlight: Love Island USA. Peacock had a lot riding on Season 7 after the reality show finally took off last year, and, boy, did it deliver. The season broke every viewership record it possibly could, becoming Peacock’s most-watched original season ever with 18B minutes viewed throughout the two months it aired this summer. For better or worse, the show was everywhere, and so were its contestants. Notable wins on the scripted front: The Paper and All Her Fault both performed quite well. The Office spinoff was renewed before the episodes even hit the streamer, and All Her Fault topped the Luminate weekly TV rankings in the week it premiered. It was the first time that a Peacock original series had been No. 1 since the Luminate rankings were introduced. 2025 Lowlight: Ads, ads, and more ads. Every major premium streaming platform, save for Apple, has introduced an ad-tier by this point. So, why does Peacock’s approach to ads feel particularly obnoxious? NBCUniversal recently touted “arrival ads,” which will bombard users with an ad as soon as they log onto the platform. The company also says it’ll use AI tools to scan live content and place ads at pivotal moments with which “advertiser’s ad or creative automatically aligns.” Think big moments, like when a team hits the 10-yard line – aka, the time when a viewer would arguably be most agitated by being confronted with an ad. (NBCU execs said at a press briefing this month that the spots will not interrupt the live action but will look to draft off them when a break comes.) Challenge for 2026: Peacock has certainly had its moments, but is it considered a must-have? Having canceleld Poker Face, Based on a True Story, and more this year, the streamer just doesn’t seem to be winning viewers over with its scripted content. The looming sale of WB to one of NBCUniversal’s rivals, Netflix or Paramount, would supercharge either of those studios’ content libraries and could potentially be spell bad news for Peacock, unless it can hold out until 2029 when Taylor Sheridan arrives. Biggest question for 2026: Can sports be its saving grace? A three-year rights deal with bring the MLB to NBC and Peacock in 2026, and the platform will also host the Winter Olympics in February. Peacock also just began streaming WNBA coverage in addition to its ongoing Premier League, NFL and NBA coverage. Oh, and since NBC is hosting the Super Bowl, Peacock will simulcast that as well. While the streamer has yet to make itself essential in the scripted content space, sports buffs would be hard pressed not to have it. 2025 Highlight: The twin home runs of The Summer I Turned Pretty and Thursday Night Football. The third and final season of Jenny Han’s young adult romance came roaring back to the streamer this summer with an audience unlike anything it had ever seen before. Per Prime Video, it amassed 70M viewers globally in 70 days. On the NFL front, Prime Video’s fourth season of TNF is up 13% over last year, marking a third straight season of double-digit growth. 2025 Lowlight: Amazon canceled a lot of series this year including Étoile, Butterfly, Countdown, Bosch: Legacy, Motorheads, The Wheel of Time, Cruel Intentions, and The Runarounds. Lots of arguments to be made as to why any or all of these series should or should not have been canceled, but it’s becoming pretty clear that frequent cancellations negatively impacts consumer sentiment. Challenge for 2026: Prime Video ended the year with the return of Fallout, and Season 2 of Mr & Mrs Smith is delayed indefinitely, leaving just a few heavy hitting scripted series to come in 2026. The Boys set to end next year with its fifth and final season, and Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power will also return (although, the latter’s second season struggled significantly compared to the first, so Season 3’s performance isn’t a sure bet, either). Given all the cancellations listed above, Prime Video may be hard pressed to make a mark with anything new in 2026. Titles to keep an eye on is the Legally Blonde prequel series, Elle, and the Michelle Yeoh-led Blade Runner 2099. Biggest question for 2026: Will Amazon finally become the one-stop content discovery hub? Analysts’ predictions indicate that the tech giant might eventually introduce a universal search experience that allows users to navigate directly to other external streaming services to watch content. The streamer already quietly introduced a “news hub” that aggregates content from across hundreds of news channels, signaling its desire to become the central online marketplace for not just goods, but entertainment, too.

Comment Name Email Website Δ There are too many major streamers now, okay. Peacock needs to go away, Comcast has failed. When HBO Max merges with either Netflix or Paramount+, that will leave an array of streamers that can survive just fine. If Apple wanted to be in the big leagues, they would need to produce the kind of schlock Netflix does. Bottom feeding “documentaries” about serial killers, frothy romcom fantasy, teen angst, supernatural horror. Prestige drama about rich white people behaving badly and head-scratching sci fi will only get you so far. I hope Apple doesn’t start slumming. We have enough of that. If no longer reporting subscriber numbers, Streamers still have to report the specific income from the service itself, no? Could you not do the math to at least estimate how many subscribers they are getting from that? For Paramount, is Star Trek no longer a factor? South Park is mentioned over this? I know that there has been some criticism of Star Trek shows, but it can’t be that bad. Are people that stupid they can’t keep up with streamer rebranding? Do they really care? It’s like saying people are confused by the difference between an apple you eat and the company that makes phones. Speaking of Apple, how many are getting Apple streaming for free by buying an Apple product? Do they offer free subscriptions when doing so? Here is a possibly odd question: What, if anything, does it cost a streamer to run and maintain the servers providing subscribers their content 24/7? We are now hearing about AI data centers resulting in consumers paying higher electric bills. Are not streaming “data centers” somewhat the same even if not as energy hungry? Is raising subscription prices partly due to running these centers? Is canceling, or even removing, content few, if anyone, is watching, a way to save money by recycling wasted space? Has anyone thought of this? You’d have to also estimate ARPU, which varies throughout the world. For Netflix, ARPU in Asia is about half that of North America. So if Netflix adds a lot of Asian subscribers but doesn’t report subscriber figures, regional breakdown or regional ARPU, then guestimating their figures becomes dicey. And then add in the ad-based tiers, which on the surface is less revenue but actually more when you add in the ad revenue. Ad tiers are generally more lucrative than ad-free ones, which is why the streamers push them. The kind of servers Netflix has, just to serve up video, are much less power intensive than AI servers. Platforms remove content in order not to pay licensing fees on that content. The server space is a small consideration. However, Disney’s move into user generated AI content suggests that AI type servers will become far more of a factor in the future. I expect user generated content to make inroads into all the platforms, except for Apple, because prestige content without big franchises doesn’t mesh with AI nearly as well as the opposite. Star Trek has been terrrrrrible under Paramount’s watch. Strange New Worlds is all right, mainly due to good casting, but becoming stale. Nepo needs to clean house and start over with a new team. In my dreams, he hires Tony Gilroy… Apple is very generous with the free subscriptions. This year I suddenly got three free months for having a Roku TV, which was not new either so I was confused but happy to take the freebie. Streamers raise prices to whatever the market will bear. They will stop only when it causes churn in excess of the benefit of the price hike. This is true of every other business too. Prices are not set by the cost of goods. If people will pay $100 for a product and it costs $99 to make, the price is $100. If people will pay $100 for a product and it costs $1 to make, the price is $100. These streamers might be able to keep viewers attention if they didn’t wait so long between seasons. For example stranger things now has full blown adults on the show when they started out as kids. My attention span moves on if I can’t go back to a show within a reasonable time span without having to refresh my memory. The biggest elephant in the room. Short attention spans, social media and YouTube…. Yup. When everything finally shakes out I dont expect to see more than three to five streamers left standing. Ultimately Peacock can’t survive on its own, and it’s possible Paramount can’t either. Perhaps something happens between those two after Netflix gobbles up Warner Bros. Or perhaps Apple, cautiously biding its time, steps in to acquire whatever legacy leftovers remain. netflix and hulu have always been profitable, though hulu’s margins have been declining since even before disney bought it. none of the other platforms are or have ever been profitable.

Title: ‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton predicts 2026 will see the technology get even better and gain the ability to ‘replace many other jobs’

Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said artificial intelligence technology will continue improving next year, enough to wipe out more human workers. During an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, he was asked for his 2026 predictions after declaring 2025 a pivotal year for AI. “I think we’re going to see AI get even better,” Hinton replied. “It’s already extremely good. We’re going to see it having the capabilities to replace many, many jobs. It’s already able to replace jobs in call centers, but it’s going to be able to replace many other jobs.” He added that AI’s progression is such that after every seven months or so, it is able to complete tasks that took twice as long as before. That means that on a coding project, for example, AI can do in minutes what used to take an hour. And in a few years, AI will be able to perform software engineering tasks that now need a month’s worth of labor. “And then there’ll be very few people need for software engineering projects,” predicted Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI.” Earlier in the interview, he was asked if he was more or less worried about AI since he left Google in 2023 and started warning about the technology’s dangers. “I’m probably more worried,” he answered. “It’s progressed even faster than I thought. In particular, it’s got better at doing things like reasoning and also at things like deceiving people.” If an AI believes someone is trying to prevent it from achieving its goals, it will try to deceive people in order to remain in existence and complete its tasks, he explained. To be sure, AI can also benefit humanity by helping researchers make breakthroughs in medicine, education and climate-related innovations. But Hinton said he’s not sure if the risks from AI outweigh the positives. “But along with those wonderful things comes some scary things, and I don’t think people are putting enough work into how we can mitigate those scary things,” he warned. Some AI companies are doing more than others in trying to ensure safety, but Hinton said there’s also a profit motive and tradeoffs that executives are weighing. “They may think there’s a lot of good to be done here, and just for a few lives we’re not going to not do that good,” he said. “For driverless cars, they will kill people, but they’ll kill far fewer people than ordinary drivers.” Hinton has been consistently sounding the alarm on AI, and in recent months has flagged its potential to put humans out of work. In October, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he told Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week. While some studies show AI is improving the productivity of existing workers rather than leading to mass layoffs, evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level. A recent analysis of job openings since OpenAI launched ChatGPT shows they plummeted roughly 30%. Companies like Amazon have announced layoffs while also acknowledging efficiency gains from using AI. And in September, Hinton said AI will create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits, attributing it to the capitalist system. “It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer,” he told the Financial Times

Title: Bitcoin drops 32% as ETF money exits – Yet THIS group isn’t backing off

Bitcoin ETFs record sell-off but hold firm on institutional support. Bitcoin has faced intense selling pressure, with the asset down 32% from its high of $126,000 on the 6th of October. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain a key channel for gauging Bitcoin market sentiment. This time, however, the behavior of investors behind these ETFs suggests deeper dynamics at play. U.S. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have remained on the bearish side of the market, recording significant outflows even as Bitcoin’s price attempts to stabilize. Bitcoin [BTC] Spot ETFs are facing renewed pressure as traditional investors pull back capital while still maintaining exposure to the asset. According to CryptoQuant, Cumulative Outflows from Bitcoin ETFs have reached $5.5 billion from their all-time high. As a result, total Assets Under Management (AUM) have dropped to $116.58 billion, down from a peak of $163.27 billion. Source: CoinGlass This trend confirms that traditional investors, operating through institutional ETFs, have scaled back capital inflows into the market. Such outflows are expected during periods of weak market sentiment, especially as Bitcoin continues to range between $85,000 and $90,000. Despite broader ETF outflows, traditional investors with exposure to BlackRock’s U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF continue to dominate market activity. Over the past twelve days, these investors have purchased more BTC than any other institutional group in the market. Data showed that within this period, the group recorded six separate BTC ETF inflows, with total net inflows amounting to 1.32 million Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.16 billion. This trend remains a key indicator, particularly as BlackRock controls the largest share of BTC among institutional investors. Source: CryptoQuant As of press time, this group held $67.56 billion worth of Bitcoin, reinforcing a bullish undercurrent that continues to influence other ETF participants in the market. Notably, retail investors trading Bitcoin directly through centralized exchanges are also showing signs of renewed confidence. Since the start of December, this group has consistently accumulated BTC week after week. Last week alone, purchases totaled approximately $891.61 billion, according to Glassnode. While this reflects broader global retail investor behavior, it confirms sustained confidence in the asset class, marked by four consecutive weeks of consistent supply absorption. BlackRock may still expand its involvement with Bitcoin, as CEO Larry Fink has publicly shifted his stance on the cryptocurrency. Fink, who previously described Bitcoin as an “index for money laundering” and a tool for “thieves,” had a change in perspective during a recent interview at the DealBook Summit 2025. He noted that BTC now presents a “huge future use case,” signaling growing institutional openness. While the scope of these use cases remains unclear, the shift highlights a potential long-term opportunity for current investors.

Although asset managers had previously fought tooth and nail to offer products tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s spot price, many foresaw opportunities in 2025, as the regulatory environment started to shift with President Donald Trump’s return to power in January. As of Dec. 15, spot Bitcoin ETFs had generated $57.7 billion in net inflows since their historic debut in January 2024, according to Farside Investors. That represented a 59% increase compared to $36.2 billion at the start of this year. But inflows weren’t consistent. Investors poured $1.2 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs on Oct. 6, for example, as the asset approached an all-time high above $126,000, according to CoinGlass. As Bitcoin’s price slipped below the $90,000 mark on Nov. 11, a few weeks later, investors yanked $900 million from the funds. Still, that was only the second worst day for spot Bitcoin ETFs on record: As Bitcoin plunged in February on fears related to trade and inflation, the products posted $1 billion in outflows. Since their debut last July, spot Ethereum ETFs had generated $12.6 billion in net inflows, as of Dec. 15, according to CoinGlass. As the cryptocurrency surged toward an all-time high of nearly $4,950 in August, the products generated $1 billion in inflows on a single day. With signs of growing adoption among financial institutions, those products largely operated in the background, as onlookers focused on the prospect of more ETFs that could potentially boost digital asset prices, or expand access to new investors. Yet some are relatively focused on ETFs tracking multiple cryptocurrencies at once, as products ideal for institutions. When the SEC approved generic listing standards for commodity-based trusts in September, the regulator moved to address anticipation that had been building for months. The stack of applications for ETFs covering a wide range of digital assets had grown thick on its desk, with approvals hinging on an answer that the SEC’s previous leadership had danced around for years: When should a digital asset be treated a commodity? Instead of being forced to make case-by-case decisions about the eligibility of various cryptocurrencies, from Dogecoin to the president’s meme coin, the SEC instead outlined criteria for exchanges that made digital assets fit for commodity-based trusts. Among the most important factors, the standards require digital assets underlying ETFs to trade on surveilled markets, have a six-month history of futures trading, or already back an exchange-traded fund with significant exposure. That meant that at least a dozen cryptocurrencies were instantly “good to go,” Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt in September. From his perspective, he described the move as expected. The approval of generic listing standards is set to greatly expand the number of products that investors have access to, but asset managers are still waiting for answers on at least 126 ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Research Analyst James Seyffart recently said on X. Those applications focus on tokens from up-and-coming decentralized finance projects like the Hyperliquid, as well as relatively novel meme coins, including Mog. First there was Bitcoin, then there was Ethereum. Now, investors in the U.S. have access to ETFs tracking the spot price of XRP and Solana, among a handful of others. As the fifth- and seventh-largest digital assets by market capitalization, respectively, XRP and Solana both faced regulatory headwinds under the Biden administration, which dissipated on the road to becoming underlying assets for a number of products. Last year’s debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs unleashed a wave of demand that buoyed the asset’s price to new highs. While the same can’t be said for the smaller cryptocurrencies yet, products dedicated purely to XRP and Solana still generated notable activity. “I don’t think they’ve had the effect on the price that maybe people hoped for, but I do think, idiosyncratically, they have been huge successes and a validation of investor appetite beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. Leon said the debut of ETFs for Solana and XRP came in November at a “disadvantageous time,” with macroeconomic conditions driving digital-asset prices lower in recent months. Still, spot Solana ETFs have generated $92 million in net inflows since launch, as of Dec. 15, according to CoinGlass. Spot XRP ETFs, which debuted the same month, have generated roughly $883 million in net inflows since they began trading. The debut of Solana ETFs was notable for another reason: They were among the first ETFs to share a portion of their rewards from staking with investors, a development bolstered by new guidance last month from the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was among financial giants that have thus far passed up the opportunity to expand their set of crypto-focused products to additional assets, but Leon noted that XRP and Solana’s communities may not need them. “What we’ve seen with the ETF so far shows that these communities are much more engaged and stronger and larger than maybe many people thought,” he said. “And I think that bodes well for both ecosystems going into 2026.” Net inflows for spot Dogecoin ETFs stood at $2 million as of Dec. 15, according to SoSoValue. In 2025, individual investors and hedge funds were among the most likely groups to hold spot crypto ETFs, but that dynamic may start shifting materially soon, according to Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management. He told Decrypt that many advisors and professional investors are still in the process of due diligence for ETFs that track cryptocurrencies, but he has a sense that they could start thinking seriously about allocations to the asset class soon. Then again, Vanguard signaled earlier this month that it would let its 50 million customers trade some spot crypto ETFs on its brokerage platform. Bank of America, meanwhile, put its stamp of approval on modest crypto allocations for private wealth clients starting next year. “A year ago or so, there was a lot of regulatory uncertainty, and they weren't really ready to dip their toes into the space” he said. “And now the questions aren’t really whether or not they should get exposure. It's how they should get exposure.” In that sense, O’Shea believes ETFs that track an index of digital assets will become a bigger part of the conversation next year. Many professional investors appreciate how those funds’ holdings shift over time, giving them relative peace of mind, he said. “They can make an allocation to an index ETF and get broad exposure to the growth potential of the market without having to have all that sort of detailed knowledge,” O’Shea explained. “They don't need to know everything about every one of these individual assets.” In February, Hashdex was behind the first spot ETF tracking multiple digital assets in the U.S., with the debut of the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF. Modeled on the Nasdaq Crypto Index, it holds Cardano, Chainlink, and Stellar, as well as larger cryptocurrencies. Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, and CoinShares have debuted similar products, although some seek exposure to digital assets through derivatives. In total, the group of index ETFs offer exposure to 19 digital assets, per ETF Trends. Although some pension funds in the U.S. have purchased spot Bitcoin ETFs, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board liquidated $300 million in holdings around February. The move was revealed via 13F filings that large institutional investors release quarterly. Al Warda Investments disclosed a $500 million position in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF in November. The investment firm is tied to the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, a subsidiary of Mubadala Investment, which acts as a sovereign wealth fund in Abu Dhabi. Mubadala itself disclosed a position in BlackRock’s product in February, which was worth $567 million, as of its latest 13F filing. Around the same time, it was revealed that Harvard’s endowment held shares in the ETF worth $433 million. Brown University and Emory University also disclosed positions in spot Bitcoin ETFs this year, emerging as early adopters of the asset on an institutional level. Broadly, analysts have said the shift in investors could lead to less volatility for Bitcoin and shallower drawdowns. “It hasn't been dramatic, but it has been notable,” O’Shea said, in reference to a broadening investment base. “This shift from retail to institutional is very good for the long-term sustainability of the asset class, because you do have these folks with much longer-term time horizons.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Worried About Retirement? You're Not Alone: Nearly 50% of Americans in Peak Earning Years Worry About It Every Day

For many Americans, retirement is a constant worry. According to BlackRock, 47% of Americans between the ages of 45 to 54 worry about their retirement savings at least once a day. These financial moves will help to assuage some of those worries. "It’s common for Gen Xers to feel squeezed between saving for retirement and living a meaningful life now. The good news is that they are achieving peak incomes," said Preston Cherry, CFP and founder of Concurrent Wealth. Here's how Gen Xers can move into greater retirement savings and less worry. When it comes to retirement savings, young investors have an advantage because the money they invest has the advantage of growing with compound interest over several decades. Assuming average stock market returns of 6% to 7%, every dollar you invest now can triple or quadruple by the time you retire. People in their 40s and 50s have shorter time horizons, but investing 10 to 20 years out from retirement can still make a difference in their retirement savings. If you aren't already doing so, automate your retirement savings strategy. Put aside money with each paycheck or each month, even if it's only a small amount. These steady payments can help your retirement savings grow, and they can also help to calm some of the panic you may be feeling about retirement. You should also establish an emergency fund. Put three to six months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account, and only reach for it in times of an emergency. This will reduce the temptation to tap your retirement funds for surprise expenses, which can potentially incur hefty penalties. A 401(k) or similar tax-advantaged plan is a great way to build up your retirement savings, especially if it comes with a matching contribution from your employer. As a rule of thumb, investing 10% to 15% of each paycheck is a good goal. In 2025, you can contribute as much as $23,500 in a 401(k). This amount goes up to $70,000 when your contributions are combined with your employer's contributions. If you are in your 50s, you may invest in a catch-up contribution of $7,500 into your 401(k). Individual retirement accounts—like a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA—are other great ways to save for retirement. Both have contribution limits of $7,000 for 2025. Those age 50 older can make a catch-up contribution of $1,000. Cherry encourages Gen Xers to align their financial plans with their values, lifestyle needs, and long-term goals. "This is what I call lifestyle-aligned wealth planning. It’s not just about how much you save, but how intentionally you save," Cherry advises. "When you know your retirement rate—which is how much you need to fund [your retirement] annually—your retirement date, when you want to be work-optional, you’re no longer guessing. You’re designing your life with clarity and confidence." To get started, you'll need to be honest with yourself about the state of your retirement savings and where you would like to be headed. "The keys are being honest, giving yourself grace for where you are, being confident, and committing to where you want to go," Cherry said. For most people, the years between ages 45 and 54 are peak years for income, but many still worry about being able to afford retirement. The best way to beat these worries is through action. Start saving regularly, and contribute as much as you can to tax-advantaged retirement plans, like 401(k)s and IRA accounts. Taking charge of your investments and savings is the best way to ease your concerns about retirement.

Title: Several factors affecting success for job hunters in Lehigh Valley

Time Published: 2025-12-28T12:07:28Z

Sherri Skok wants to work full time. But she is having trouble finding a company that wants her. The 61-year-old Easton resident has a resume with plenty of experience as a personal assistant/chief of staff in corporate offices, including two decades at Barnes & Noble. Apparently, it’s not enough — or it may be too much — for a long list of Lehigh Valley businesses that have advertised openings. Skok has kept a list of them; places where she’s interviewed and was subsequently rejected. Some of them couldn’t be bothered even to send a reply after they talked, which is referred to as “ghosting.” Many others simply didn’t reply to the application, which these days are mostly filled out online. Skok, who has found part-time employment since talking to The Morning Call in early November, said she probably filled out more than a thousand applications, including about 50 since moving to the Lehigh Valley this year. She says she’s received at least one interview for about a quarter of them. “I apply for jobs, and maybe I’m not 100% qualified for or even interested in, just to see where it might lead,” said Skok, who grew up in Macungie and graduated from Emmaus High School and Penn State. “I’ve been aggressive about it. I sometimes spend eight hours a day doing it. I think there has to be an angle [on a job] I’m not considering or maybe I should go about it this way, or let me reach out. There are many, many ways. But it didn’t yield anything.” Her story isn’t unique. Social media has plenty of anecdotes from hard-luck job candidates who have applied to hundreds of them without a bite. Some economists have referred to it as a “jobless boom,” a period of economic growth and high corporate profits that coincides with weak job creation and even layoffs. Michael Rivera, assistant professor of business information systems at Lehigh University, confirmed that Skok has plenty of company. “I think it’s somewhat universal,” he said. Uncertainty about the economy and politics have made some employers reluctant to add workers. “I have spoken to many companies that have funds [to hire, but] that are just hesitant,” Rivera said. “They’re not quite sure where things are going to net out, and it has impacted where they’re looking to make investments.” Additional headwinds for people on the job search are a wave of recent layoffs nationwide with 150,000 workers losing their jobs in October, according to the Associated Press. The cuts are coming from business giants such as Amazon, Procter & Gamble, Target and UPS that are not only dealing with uncertainty over tariffs, but are also looking at ways to implement artificial intelligence in their operations. “We’re reading about strong layoffs proposed for companies that are happening,” Rivera said. “Most recently, I read an article on Walmart’s CEO that says get ready, every single job is going to change and it’s going to have AI in it. Walmart’s plan is for more revenue without increasing its workforce.” The federal government didn’t release labor statistics during the shutdown, but payroll processor ADP reported private sector companies shed 32,000 jobs in November. According to Workforce Board Lehigh Valley, the region’s unemployment rate was at 4.9%, as of September — the most recent statistics available — with job postings up over the year by 18.9% at 15,700. Nationally, the Labor Department reported that the hiring rate fell to 3.2% in October, matching the lowest figure since March 2013, not counting the pandemic. After several years at Barnes & Noble — where Skok said she earned “six figures” — she was terminated in 2019 after the company was sold. “At the end of the day, loyalty doesn’t mean anything because when the company got sold, they eliminated my department just like that,” Skok said. Skok had a complicated job search process that wasn’t helped by the COVID pandemic, which put some promising roles on hold. She did find a chief of staff position with a fitness influencer, but left after questions of financial problems. After that was a year with a small equity firm, but she was let go after a major investor dropped out. To keep her finances on track, Skok sold her home in northern New Jersey “to put money in the bank” and took up residence in Easton to continue the job search. Skok said she’s applied to a “who’s who” of local companies and nonprofits since she moved back to the Lehigh Valley. “Some were flat-out rejections,” she said. “At some point, I got an interview and it seemed to go well, and then I’m either ghosted or If I inquire, I’ll find out that the position is no longer available.” One that stood out for Skok was an interview for a manager’s position at a local bookstore that paid between $11 and $19 an hour. Two months later, the position still was not filled, highlighting her frustration with even finding a lower-wage position. Cathy Rychalsky, who recently took over as executive director at Workforce Board Lehigh Valley, said there is a lot of frustration among job seekers, many of whom never hear back about their applications. She also said some employers are overwhelmed by the number of applications because many are people who apply to jobs not within their skillset to satisfy unemployment requirements. They simply don’t have the staff to review every application and are forced to use things as AI for screening purposes. Another factor is changes in the labor market since the pandemic as employers can be pickier with the applicant pool. “The pendulum has shifted post-pandemic,” Rychalski said. “During the pandemic, people were able to write their job description and how much they wanted to get paid. Today it doesn’t look like that, and it shifted fairly quickly. It has shifted back where the employer is really driving the car.” What to do? Rivera said that even during the search, job seekers should take command of their growth and development. “That is something that is within their span of control. They can guide that,” he said. “They need to be taking an active approach. If they’re taking a passive one, they really run the risk of having other employees outgrow them.” Rivera said earning another college degree isn’t necessary, but he recommended such things as reading, watching videos and attending seminars to improve skills. Writing a resume for the future, which includes skills and competencies you want to have in three to five years, can be a guide. Old strategies, such as networking and making human connections, are still very effective. It’s OK to use AI in the job search to tailor resumes and cover letters to align them with the job description’s keywords, he said. With companies adopting AI, it’s important to show how job seekers are integrating those tools into their skillsets. “I’ve found that the No. 1 thing that companies are looking for today is adaptability,” Rivera said. “At the moment an employee is hired, they need to be growing with market and industry trends, with their corporate culture, always looking to kind of extend their abilities further and further with new tools and new approaches.” Rychalsky suggested using services such as Pennsylvania CareerLink. She said it’s helpful to talk to someone about the ups and downs of the job hunt. “Having someone who’s on the lookout for you, who is connected to the business community, who can maybe even reach out on your behalf and ask if this person did apply, could they reconsider them?” Rychalsky said. “If we don’t have a connection with that business, we might be able to make that connection. That’s what CareerLink is here to do. It’s here to help the job seekers, and is here to help the business community.” Meanwhile, Skok will continue her search for a full-time position that includes benefits. “It’s not like a one-person flight. There are many, many people in the United States who are facing this right now,” she said. “And they’re good qualified candidates. I just don’t understand how the job market became so overly competitive. I asked myself, do these jobs even exist? Is it a way to take your information? Who knows?” Morning Call reporter Evan Jones can be reached at ejones@mcall.com. “Some were flat-out rejections,” she said. “At some point, I got an interview and it seemed to go well, and then I’m either ghosted or If I inquire, I’ll find out that the position is no longer available.” One that stood out for Skok was an interview for a manager’s position at a local bookstore that paid between $11 and $19 an hour.

Title: Should we ban social media for under-16s? Irish teens share their thoughts

Earlier this month Australia became the first country in the world to ban social media for children under the age of 16. It’s a move that’s being watched closely around the globe, not least by those aged under 16, wondering if this could become their reality too. Here, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said “there needs to be more debate on whether blanket bans are the way to go”, while Tánaiste Simon Harris said he is “very supportive of the idea of social media being restricted to people above a certain age”. But what do those likely to be affected if a similar ban was to happen in Ireland think? Sarah Davitt (15), from Blackrock, Co Dublin, recently returned from a trip to Brussels with the Webwise Youth Panel, which is focused on raising awareness of online safety. “I personally would be against it [the ban] being brought in to Ireland,” she says. “By banning something outright, less education is going to be put forward. If we’re trying to educate our youth on social media, we cannot do that unless we have the use of social media.” She says “restrictions and safety by design” are more appropriate. If a ban was to happen, however, she feels it should be geared towards 12- and 13-year-olds. She believes a ban will make social media “more attractive”. “Strict parents create sneaky children ... If you bring in the ban you’ll really see that being played out. “I don’t think people realise how easy it is to work a VPN,” Sarah says, referring to a virtual private network. “Changing the country’s location is so phenomenally easy ... I’ve seen my friends do it when their parents are really strict on social media ... Most people my age, even if they’re allowed or not allowed social media by their parents, have accounts.” She says there needs to be more education and “digital media literacy”. Strict parents create sneaky children ... If you bring in the ban you’ll really see that being played out “If we bring in this ban we’re just going to presume kids aren’t on social media, because they shouldn’t be there, which then just creates a worse social media space ... Without having social media companies held accountable for keeping online safe for kids, it’s not going to be created safe for anyone else.” She points also to the opportunities social media creates for people who are part of minority groups to connect. “Most people have seen harmful videos on the internet. I think most of my friends and I saw the video of when Charlie Kirk was shot ... Obviously the trad wife trend, that has been very prevalent on social media recently. I understand that the Government is trying to help us and trying to protect us. And I do agree that something has to be done, and done soon ... banning it at 16 is just not the solution.” Zach Moore (14), from Greenhills, Dublin, uses WhatsApp, Snapchat and YouTube mostly. Social media is important to him. He too is part of the Webwise Youth Panel. That Andrew Tate fella. I remember getting a load of his videos at one point for a while, and then they just stopped “If I’m bored, I’d probably go on social media. If I needed to know something, I’d look it up. And I talk to my friends as well,” Zach says. If he comes across misogynistic, racist or other unacceptable content he says he ignores it or reports it. “That Andrew Tate fella. I remember getting a load of his videos at one point for a while, and then they just stopped. He seems like a bit of an extremist,” Zach says. He can see how this material can target boys. “I can definitely why they’d want to ban it, but to be honest I don’t think a complete ban would solve anything ... I think they would have been better to have mandatory parental controls. Leave it up to the parents.” Zach worries he spends too much time on social media sometimes. But he thinks if a ban was introduced in Ireland young people might spend more time trying to get around the ban rather than doing other things. He thinks some adults understand how important social media is to young people. “But some think that it’s all bad,” he says. “I don’t think that it’s all bad, but there definitely are certain areas that are malicious, or there’s no good intent.” [ Could Ireland follow Australia and ban under-16s from social media?Opens in new window ] He’d like to see “stricter moderation on platforms” and more education and support provided to teenagers on how to navigate problematic content that they might come across. He thinks the youth voice is important. “It’s definitely good to hear from people who are going to be directly affected, or people who are at risk of coming under the ban.” He expects adults and younger people may hold polar opposite views. Zach doesn’t think adults necessarily know best on this. “Especially with social media because it’s only really gained this much traction over the past 15 years.” Eve Cullen, from Tipperary, is 15. She uses TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat. I go online and I’m able to find thousands of other people who also enjoy that hobby and I can talk to them about it She feels “in theory it’s a good idea to stop letting kids use social media” but argues that a cut-off age of 16 is too high. “Eleven or 12 would be perfect.” At 15, she says, “a lot of our lives revolve around social media and it’s important to have”. She believes people will easily find a way around any ban. “I feel like a lot of the people who brought in this ban might not have kids themselves. Parents might know more about how kids are going to get around it.” Many young people find their “community” online, Eve says. She uses Snapchat to call and text people she already knows. “It’s great to meet new people on TikTok.” Eve says most young people have their wits about them when it comes to the danger of being contacted by strangers who may not be who they claim to be. “I don’t think it’s as big a problem as a lot of people make it out to be.” Eve has seen some upsetting content online. “I figure a way to go around it and ignore it. It’s not a huge thing online for me.” She insists she’s not hugely influenced by political, health or wellness content she sees online, saying she’s more likely to try out a recipe. She believes there are lots of positives to social media. “I love doing knitting and crochet and stuff like that. And there’s not many people in Thurles, where I live, that would be into that as well. I go online and I’m able to find thousands of other people who also enjoy that hobby and I can talk to them about it. But if social media was banned then I’d be very lonely in that hobby.” At school, Eve uses Instagram for her transition year (TY) mini-company. “Everyone in TY in our school [uses Instagram] to promote and advertise our products,” she explains. Her social media “used to be controlled when I was younger. There was an app on my phone that would block screen time,” Eve explains. But she feels at this age she is able to “self-police”. She worries that if teenagers weren’t granted access to social media until the age of 16, they wouldn’t know what things they “should look out for. They might get scammed, even, because they’ve never been exposed to it,” she says. Holly Heneghan (16) lives in Westmeath. She says she would hate a ban. “With Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok, the main three for me, it’s entertainment. Snapchat is for communicating with my friends ... I call and text on Snapchat.” She has seen things on social media that she doesn’t feel are appropriate for 12- and 13-year-olds to see, but feels things have improved. “There is still a lot of body positive stuff on social media now. [More] than there was when I was 12.” She has come across problematic material but “not necessarily in the apps that have been banned”. Inappropriate material can show up in advertisements that crop up in games, she explains. “There are times I’ve spent too much time on social media,” Holly admits, “but I go on social media because it shows me things I’m interested in. It gives me a break from the world because it shows sides that I like.” She doesn’t believe teens will accept the ban. “I think they’ll try and figure out a way to keep their social media.” Holly thinks a ban would make those under 16 more secretive about their social media use. She feels adults don’t necessarily understand the huge support social media can offer, including academically. “On TikTok there is a Stem site. It can teach you maths, science and engineering.” She believes the positives of social media outweigh the negatives. [Social media] gives me a break from the world because it shows sides that I like Hannah Goff (16) from Dublin, thinks a social media ban “is a really good idea” for younger people, but feels 14 or 15 may be a more appropriate cut-off age. “I don’t think people under 16 actually need phones to function.” She thinks younger teens could organise meet-ups through parents. “I think it might be easier as well for parents to understand where their child is and what their child might be doing.” She feels not having a phone could lead to under-16s meeting up with their friends in person more frequently. “However, I do think in Ireland there’s a lack of things to do for people under 16.” Hannah has learned a lot about content awareness in school. “If you know how to use social media, you’re better off with it, but I think people a lot of the time were just handing their kids phones ... and then they’re not really prepared for what they come across. [ A grand social media experiment begins in Australia. Will it work?Opens in new window ] “During the elections in the US I did see a lot of propaganda for Trump and Kamala. But I would just scroll past that. I don’t think I’ve seen anything that has been particularly disturbing or upsetting. But also I’ve been very careful to avoid that.” “You do see a lot of people online who are very different to how they normally look. They’re edited.” She feels younger people could be vulnerable to this. “I’ve seen a lot of eight- to 10-year-olds now who are using all the internet make-up”. Hannah believes the under-16s “will definitely” try to get around any ban “considering when the Yondr pouch was brought in. Everyone’s gotten around it at this point. “Teenagers, you tell them something to do and they will do the opposite. You give them a barrier and they’re going to go under it, over it, through it,” she says. Dr Colman Noctor, child and adolescent psychotherapist, says delaying access until a young person is mature enough “is the right thing to do”. But, he adds, “the how you do that is more complex”. He feels the Australian strategy, “while well intended, may not work”. “Imposing bans will always meet resistance and so some form of alliance with young people is far more likely to be successful. However, the difficulty is that young people think adults don’t have a clue about social media, and adults don’t think young people have a clue about real life. And both are probably true, but meeting a consensus will take time. “While I’m not sure the ban is the answer, waiting around for another 15 years to gain consensus is not a workable solution either,” Noctor says. “The damage of social media is happening now. “For me the only way this will be resolved is if the social media companies take the lead and invest in meaningfully protecting children, but that does not fit with their financial models so we have to do what we can in the meantime.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: John Collison’s bats to D6 topping the property charts: 2025 in quotes and numbers

“My remit was always to lend. During the difficult period, it was like shooting fish in a barrel because not everybody was lending at the time and there was a really great opportunity. There were still really good businesses that needed to borrow.” Avant Money chief executive Niall Corbett as he pressed ahead with plans to turn the nonbank lender into a full Irish bank branch of its Spanish parent Bankinter. “Fashion made statements then. Now, it is just dictated by a couple of brands mostly in Italy and France and we follow on their coat tails, so it is an uneven field – to get recognised you either have to be 18 or a millionaire. Being a boring middle-class father of seven is not the most exciting prospect, which I am happy with, but maybe pride drives me on.” The late Irish fashion designer Paul Costelloe, in an interview with The Irish Times in January, recalls Katherine Hamnett’s famous anti-nuclear T-shirt worn to 10 Downing Street to meet Margaret Thatcher. “We worked out that there could be between five and seven different agencies involved in a data centre. You get over one hurdle, you have to deal with another. You get over this hurdle, you have to go to the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]. You go to EPA, you can’t get a gas connection. That makes it difficult when you have other advanced jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, which has a department of digital infrastructure, or the UK, who are going to treat data as critical infrastructure.” In February, Garry Connolly of industry lobby group Digital Infrastructure Ireland said negativity here around data centres has resulted in multinationals bypassing the State for investment. “When you’re young you’ve nothing to lose. Ignorance is a great thing.” Padraic Rhatigan, who opened the Radisson Red hotel on the outskirts of Galway as one part of a major residential and commercial development, reflected in February on taking over the family business while still in his teens. “Thanks, guys.” Tesla chief executive Elon Musk to shareholders after they voted to approve his $1 trillion (€856 billion) compensation plan in November, awarding the world’s richest person what would be the largest corporate payout in history if he meets the goals necessary to receive it. “Two hundred and twenty eight homes were blocked in Killarney because they would interrupt the commute of a roost of horseshoe bats. Who signed up for this?” In October, Stripe cofounder John Collison looked at how the State can get out of the government-by-agency corner into which it has painted itself. “Within 15 to 25 years, I think it will be mandated that there will be autonomous vehicles. People will not be allowed to drive anything. Public transport systems in the future will become much more efficient. Buses will know what and where the demand is and will organise themselves accordingly.” Also in October, businessman Dermot Desmond called on the Government to scrap the long-awaited MetroLink project and instead plan for wide-scale autonomously-driven bus services. “Looking back, juggling these jobs and being a single parent with teenage kids, I genuinely don’t know how I did it. But I wanted to do it – to be a role model to my girls. Equally, having left school with only a few O-levels, I wanted to add something else to my CV.” BMW Ireland boss Helen Westby in February on working her way through various roles in BMW, looking after her daughters, and completing an MBA. “It’s almost becoming a sort of a two-tier [health service] where you hear clinicians and oncologists certainly talking about it, that they can prescribe a certain medicine to these patients, but the other patients can’t have it.” In an interview with The Irish Times, Samantha Humphreys, who leads pharma group MSD’s Irish business, spoke on how private health insurers have taken to approving payment for certain drugs that have been approved by the European Medicines Agency but are still working their way through the Irish system. “They’re going to hire some pudding whose particular talent will be not upsetting Fingal County Council or the morons in the Department of Transport.” Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary last month expressed faux confidence in airport operator DAA’s recruitment processes after a rift emerged between the board of the State company and its chief executive Kenny Jacobs. At the time of O’Leary’s quote, the two sides had agreed a settlement that would have seen Jacobs leave the business. “I guess a potential Fed chair is here too. I don’t know. Are we allowed to say that? Potential? He’s a respected person – that I can tell you. Thank you, Kevin.” US president Donald Trump keeps nobody guessing as to who he intends to appoint chairman of the Federal Reserve early next year as he introduces top White House economic official Kevin Hassett at an event. “It would be wrong not to confront the fact that we absolutely need gas for this transition. The overseas investors on which our economy depends will move in two or three years without reassurance that energy supplies here are secure.” Bord Gáis Energy chief executive Dave Kirwan last month made the argument that gas remains vital to the State, arguing that it will play a central role in aiding us to end fossil-fuel dependence. “We all know it’s only going one way, the demographics are going to double for over-65s in the next 10 years, over-85s as well. So, there’s a huge demand presently not to think about the future.” [ Bord Gáis Energy’s Dave Kirwan on Irish energy prices and the case for nuclear powerOpens in new window ] In April, Shane Jennings, the former rugby player and now chief executive of Dovida, Ireland’s largest homecare group, gave his take on the State’s preparations for dealing with an ageing population. “He was a nice fellah. He would go to the local pub for a pint in the evening and play some pool with the lads. I got to play a game with him in Fitzgerald’s of Avoca. He was good.” In October, Tesco Ireland boss Geoff Byrne recounted losing a game of pool to actor Colin Farrell while he was shooting the Ballykissangel drama series in Co Wicklow. “I had lunch with 14 European CEOs [at Davos] and the pessimism, you could cut it with a knife. It was so palpable – and it just was so obvious to me that the pessimism was overdone. But the pessimism was loud enough that I think finally the Europeans were waking up and saying, ‘we got to change’.” In April, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said European leaders should lighten up about the outlook for the continent despite a decade and a half of low growth and a perception that business is being over-regulated. [ King of Wall Street says European leaders ‘starting to focus on a growth agenda, not a control agenda’Opens in new window ] “It was hugely special. It couldn’t get any more special than under the lights in Croke Park. It was the first round of the league against the Dubs. To beat them and get front page of many newspapers ... it couldn’t have started any better. It was downhill after that. We didn’t do a whole lot of winning.” Ciaran Marron of Monaghan-based Activ8 Solar Energies spoke in May about the rough and tumble of business after the Monaghan senior football team walked out on to the pitch at Croke Park to play All Ireland champions Dublin wearing jerseys emblazoned with the Activ8 logo. “It’s the most popular Bill ever signed in the history of the country. What we’ve done is put everything into one Bill. We’ve never had anything like that before.” US president Donald Trump in July speaking to the media as his “big, beautiful Bill”, a sweeping spending package, is signed into law during a picnic at the White House. “I was in the wrong place at the wrong time in the family. The older kids were at university and the younger ones were behind me in school. I spent years dealing with the bank trying to pay down debt and get rid of things.” In the summer, serial dealmaker Cathal Friel, the seventh of 10 children, spoke about having to leave school at 16 to run indebted businesses when his father became ill. It left him with a lifelong aversion to debt and property investment. “The importance and benefit of international co-operation has been a key theme of my public life. I will soon be taking up the role of managing director and chief knowledge officer of the World Bank Group, based in Washington DC. I am therefore departing from public life in Ireland.” Then minister for finance Paschal Donohoe resigned his Dáil seat and left ministerial office to take up a role at the World Bank. “They stopped pretending. The mask is off. You’re getting fired if you speak out. Back in the day, [tech employees] used to be even asking questions [of their employer] in the comments on company chat boards.” In June, William Fitzgerald, the Waterford-born founder of The Worker Agency, spoke about the slavishness of tech barons to the Trump administration despite Silicon Valley’s previous outwardly liberal gloss. “I grew up on checkouts from a young age and it’s in my DNA. I grew up in that environment and it teaches you so much about efficiencies, waste and getting value for the customer. I was on the checkout from nine or 10 years of age right up to leaving university.” In September, Robert Ryan, the chief executive of Lidl’s Irish business, explained how he got a taste from retail from an early age while working in the family shop. The median price paid for a home in Dublin 6 in the third quarter, making it the most expensive Eircode in the State, according to property firm Geowox. The district, which includes Rathmines, Ranelagh and Rathgar, recorded the highest median sales price in the State, up 23 per cent year-on-year. The State’s jobless rate in July, hitting that mark for the first time since January 2022, according to revised figures from the Central Statistics Office. The amount paid by Scandinavian property companies Pandox and Eiendomsspar as they agreed to buy Ireland’s largest hotel group Dalata. Dalata, which operates 56 hotels under the four-star Maldron and Clayton brands, mainly in Ireland and Britain, had rejected an initial bid from Pandox and Eiendomsspar in early June that had valued the hotel operator at €1.3 billion. The proposed severance deal for airport operator DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs that was taken off the table after Minister for Transport Darragh O’Brien blocked the payment, raising yet more questions about the months-long standoff at the top of the airports group. [ Severance deal of near €1m for DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs off the tableOpens in new window ] O’Brien in November refused to approve the €960,000 payment to Mr Jacobs, which was agreed in September after mediation between the chief executive and the DAA board in talks chaired by industrial relations troubleshooter Kieran Mulvey. The cap on any future tariffs on pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports imposed by the United States on the European Union. The deal struck by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen with Trump saw European countries head off the US president’s threats of cripplingly high import taxes on products sold across the Atlantic. The number of weeks a bitter High Court civil trial involving three shareholders of tech conference giant Web Summit had been scheduled to last before it was struck out. The case was resolved after talks between the parties concluded with founder Paddy Cosgrave saying he was “delighted” two of his former friends would leave the company. Majority shareholder Cosgrave was suing David Kelly, who owned 12 per cent of the business, for alleged breaches of his fiduciary duties as a director of the company. Mr Cosgrave was, in turn, being sued by Kelly and another shareholder, Daire Hickey, who holds 7 per cent of the shares in Web Summit, for both alleged shareholder oppression and alleged breaches of a profit-sharing agreement. The salary advertised by the Government for its new housing tsar who will be charged with managing the crisis and increasing supply. The role was plunged into controversy when the expected appointee, Brendan McDonagh, the chief executive of the National Asset Management Agency, withdrew from consideration. That came after it emerged Fine Gael had not been consulted on the plan to hire McDonagh, who was expected to keep his existing €430,000 salary. The “colossal” bill the State could soon be facing for missing EU-agreed climate targets, equivalent to a full year of corporate tax receipts or the annual health budget. A report by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and Climate Change Advisory Council provided one of the starkest warnings yet of the potential costs involved in failing to adapt to the climate reality. It found that the Republic – on a per capita basis – had the highest emissions target gap of EU member states, meaning it was the least likely to meet its 2030 target of reducing emissions by 51 per cent on the basis of its current trajectory. The drop in the State’s corporate tax receipts in May compared to a year earlier as the exchequer collected €2.5 billion, which was €1.1 billion less that May 2024. Downplaying the decline, the Department of Finance attributed it to “once-off factors” which, it said, boosted receipts last year and distorted the year-on-year comparison. No panic though as €10 billion in corporation tax was received in November, a record for a single month. The top percentile of richest households in the Republic holding almost half the wealth, according to Central Bank of Ireland data. The total net wealth of households here rose to a record €1.25 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, up €6.3 billion on the previous quarter. The figures showed that the wealthiest 10 per cent of households held €645 billion or 48.6 per cent of the total. This was five times the wealth held by the bottom 50 per cent of households, which stood at €117.8 billion or 8.9 per cent of the national total. [ One in 10 Irish households have net wealth of more than €1mOpens in new window ] The insurance industry’s final bill for Storm Éowyn, which struck Ireland in January, making it the most expensive insurance event in Irish history. The storm was one of the most damaging Ireland has ever faced, bringing gusts of 184km/h, breaking a record that had stood since 1945. Some 815,000 properties on the island lost power, with 768,000 of these in the Republic. Many were without power for weeks, while hundreds of energy technicians were drafted in from abroad to help ESB Networks with repairs. A breakdown of the final toll from the event released to The Irish Times shows a total of 33,768 claims were lodged. The estimated worth of a payment halted by State-owned energy company Bord na Móna for its chief executive after officials said continuing the “unsanctioned” earnings risked undermining public pay policy. The payment, which covered benefit-in-kind taxes on Tom Donnellan’s health insurance and company car, has been dropped from a new contract signed by the chief executive in April, the company confirmed. The value of PTSB after it put itself up for sale. The 57 per cent State-owned bank surprised the stock market by the move, which sent its market value up 23.4 per cent in Dublin. [ Paschal Donohoe must use PTSB sale to find owner with vision – not just a red penOpens in new window ] A deal would mark the return of all three domestic banks that survived the 2008 financial crisis to private ownership – and complete the recovery of the €29.4 billion in total that was injected into them. PTSB, by far the smallest of the three, has been dogged by low profit returns since the crash. This is largely due to its small scale – even after increasing its balance sheet by about 50 per cent between 2022 and 2023 after acquiring €6.8 billion of Ulster Bank loans. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ukrainian negotiations drag on, by Thierry Meyssan
URL: https://www.voltairenet.org/article223442.html

Full Content:
Peace negotiations in Ukraine are hampered by the Zelensky administration’s resistance. The administration is attempting to buy time, first through legal means, then through military means, and finally through political means. However, the contacts made suggest what this peace will look like. This article follows: 1 - “Straussians take control of the United Nations and NATO,” October 7, 2025. 2 - “Anti-Russian propaganda and preparations for war against Russia,” October 28, 2025. 3 - “The moment of truth: The West faces Russian military advances,” November 4, 2025. 4 - “The fall of the Zelensky regime and its allies,” November 25, 2025. 5 - “What lies behind the peace negotiations for Ukraine?” December 2, 2025. Peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are dragging on. Clearly, the Russian side, confident of victory, intends to liberate what remains of the Donbas as soon as possible, while the Ukrainian side refuses to concede anything. The Europeans of the EU and the UK are holding numerous meetings, almost one a day, with the sole obsession of continuing the war, with or without the United States. Two new events have changed the situation: Washington is considering leaving NATO, and the Ukrainians are accepting the idea of selling their country. On December 1st, a secret videoconference was held with the participation of: the French (Emmanuel Macron) and Finnish (Alexander Stubb) presidents, the German Chancellor (Friedrich Merz), the Polish (Donald Tusk), Italian (Giorgia Meloni), Danish (Mette Frederiksen), and Norwegian (Jonas Gahr Støre) prime ministers, the NATO Secretary General (Mark Rutte), the President of the European Commission (Ursula von der Leyen), and the President of the European Council (António Costa). According to Der Spiegel, which obtained a copy of the meeting’s minutes, the NATO Secretary General stated that he agreed with the Finnish president and that Europeans should be wary of the peace talks in Ukraine being negotiated by President Donald Trump’s special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. [1] This is the first time a sitting NATO Secretary General has dared to openly criticize a sitting US President. The National Security Strategy, published on December 4 by the White House, mentions NATO five times. However, it is no longer a crucial alliance for the United States, given that President Trump has declared the end of the "American Empire." Washington is too preoccupied with its $33 trillion debt to dedicate itself to the defense of Western Europe. The document therefore merely notes that the member states of the Atlantic Alliance will have to ensure their own security by allocating 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), a far cry from their current spending. It also notes that the alliance is not expected to expand further [2]. On December 9, five days later, a Republican representative, Thomas Massie (Kentucky), introduced a bill (HR 6508) aimed at withdrawing the United States from NATO. This bill was referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee on December 12 [3]. This is the first time this subject will be addressed in Congress. It is too early to draw any conclusions, but we must already acknowledge that there is a current within the Trump administration opposed to the Atlantic alliance, and that European states are aware that they will not be able to simultaneously ensure their own national defense and attack the Russian Federation. Privately, President Trump’s associates maintain that he will withdraw from the alliance by mid-2027; a deadline that could be brought forward. The leaders of the European Union are well aware of this. The President of the European Council, António Costa, declared on December 8th before the Jacques Delors Institute: “If we want to protect ourselves, not only against our adversaries, but also against allies who challenge us, we must strengthen Europe. We need to work together to build a Europe that understands that the relationships between allies and the alliances formed after the Second World War have changed.” Certainly, but EU members simply don’t have the resources of the United States. They cannot ensure their own defense alone. Moreover, if they wished to, they would have to organize themselves around one of the three nuclear powers in their region: France, the United Kingdom, or… Russia. A month ago, on November 11, Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, gave the signal for “Operation Midas.” The main allies of the unelected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, fell, one by one. It is inconceivable that he is not one of the main beneficiaries of the embezzlement of funds from Ukraine and the extortion of Ukrainian businesses. Yet no one dares to arrest him. Clearly, he is trying to cling to power to secure his gains or transfer them abroad. He first rallied Ukraine’s supporters, holding numerous meetings in Athens, Paris, London, Brussels, Rome, and Berlin, while his special representative and the secretary general of his Defense Council, Rustem Umerov, was already in hiding. Power in Ukraine is therefore now a shadowy affair: the unelected president could fall at any moment, and his chief negotiator can no longer return to his homeland. In an interview with Politico on December 9 [4], President Trump made the following statement: — Dasha Burns: Is it time for Ukraine to hold an election, do you think? — Donald Trump: Yes. I think so. It’s been a long time. It’s, uh... it hasn’t gone particularly well. Yes, I believe it’s time. I think it’s an important moment to hold elections. They’re using the war not to hold an election, but, uh, I think the Ukrainian people should... should have that choice. And maybe Zelenskyy would win. I don’t know who would win. But they haven’t had an election in a long time. You know, they talk about a democracy, but it’s getting to the point where it’s no longer a democracy. The unelected president immediately replied: "I am ready for elections. I am now asking, I am stating this openly, the United States to help me, possibly with European colleagues, to ensure security for holding elections." It is important to know that the Ukrainian Constitution prohibits elections during periods of martial law. Martial law was first imposed in 2018 by President Petro Poroshenko during the presidential election campaign [5]. Then, a second time, in 2022, by President Volodymyr Zelensky during the Russian special military operation. Martial law institutes nine measures: • Restrictions on the constitutional rights and freedoms of civilians; • Introduction of a "work obligation," applicable to everyone, whether employed or not, and which may include service in the military; • Seizure of state-owned property, or "forcibly disposing of" communal and private property "for the needs of the state"; • Introduction of a curfew; • Introduction of military checkpoints and restrictions on "the freedom of movement of citizens, foreigners, and stateless persons, as well as the movement of vehicles"; • Verification of individuals’ documents and inspection of their locations; • Prohibition of peaceful demonstrations, gatherings, and mass events; • Prohibition or restrictions on the media; • Prohibition or restrictions on the transfer of information on social media. In both cases, the aim was clearly to establish an authoritarian regime. While Poroshenko only implemented it for thirty days, Zelensky has renewed it every three months since February 2022. According to the sixteenth presidential decree on the matter that he promulgated, it is extended until next February. According to the Constitution, Volodymyr Zelensky’s term expired in May 2025. Since then, the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Ruslan Stefanchuk, should have been serving as interim president. Not only did he not request this position, but he accompanied the outgoing president on his initial trips to assert his legitimacy. If elections were held today, the electoral lists would be falsified, as hundreds of thousands of soldiers killed in action are still listed. Under these circumstances, it would be child’s play for the regime to rig the ballot boxes. The Russian side has repeatedly emphasized that it cannot sign a peace agreement with an illegitimate figure. It recalls that President Poroshenko declared the Minsk agreements, signed by his special envoy and predecessor, Leonid Kuchma, null and void overnight because this high-ranking official had not been validated by him or by the Verkhovna Rada. The announcement by the now unelected Ukrainian president that he would agree to hold elections is therefore likely just a way to buy time and further postpone peace. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) estimated the value of Ukraine’s rare earth elements at between $10 trillion and $12 trillion during a June 9, 2024 interview on "Face the Nation" (CBS News). President Trump had mentioned the possibility of transferring them to the United States a few months earlier to repay what the war cost them. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent traveled to Kyiv on February 12 to discuss the matter with President Zelensky. So, on December 10, the unelected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, convened a videoconference with Scott Bessent, Jared Kushner (not as a negotiator in Moscow, but as head of the Affinity Partners fund), and Larry Fink (head of the BlackRock fund and already owner of a large portion of the farmland) [6]. The purpose was clearly to assess what could be purchased in exchange for the rare earths. What was unthinkable ten months ago had suddenly become possible. A second meeting was held the following day, December 11. Zelensky brought together the main US negotiators and invited the NATO Secretary General. The aim was to review security guarantees, given that NATO is no longer a permanent entity.

Title: Just 1–2% – Here’s how retirement funds can change crypto forever

Even tiny allocations force exchanges and funds to adopt stronger practices. Retirement funds are built to be boring. That isn’t a flaw, it’s the point. They move as slowly as their beneficiaries, avoid surprises, and make the future feel manageable. On the other hand, crypto was built for the exact opposite. Because of this, it is often seen as too immature for pension money. This framing assumes that stability comes before participation. But, what if it works the other way around? Pension funds manage calendars, rather than money in the abstract. Salaries stop, pensions don’t. Assets that can drop in the double-digits as fast as you can say “crypto!” are difficult to square with that responsibility. Bitcoin, for all its growing legitimacy, still moves too much. In 2025 alone, it slid from near $120k to around $80k. This is a decline large enough to be called a “cycle” in crypto terms. However, this is a big problem in pension math. Crypto maxis know that this isn’t an outlier. Similar drops have been seen in the past too. Source: TradingView Price, though, is only part of the discomfort. Regulation remains uneven and often political, changing with court rulings and administrations. Custody has improved, but the industry hasn’t yet forgotten its own history. Exchange failures, frozen withdrawals, and creative accounting are still fresh in the mind, and even the rulebook is still being written. And then, there’s fiduciary duty. Pension managers are paid to avoid permanent loss, rather than explain it. By that measure, crypto still fails various tests. History has a way of taming assets that begin as inconvenient, volatile, and deeply unserious. This usually happens once large pools of patient capital decide it’s time to stop watching. Equities were the first. In the early 1900s, stock markets were thin, chaotic, and lightly regulated. Then, supervision changed everything. Pensions, insurers, and mutual funds arrived with scale, long time horizons, and a no-nonsense attitude. Disclosure standards followed. Audits became normal. The markets, eventually, behaved. When asked about the possibilities for crypto, Neil Staunton, CEO and co-founder of Superset told AMBCrypto, “Stablecoins, MMFs, RWAs, and the general tokenization of assets will bring institutional risk management into crypto markets.” However, he noted that it is not without its kinks. “The real risk is the absence of institutional standards. BlackRock was among the first to fully understand that risk.” Staunton noted that once BlackRock could change the risk profile, it had “the confidence to create an institutional product.” With this, the institution helped exchanges stop manipulation, making the asset reflect the true market. “Having mitigated those risks, they sold a product that became the fastest-growing ETF in history. Institutional best practices, once adopted, mature the market.” The CFA Institute has since put numbers to the pattern. Higher institutional ownership tends to bring better governance and greater stability over time. As it turns out, order in finance is… well, contagious. Property had its own makeover. Before institutional capital, real estate investing was local, illiquid, and occasionally opaque. Then came REITs (now a roughly $2 trillion global market) designed to translate bricks and rent into something we could actually live with. Municipal bonds followed a similar path as well. The capital arrived before the credibility. Crypto, for better or worse, may just be earlier in that same cycle. There is a particular kind of money that has no interest in being right quickly. Pension money arrives with time, and time has a way of changing rooms. Money that isn’t rushed makes markets quieter. Leverage looks less clever. What’s left is the work. The liquidity changes as well. Pension balance sheets aren’t dependent on cheap funding that vanishes under stress. They move slowly, if at all. With crypto, the instability will always remain but the extremes become less sharp. Even when pensions participate, they would do so carefully. Even a 1-2% crypto allocation would be diversified across assets, strategies, and risk buckets. That spreads exposure and reduces the maddening effects of the violent inflow-outflow cycles. And then, there are expectations. Audits. Custody. Risk frameworks. Habits carried over from more mature markets. Over time, those habits become standards, and the standards rearrange incentives. …and crypto is starting to see that now. Through infrastructure and scale. Source: downing.house.gov In the United States, this becomes clear if you look at ETFs and retirement frameworks. Since President Trump’s re-election, Washington has moved towards a more permissive stance on digital assets. This includes an executive order aimed at better access to crypto and other alternatives inside retirement plans. Source: SoSoValue The result has been a surge in regulated exposure. Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum ETFs have pulled in roughly $30 billion in net inflows YTD at the time of writing, led by products like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Source: SoSoValue Remember, none of these are fringe instruments. This matters because ETFs drag regulation with them. Court rulings, SEC approvals, custody rules, disclosure standards… none of these arrived because crypto asked nicely. Industry groups have been explicit too. Demand is strong, and the regulatory environment is adapting to meet it. Once pension systems, sovereign funds, and retirement plans engage (even cautiously), crypto becomes too systemically relevant to remain vague. For many pension systems, especially underfunded ones, instability is an existential concern. In the U.S, large public pension plans are 86.3% funded as of November 2025, per data from Milliman. This is a sign of sustained improvement; stronger balance sheets, but not unlimited risk tolerance. Source: Milliman Funds in that position simply do not have the luxury of absorbing big losses, no matter how compelling the long-term story is. Political risk hasn’t vanished either. Crypto regulations remain uneven across jurisdictions and borders, vulnerable to election cycles, court challenges, and sudden policy reversals. Even within the same country, there could be conflict. A more crypto-friendly posture at the higher level doesn’t automatically translate into support at the state or municipal level. Case in point – Key stakeholders continue to oppose New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani over his skepticism of crypto. His non-acceptance comes even with U.S policy growing more supportive after President Trump’s re-election. Then, there are the unresolved weaknesses. Fraud has not disappeared. Governance failures still surface. Custody infrastructure, while improving, is not foolproof. Even regulators acknowledge that oversight standards across exchanges and intermediaries remain inconsistent. So, no. This is not an argument that crypto is suddenly prudent. It is still risky. The difference is that it is no longer uniquely risky. Global pensions and retirement assets now run into the tens of trillions of dollars, spread across public funds, private plans, and sovereign systems. Against that backdrop, a 1-2% allocation to crypto is a rounding decision. And yet, even that small slice would matter, because that would change who the market is built for. Long-term retirement capital needs structure and rules that last. When it shows up, markets adjust. So, the real question is not whether pensions should take the leap with crypto. It is whether crypto ever truly grows up without them. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: America's affordability crisis is putting Aldi in the spotlight

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Newlyweds Brittany Zwier and Frank Martinez are starting their life together looking for ways to save money. Zwier, 32, and Martinez, 40, have an annual income of more than $100,000 — but are finding their dollars aren’t stretching as far as they used to. The couple now buys groceries exclusively at the no-frills supermarket chain Aldi, where they say the prices are cheaper than at other stores. “We’re just buying what we need right now,” Zwier said outside an Aldi in New Jersey. They have stopped buying beef, which hit record-high prices this year as climate and import issues limited cattle supply. Zwier and Martinez are not alone. For millions of Americans, the cost of living has risen sharply in recent years, fueled by a mix of persistent inflation, high interest rates, soaring energy costs and consumer price increases due to tariffs. More than half of respondents in a recent NBC News poll said they have changed the groceries they buy in order to stay within their budgets. In the same survey, the cost of housing and the cost of food ranked as the top two economic problems respondents said their families were facing. This affordability crisis continues despite recent signs pointing to a resilient economy. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones stock indexes both closed at record highs on Christmas Eve. And newly released data showed that GDP grew 4.3% in the third quarter of the year, much more than economists had been expecting. The spoils of a booming stock market are not being distributed evenly. Economists say consumers are separating into two distinct tiers — what they’re calling a K-shaped economy. “The K-shape economy means that some Americans, usually the wealthiest Americans, are doing just fine,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “They’re in the top of the K. Their incomes are rising. Their spending is rising.” But many on the lower end of the “K” are finding their paychecks can’t keep up with rising costs of food, housing, utilities and child care. “They feel like they’re falling behind, or, if on a good day, maybe treading water,” Long said. To keep their expenses in check, Zwier and Martinez have cut back on eating out. “Maybe once every three months now, we’ll go out,” said Martinez. “Used to be at least date night here and there. But that’s something we’re now sacrificing because everything is just too expensive.” Zwier and Martinez are part of a broader pullback in restaurant spending — one that is taking a bite out of fast-casual spots like Chipotle, Cava and Sweetgreen. “A lot of the chain restaurants have had a hard time in this environment where people don’t want to pay $15 to $20 for a burrito or a salad,” said Long. The K-shaped shift has also drawn the attention of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. “We’re seeing people tightening their belts, changing products that they buy, buying less,” Powell said at a recent press conference in Washington. And the price pinch many consumers are experiencing this year goes beyond food. Zwier and Martinez have seen their electric and gas bills skyrocket. “We’re using less, and it costs more,” Zwier said. Across the country, electricity costs have jumped 6.9% in the last year, more than twice the rate of inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This winter, U.S. households could spend an average of $995 on home heating alone, an increase of $84 from 2024, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. “These increases may not sound dramatic to higher-income households,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA. “But for families already struggling, they are devastating.” Budget retailers and grocers like Costco, Walmart and Aldi are well positioned to benefit from shifting spending habits among higher- and middle-income consumers. “We’re seeing shoppers across all demographics and income levels turning to Aldi, because the simple truth is that no one wants to pay more for groceries than they have to,” an Aldi spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. Aldi has seen explosive growth over the last decade. The grocer said it operated 1,230 U.S. stores in 2012. That number had nearly doubled to around 2,400 U.S. stores in 2023. And Aldi plans to expand further with 800 new stores nationwide by 2028. The discount supermarket chain has gained a reputation for low prices and a bare-bones approach. Coin-operated shopping carts, few name-brand products and items shelved in cardboard containers and crates are all part of the Aldi experience. The promise of low prices draws shoppers like Michael Torres, who said he has been coming to Aldi for the last couple years. Torres and his wife, who have a 1-month-old daughter, are finding ways to make ends meet on an income of less than $50,000 a year. “As much as you can save is important,” Torres said outside a New Jersey Aldi earlier this month. “You still want to make sure you have the fridge full, whatever you need on the table.” “There’s wants and there’s needs,” he added. “If you need something, you get it.” But for now, he said, some “wants” may have to wait. As many Americans pull back on spending, the U.S. economy has become increasingly dependent on high-income households. The top 10% of earners were responsible for a record 49.2% of total U.S. consumer spending in the second quarter of this year, according to Moody’s Analytics. Many businesses are seeing strong demand for their premium fare. Ford and General Motors recently reported soaring sales for their biggest and priciest SUVs. Some companies are also building out their higher-end offerings to draw in big spenders. This month, American Airlines debuted a splashy new plane with lie-flat seats and Bluetooth connectivity while budget carrier JetBlue just opened its first airport lounge. But economists warn that relying on a tiny slice of Americans to drive consumer spending could put the U.S. on shaky footing. Consumer spending makes up the lion’s share of the nation’s total economic activity. “Whether the economy goes into a recession in 2026 hinges almost entirely on the top 20%,” said Navy Federal Credit Union’s Long. “If they do well, the overall economy does well. If they don’t, then we’re looking at a recession.” In the meantime, she said, everyone else could face growing pressure. “Wage gains are going to keep getting smaller, and inflation, those basic costs, are going to keep ticking up,” Long said. “That’s a recipe for middle-class squeeze.” Kayla Steinberg is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Russia Launches Drone Barrage on Kyiv Ahead of Zelenskyy-Trump Meeting

Rescue workers extinguish a fire in a high-rise residential building in the Dniprovskyi district damaged by a Russian drone strike on December 27, 2025 in Kyiv, Ukraine. The attacks came as Trump and Zelenskyy are expected to discuss critical questions in a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, including its territorial sovereignty, NATO protections, and control over its natural resources. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his way to Florida for a pivotal set of talks this weekend with US President Donald Trump, Russia launched a barrage of drone and missile attacks on Kyiv early Saturday morning. At least two people were killed in the Ukrainian capital during the 10-hour attack, with 44 more—including two children—injured. Hundreds of thousands of residents are left to brave near-freezing temperatures without heat following the attack, which cut off power supplies. The attack came as Zelenskyy prepared to stop in Canada before meeting with Trump on Sunday to discuss a 20-point plan to end the nearly four-year war with Russia that has been the subject of weeks of negotiation between US and Ukrainian emissaries. Zelenskyy is seeking to maintain Ukraine's territorial sovereignty without having to surrender territory—namely, the eastern Donbass region that is largely occupied by Russian forces. He also hopes that any agreement to end the war will come with a long-term security guarantee reminiscent of NATO. On Friday, Zelenskyy told reporters that the peace deal was 90% complete. But Trump retorted that Zelenskyy "doesn't have anything until I approve it." Trump has expressed hostility toward Zelenskyy throughout his presidency. In February, before berating him in a now-infamous Oval Office meeting, Trump insisted falsely that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for starting the war in 2022. Zelenskyy's latest peace proposal was issued in response to Trump's proposal last month, which was heavily weighted in Russia's favor. It called for Ukraine to recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and cede the entirety of the Donbass, about 2,500 square miles of territory, to Russia, including territory not yet captured. Trump's plan puts a cap of 600,000 personnel on Ukraine's military and calls for Ukraine to add a measure in its constitution banning it from ever joining NATO. Earlier this year, Trump demanded that Ukraine give up $500 billion worth of its mineral wealth in what he said was "repayment" for US military support during the war (even though that support has only totalled about $175 billion). In his latest proposal, Trump has pared down his demands to the creation of a "Ukraine Development Fund" that would include the "extraction of minerals and natural resources" as part of a joint US-Ukraine reconstruction effort. While those terms appear less exploitative, the reconstruction program is expected to be financed by US loans from firms like BlackRock, which have been heavily involved in the diplomatic process. "The infrastructure rebuilt with these loans—ports, rail lines, power grid—won’t be Ukrainian in any meaningful sense. It’ll be owned by international consortiums, operated for profit, with revenues flowing out to service the debt," wrote the Irish geopolitical commentator Deaglan O'Mulrooney on Tuesday. "In other words, Ukraine will be gutted." Despite the criticism, Zelenskyy has signaled support in principle for the US reconstruction proposal as an alternative to direct expropriation. The "red lines" for Zelenskyy heading into his talk with Trump are related to Ukraine's territorial integrity. He has said he will not recognize Russian control of the Donbass, or the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, which Russia currently controls. He has also demanded that all terms of a peace agreement come up for a referendum among the Ukrainian people, which is strongly against territorial concessions. At the same time, however, he insisted Saturday that "Ukraine is willing to do whatever it takes to stop this war."

Title: Kelley Blue Book Says These 5 SUVs Are Some Of The Best Cars You Can Buy

Sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, are vehicles that have the tough frame of a truck but provide enough interior room for multiple passengers and cargo. And they aren't just popular among retirees with grandchildren or people fond of bulk shopping trips to stock up on items at Costco. There were $528 billion worth of SUV transactions in 2024 across the globe, a figure that is expected to swell to just over $876 billion by 2032, per Stellar Market Research. And SUVs and trucks were the best selling vehicles of the first three quarters of 2025 in the United States, according to Car and Driver. As a byproduct of their popularity, SUVs come in so many forms and models of varying quality that it is enough to put a car shopper into a fetal position of indecision, especially if you don't want to end up with a popular yet unreliable SUV. Fortunately, there's Kelley Blue Book, which has been a valuable source for automobile buyers since 1926. In early 2025, Kelley Blue Book came out with its Best Buy awards, which included Hyundai Kona, Honda CR-V, Kia Telluride, Ford Expedition, and Kia EV9. To give you a complete picture, we've included analyses and reviews from other online car sources in the roundup below. Rated as the best subcompact SUV, the Hyundai Kona is described by Kelley Blue Book as a roomy, comfortable, fuel-efficient vehicle that can get about 31 miles for the gallon. With a starting price of about $25,900, Hyundai Kona can seat five people with just over 38 inches of leg room and can carry 25.5 cubic feet of cargo, or a maximum of 63.7 cubic feet when the second-row seats are folded down. The vehicle comes equipped with a 12.3-inch infotainment display and an optional all-wheel drive. Plus, the 2025 Kona is equipped with standard safety features such as collision warning with automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring. Yet according to Edmunds, the 2025 Hyundai Kona's acceleration abilities are "underwhelming," while its suspension is not all that great, making it a less-than-ideal vehicle for off-roading (the model still got a 7.8 out of 10 rating). Consumer Reports, though, rated the 2025 Hyundai Kona overall reliability at 41 out of 100, about average for that model year. In terms of costs to fix and maintain, CarEdge estimated that a Hyundai Kona will cost $8,463 over its first ten years, which is $297 more than non-luxury SUVs. As for how quickly this car can depreciate, CarEdge says it will lose 42% of its value after five years. That's better than the 53% depreciation of a Wagoneer, a popular Jeep with terrible resale value. Kelley Blue Book compared the 2025 Honda CR-V — the winner of the best compact SUV category — to the brightest start in the sky for its quality, tech features, and the 76.5 cubic feet of cargo space it can provide once you fold down the rear seats. Though compact, the CR-V provides 41 inches of legroom for its rear seats along with reclining backs. And its hybrid versions can give up to 40 miles per gallon. But where the CR-V truly excels is in its resale value, which Kelley Blue Book reports can fetch thousands of dollars more than its competitors due to the Honda brand's reputation for reliability. CarEdge agreed, putting its depreciation at just 29% over its first five years. With a starting price of $31,495, the Honda CR-V costs $7,696 to fix and maintain in its first ten years of service, which is $530 less than the average for other popular SUV models. Also: Car and Driver called the 2025 model year a solid vehicle that's high in demand, and Edmunds gave it a 7.1 out of 10. However, this model was part of a recall ordered on Honda vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for potential fuel leaks and possibly incorrectly manufactured bad steering gearboxes. The winner of the best midsize SUV for the sixth year in a row, the 2025 Kia Telluride has a three-row configuration that can seat eight, a Mercedez-Benz-quality dual-display infotainment touchscreen, 21 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, and a total of 87 cubic feet with the two rear rows folded down, according to Kelley Blue Book. The model, which starts at about $37,800, also comes with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and a host of other safety features. In terms of reliability, Consumer Reports gives it an average with a score of 60 out of 100, although the vehicle also scored 72 out of 100 for owner satisfaction. Edmunds gives it a 7.1 out of 10 rating, while Car and Driver stated that Kia Telluride's standard features approach luxury standards. As for its resale value, the Kia Telluride will depreciate 51% in its first five years, according to CarEdge, and will cost $8,730 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $564 more than typical SUVs. The '25 Ford Expedition took Kelley Blue Book's best full-size SUV award for its three-row spacious interior with plentiful cupholders and USB-C ports, ability to tow trailers up to 9,600 pounds, and a variety of trims, like the Expedition Tremor, that are great for transverse unpaved trails. With a starting price of $64,515, it has a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot that allows people to stream music and audiobooks as well as videos when parked. There is even a Bluetooth controller for people to play online games. The second row has tablet holders on the back of the front seat headrests, and there is a 13.2-inch infotainment touchscreen for navigation and climate control. The vehicle also comes with a safety package that includes a 360-degree camera, emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot and lane-keeping assist functions. On the downside, according to Consumer Reports, the 2025 Ford Expedition is less reliable than the average car, with a reliability rating of 30 out of 100. It also costs $10,226 to maintain a Ford Expedition model in its first ten years of ownership, which is $2,060 more than other popular SUV models, per CarEdge. Ford Expeditions also depreciate 59% in five years, with a ranking of 164 out of 185 models analyzed by CarEdge for resale value. Large enough to seat seven people, the Kia EV9 won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy spot for 3-row EVs. An electric midsized SUV with prices that start at $56,395, the Kia EV9 can seat seven people comfortably, has a maximum range of 304 miles, and can get 150 miles worth of range after charging for only 15 minutes. Edmunds gave the model 8.2 out of 10, but Consumer Reports deemed the 2025 Kia EV9 less reliable than other cars of the same model year. There were also three recalls ordered by NHTSA because of a badly welded gear shift that causes the vehicle to lose power (342 vehicles for year 2025); possible missing bolts in the second and third row seats (22,883 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025); and a failing instrument panel screen for speed and other info (14,163 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025). But if those issues are addressed by dealerships free of charge, as expected, the Kia EV9 is projected to cost $5,237 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $2,929 better than the average SUV, per CarEdge. However, in five years it will lose 52% of its value.

According to Sharplink co-CEO Joseph Chalom, Ethereum could see a major jump in total value locked (TVL) next year if certain onchain trends pick up. Chalom put a bold number on it: 10X TVL in 2026. That claim ties together rising stablecoin use, bigger tokenization of real-world assets, and increased interest from big financial groups. Based on reports, the total stablecoin market stands at about $308 billion now and could grow to $500 billion by the end of next year, a rise of roughly 62%. Over half of all stablecoin activity — about 54% — happens on Ethereum. That math matters: more stablecoin flows on Ethereum tends to lift the protocol’s TVL because many of those dollars sit in smart contracts for swaps, lending, and liquidity pools. Sharplink Gaming holds 797,704 Ether, worth roughly $2.30 billion at the time of publication, a signal that some public treasuries are already staking big bets on the network. Chalom also expects tokenized real-world assets to expand rapidly, forecasting a $300 billion market for RWAs in 2026 and saying tokenized assets will 10X in AUM next year as funds, stocks, and bonds get wrapped onchain. In 2026, I believe Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) will increase 10X. Why and how? 🧵 Views ≠ investment advice. — Joseph Chalom (@joechalom) December 26, 2025 He points to rising interest from mainstream firms like JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock. Reports note that sovereign wealth funds may increase their Ethereum exposure by five- to tenfold, which could bring large, patient capital into tokenization projects and protocol deposits. Ethereum was trading near $2,921 on December 25, 2025, giving the network a market value of about $352 billion, while 24-hour trading volume came in at roughly $11.47 billion. Over the course of 2025, ETH moved through a full market swing. It opened the year around $3,298, climbed to about $4,390 in August, and stayed below its record high of $4,942, before sliding back to the $2,921 area by year-end. Price swings were heavy, with annual volatility close to 140%. Technical readings show mixed momentum. The weekly RSI sits at 41.7, placing Ethereum in a neutral-to-bearish zone, while the daily MACD histogram remains negative at -0.15. Price action has also been boxed into a narrow band between $2,774 and $3,038. Futures data adds to the cautious tone. Total open interest stands near $37 billion, down 0.62% over the past 24 hours, pointing to reduced exposure from traders. Liquidation data shows more than $100 million in potential long liquidations clustered between $2,880 and $2,910, an area now seen as a key pressure point. Not everyone agrees that token flows will translate into quick price gains. According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, Ether is unlikely to hit new highs next year given current Bitcoin conditions. That caution lines up with technicals that point to range-bound trading and with the fact that open interest has eased slightly. The liquidation cluster near $2,880–$2,910 shows where leveraged positions could be forced out, and that kind of stress can push price moves faster than fundamentals.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Nvidia Just Paid $20B for a Company That Missed Its Revenue Target by 75%

Time Published: 2025-12-27T16:47:13Z
Full Content:
If you’ve heard “Grok” thrown around lately, you’re probably thinking of Elon’s chatbot from xAI. We’re not talking about that one. That model isn’t particularly good, but its whole value prop is being politically incorrect so you can get it to say edgy things. The company Nvidia bought is Groq (with a Q). Totally different beast. If you’ve used any high quality LLM, you’ve noticed it takes a while to generate a response. Especially for something rapid fire like a conversation, you want high quality AND speed. But speed is often what gets sacrificed. There’s always that “thinking... gathering my notes... taking some time to form the best response” delay. Groq specialized in hardware and software that makes this way faster. They created a new type of chip called an LPU (Language Processing Unit). It’s based on an ASIC, an application specific integrated circuit. If that’s confusing, don’t worry about it. It’s just a processor that does a specific type of task really well. So imagine you’re talking to Gemini and it takes a couple seconds to respond. Now imagine it responded instantly, like 10 or 100 times faster. That’s the problem Groq was solving. To go one level deeper on LPUs versus GPUs (the processors most LLMs run on, typically Nvidia cards): those GPU calculations have to access a lot of things in memory. Nvidia’s chips depend on HBM, high bandwidth memory. But LPUs use something called SRAM that’s much faster to reference. Think about it like this. Your wife has a grocery list for you. You go to the store but forget the list. Every time you’re in an aisle, you have to call her on the phone: “Hey, do I need anything from the bread aisle?” Get the bread. Put the phone down. Go to the next aisle. “Hey, do I need anything from canned goods?” And so on through produce, meat, pick up the beer, check out, get home. Very inefficient. Groq’s approach is like you just took the list to the store. Get to a new aisle, look at the list. Next aisle, look at the list. Much faster than a phone call. That’s the key difference. Nvidia GPUs are phoning out every time they hit a new aisle. Groq’s LPUs mean the shopper has the list in their pocket. Groq’s main offering is GroqCloud. An engineer like me isn’t going to go out and buy an LPU (I don’t even know if they’re commercially available). What I’m going to do is, if I need lightning fast response in an application I’m building, I’ll use GroqCloud. That inference happens at an extremely fast rate, running on LPUs in a data center somewhere. Their value prop is: fast, cheap, low energy. Where they’ve been falling short is they mostly use open source models. Llama, Mistral, GPT-OSS (OpenAI’s open source offering). These are decent models, but nowhere near the quality of something like Anthropic’s Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro. Groq positioned themselves for hardcore use cases where milliseconds matter. One of their big industry fits is real time data analysis for Formula 1. When your driver’s out there on the track, you don’t have time to send a query to Gemini and wait 20 to 30 seconds to figure out if you should pit this guy for new tires this lap. You want something like Groq which does pretty good analysis, really really really fast. This is insider baseball you’re going to miss from mainstream news headlines. The media is paying attention to Grok (Elon’s chatbot), not Groq (the chip company). This isn’t a conspiracy, it’s just that the only people aware of Groq are software developers and tech nuts like me. This is a canary in the coal mine for worse things to come in 2026. About a year ago, Groq announced a $1.5 billion infrastructure investment deal with Saudi Arabia. They also secured a $750 million Series D funding round. These are crazy multiples even for a software company that’s somewhat leveraged in hardware. Bubble level projections. To visualize $1.5 billion: if you cashed that check out in $100 bills and stacked them one on top of another, it would reach a five story building. For ordinary plebeians like us, at the average US salary of around $75K, you’d need to work 20,000 years to earn that. At that time, the company was valued at $2 billion. Hello bubble. Then in maybe one of the best rug pulls of all time, in July they quietly changed their revenue projections to $500 million.1 A 75% cut in four months. I’ve never seen anything like that since the 2008 financial crisis. Prefer to Watch the Video This was a company valued at $2 billion, enough that the government of Saudi Arabia was investing at that valuation. Then they took a 75% haircut four months later without anything major happening. If it can happen to Groq, who else can it happen to? Nvidia? Intel? The rumors started flying on Christmas Eve. Confirmed the 26th: Nvidia will be buying Groq, their key product line, and key personnel including the CEO, for $20 billion. Let’s walk through that again: February: $2 billion valuation July: Down to $500 million December: Nvidia buys them for $20 billion after they took a 75% haircut What is going on? This is a bubble. The only explanation is this is a fear purchase. Groq was promising faster, cheaper, more efficient, less electricity use for their chips. But they couldn’t scale fast enough to compete with the vendor lock in and buddy system Nvidia has going. Nvidia’s buying them with their insanely inflated war chest. They don’t want a chunk taken out of their market share. They can’t afford to take that chance. So it’s like they’re just saying: “Shut up, take the $20 billion, walk away from this project.” This is a sign that in order to succeed, Nvidia needs a monopoly on the market. Otherwise they would not pay ten times the company’s valuation that was then decreased by 75%. This is a desperate move to consolidate the market into “you have to go with us.” Saudi Arabia didn’t keep that $1.5 billion sitting around. They redirected it to Nvidia and AMD instead. Nvidia still gets paid ofc. Smaller competitors like Cerebras and Inflection, doing things in Groq’s space or exploring different architectures for AI inference, are canceling IPOs, dropping like flies, seeking emergency funding. The chatter I’m hearing from VCs and friends in that world? Ain’t nobody buying it right now. Google made their own chip. Microsoft and Amazon are racing to make competition chips that run on less electricity, are more efficient, faster. But no matter what anybody does, the market is consolidating around the Nvidia monopoly for AI hardware. Engineers like me and architects at large enterprises are trying to escape this. Once they consolidate enough of the market, they can set their price for chips and usage. If you don’t own them, you go through Oracle or some cloud computing service, and they can charge whatever they want because there will be no competitors. Even a competitor having a rough time but getting some traction? They just buy them out for $20 billion because with this monopoly going, that’s pocket change. $20 billion is a rounding error to Nvidia. The AI infrastructure boom ran on one large errant assumption: that power is cheap and plentiful. That assumption was very, very wrong. We’ve seen parts of the power grid fail, go unmaintained. There’s a great article on Palladium called “The Competency Crisis” that explains some of what’s going on in the US right now. Electricity is now the bottleneck. It’s the constraint. Too expensive or you can’t get enough of it. Who’s paying these costs? The tech companies aren’t. Trump is meeting with Jensen Huang, with Sam Altman. He hasn’t been over my place lately. He hasn’t invited you to the White House to talk about how you can’t afford groceries and eggs cost three times what they did a few years ago. No. You and I are going to pay to subsidize the electricity constraints. US data centers are using about 4% of all electricity right now. If growth continues at the same rate, in ten years they’ll use 9%. Almost one tenth of all electricity generated in the US. I’m not much of an environmentalist. But even someone like me, pretty jaded to some amount of waste because of industrialization, something like this actually makes my stomach turn. In places with lots of data centers, AI heavy regions, they’re experiencing about a 250% increase in energy costs compared to just five years ago. That’s huge. Even compared to grocery costs, which are out of control. At least with food you have alternatives. Red meat too expensive? Buy chicken. Chicken too expensive? Buy eggs. But electricity? You have to run electricity. It’s a public utility. You can’t just “use a lot less” when your bill goes up 2.5x. Let me walk you through what happens. Some business development guy from Oracle wants to build a new data center in Rural America. A year before it’s even built, they meet with city officials, maybe the governor. They grease the right people. Get legislation passed with the utility companies that says they’ll pay a preferential rate for electricity because they’re going to use a shit ton. They’re Oracle or Nvidia, they’re good for it. They pay five years upfront. Then the utility decides what to do with the rest of the electricity. The grid is strained. They want everyone else to use less. They can’t just tell them to use less, so they keep raising the price until naturally you just can’t afford to use more. You turn the lights off. Turn the TV off. Get those LED bulbs that disrupt your sleep. Do everything to keep electricity costs down. But you and I are left holding the bag. The data center folks aren’t paying for that, they paid upfront at a preferential rate. Senate Democrats are allegedly investigating this. I’ll believe it when I see it. These tech companies have their hooks so far into influential politicians. It’s a vote grab. I’d be happy to be wrong about that, but I know I’m not going to be. I talked about this in my last piece on the AI bubble. This computer communism that’s going on, pricing you out of personal computing, keeping it all in the family of these tech companies. But with the Groq deal confirmed, it’s gone one step further. Nvidia is not just selling chips anymore. They are lending money to customers who buy the chips. They are artificially inflating demand. It’s like if I run a small grocery store and I need to show good signal to investors that I’m bringing cash in the door. So I go downtown during farmer’s market and give everybody a $20 voucher to use at my store. I take a wholesale hit when they come in and buy stuff. But what I can show is: “Hey, people are coming in and spending money. Look at the revenue. Give me more venture capital money.” This can’t work infinitely, for the same reason any perpetual motion machine can’t work. Back in September, Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI. Coming through in $10 billion tranches over time. And it’s not equity, it’s lease agreements for Nvidia’s chips. Literally paying them to pay themselves.There’s probably some tax shenanigans going on there since they’re typically offering $xxx in leases of their chips to the company they’re “lending” to. Assuming they do this in part because the depreciation on the physical asset (the chips) can be written off on their taxes somehow. They’re essentially incentivizing another person to use them with money. Even OpenAI’s CFO has admitted, quote: “Most of the money will go back to Nvidia.” They’re playing both sides. In the OpenAI case, they’re financing software that uses their chips. But they’re also getting their hooks into data centers. CoreWeave: they have something like 7% share in the company. Worth $3 billion. That’s funded by GPU revenue from CoreWeave. Lambda: another data center operator. That’s a $1.3 billion spending deal. Renting Nvidia’s own chips back from them. They’ve pledged to invest £2 billion across British startups, which of course are going to go back to Nvidia chips one way or another. In 2024, they invested about $1 billion across startups and saw a $24 billion return in chip spend. They 24x’d their billion dollar investment in one year. Nvidia has more power than the Fed right now. More power than the president over the economy. They have their hand on the knob of the economy. They can choose how fast or slow they want it to go. If the Nvidia cash machine stops printing, if they stop funding startups, data centers, hardware companies, software companies, that whole part of the economy slows way down and maybe crashes if investors get spooked. I’m waiting for somebody to blow the whistle on this. I’m not a finance guy, so it’s strange I’m even talking about it. But their entire success story for the next couple years hinges on their $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which they’re expecting to bring back about $300 billion in chip purchases. It’s vendor financing. It’s sweetening the pot on your own deals. I cannot believe more people are not talking about this. OpenAI, the leader of this space, the company whose CEO Sam Altman is invited to the White House numerous times, probably has a direct line to Trump, a lot of the economy hinges on this guy’s strategy, opinions, and public statements. And he runs a company that is not profitable. Actually insane if you think about it. All he’s done with that company, from an economics point of view, is rack up debt. Spent more than he’s earned. By that metric, I’m richer than Sam Altman. Not in net worth. But if I consider myself a business and the fact that I bring in any salary at all, even a dollar a year, that would make me earn more than Sam Altman, who has only lost money. In the next few years, they’re expected to burn something like $75 billion a year. Just set that money on fire. I have a credit card with no preset spending limit, but I assume if I run up a $75 billion charge it’s going to get denied. By their projections, they think they’ll become profitable around 2029/2030, and they need $200 billion in annual revenue to offset their debts and losses. To visualize $200 billion: if you cashed that out in $100 bills and stacked them, it would reach halfway to the International Space Station. That’s how much they’d have to make every single year to just be profitable. Not be a massively successful company. Just to not spend more than they earn. 2024: Spent $5 billion, earned $3.7 billion. Spending $1.35 for every dollar earned. 2025: Set $8 billion on fire (after profits). 2028 (projected): Will lose $74 billion that year. Just lose it. Cumulative losses through 2029: $143 billion. They’d need to make $200 billion in a year to offset that. Are they including interest? I have no idea how these things work, but in simple terms: they’re spending a lot more money than they make. Groq was kind of a one off because Nvidia panic bought the competition. But they also need to figure out how to get prices down or they can’t keep this money machine moving. Groq is probably one of the last companies that caught a good lifeboat off a sinking ship. What we’re going to see this year: it’ll start small, but get major. A company first, then multiple larger ones, that had a 2025 valuation, will go to raise. They’ll do a 409A evaluation. A bunch of smart analysts will say what it’s worth to investors. And you’re going to see the valuation drop. They won’t be able to raise money. Then the shit is really going to start to hit the fan. The dominoes will start falling. That’s probably what kicks off the actual pop, and it’s imminent. Any day now. Part of the big gamble they’ve sold investors is: we’ve got to replace you. The worker. That’s why we need to spend so much money, go into debt. It’ll all be worth it because then we won’t have to pay people to do these jobs anymore. We’re going to continue to see massive labor displacement. To a degree this is a shell game, an investor illusion. What these larger enterprise companies are hoping to do: cut a lot of folks, have big layoffs, say it’s because AI is replacing the jobs. In some cases they’re right. Data entry, for example. I don’t mean to be mean if you do data entry for a living, but there are models very good at that now. You need someone to manage the work, spot check it. But it’s kind of a job AI can do. Like how grocery stores have automatic checkout lines now with one person monitoring six or eight of them. So some of that’s real. A lot of it isn’t though. They cut a bunch of American workers under the guise that AI’s replacing workers. A lot of these megacorp execs are actually convinced of it. Americans are expensive, especially tech workers. Then they see: damn, maybe we could have cut some, but not as many. We got greedy. Now our services are failing in production. AWS in Northern Virginia is flaky, going down again. That just happened, by the way, direct result of these layoffs. So instead they think, “We’ll look globally! Spin up a campus in Hyderabad!” Pay them way less. The cost of living is less there, they expect less. Bring them over on H-1B when needed. I’ve written about the H-1B program. This is nothing against the individuals on that program. I’ve worked with very talented H-1Bs, and some very inferior ones, just like American citizens. But the corporate sleight of hand is something like this, we can get those H-1B visas, and they’re not going to ask for pesky stuff like Sunday off for church. We can put them on call 24/7 and they can’t say no because if they do, we kick them back to their country. Same thing that’s happened with migrant labor in farming over the past century. Even if it doesn’t look like it on the surface, corporations know that they can pay H-1B employees less than American citizens. If a US citizen and H-1B recipient both make $120k but the H-1B works double the hours because they have no room to push back and are under threat of being sent home, they are making 50% less than the American per-hour. Amazon/AWS: 14,000 laid off. Microsoft: 15,000 total just in 2025. Salesforce: My favorite one. 4,000 customer support roles cut. And the CEO is gloating about it in interviews. So great that he can replace workers! Now Salesforce is admitting that they fucked up. They cut too many people. I’ve been on the other side of this when I was an engineering director at a Fortune 500 company. They were neurotic about tracking AI use. Spending an exorbitant amount of money on shitty AI tools. Like tools from a year ago. GPT-4o in the GPT-5 era, in the Anthropic dominance era. More or less useless. Not only would they monitor all usage across employees, specifically who’s using it how much, they could see every single message being sent to the AI. So theoretically you could check somebody’s queries and do a performance evaluation based on where you perceive them to be. Pretty creepy. They’re using yesterday’s tools because of regulation and compliance, blowing an absurd amount of money. The CEO just sees a lot going out the door: “I thought these were supposed to save money, what’s going on here?” So his lieutenants have to get a grip on it, monitor everything. Even at Amazon this is being included in performance reviews, how much they’re using AI. That’s why if you’re a software developer wondering why your boss is on you about using AI tools. They’re probably getting pressure from their bosses. I want my engineers to be as productive as possible. I think AI is probably part of that tool belt for everyone at this point. But is tracking it really the best way? I’m going to gauge performance on metrics, how you interacted with the team, what you shipped. It puts the cart before the horse to say you’re paid by how much you use these AI tools. If I’m a developer, I’m just spinning up a script to send lorem ipsum text 24 hours a day, get maximum ratings because I used GPT-3.5 the most. MIT did a study in summer 2025. They’re saying 95% of companies report zero measurable ROI on AI products. Actually not that crazy if you consider that a lot of them did layoffs and subbed in AI. That’s just going according to plan in my estimation. They estimate about $30 to $40 billion has been spent on enterprise AI. That’s the money your JPMorgan Chase is spending for their engineers to use Claude Code or whatever dated tool they have access to. The market heard that signal. When that study came out: Nvidia crashed 3.5% Palantir down 10% Nasdaq in general down 1.2% That last one isn’t encouraging for an AI bubble pop because it indicates this is a big part of the economy. January through February: Maybe down valuations, just a very flat market without much growth. Q1 to Q2: We’ll start to see a couple businesses, or maybe one major one at first like a domino starting to fall, not able to raise capital at their 2025 valuation. We’ll see valuations go down. VCs will be like: “Not touching it, not giving them more money, cutting our losses.” Then timing a little more indeterminate but these things will happen quickly in succession: Credit markets start to tighten Debt refinancing pressure builds up in the system Nvidia revises its revenue guidance to something at least vaguely linked to reality And that’s when the big reckoning begins. I want to be clear. AI is not going anywhere. It’s going to continue being a mainstream part of the world. I like a lot of these tools, I think they’re very helpful. But the talking heads have really promised us the world. It’s clear the technology cannot deliver above and beyond what it’s doing now. We’ve seen progress of these models slow at an exponential rate of slowing over the past few releases. Each release is better, but the gap between the current release and the last release is much smaller than it used to be. Because of that, a lot of these AI companies are going to survive, but their valuations are going to get giga slashed. Valuations of $500 billion for OpenAI, $42 billion for Anthropic are unsustainable. We’re going to actually see them become unsustainable in 2026 as they’re eventually cut. Smaller companies will face those slashes first. But it’s coming for the major AI labs as well. This is good news, honestly. This AI hype has really turned tech into something different these days, different than it used to be. While I don’t feel AI is going anywhere, I do feel we’ll get a little more back to normal once this bubble pops and resolves. What do you think? Drop a comment below.

Title: 3 Reasons Broadcom Crashed 15% on Blockbuster Earnings — And the Real Reason to Load Up Now

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / tech_BG Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered stellar fiscal fourth-quarter results earlier this month, with record revenue, beating analyst estimates. AI-driven growth powered the performance, yet the stock tumbled sharply afterward, dropping as much as 21% from $405 per share before the report to $321 per share in the following days. While Broadcom shares have since recovered some ground, they remain approximately 15% below their pre-earnings levels. This selloff is the result of a disconnect between strong fundamentals and the market’s reaction. There are three key reasons behind the decline in Broadcom stock, but these concerns open up an opportunity for investors to buy at a lower price. Broadcom reported net revenue of $18 billion for the period, a 28% increase from $14 billion a year earlier. Semiconductor solutions revenue reached $11.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year, while infrastructure software contributed $6.9 billion, up 19%. AI semiconductor revenue was exceptionally strong, rising 74% year-over-year to $6.5 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.95 per share, up 37% from the year-ago quarter, with adjusted EBITDA at $12.1 billion, for margins of 68%, which was also 34% higher than last year, allowing Broadcom to generate a 36% increase in free cash flow to $7.5 billion. CEO Hock Tan highlighted the momentum, noting AI revenue growth drove the results. Broadcom also offered robust guidance for Q1, projecting revenue of $19.1 billion, up 28% year-over-year, with AI semiconductor revenue expected to double to $8.2 billion. Semiconductor revenue is forecast at about $12.3 billion, up 50%, underscoring continued demand acceleration. While AI-related order backlog of over $73 billion — deliverable over 18 months — was substantial, representing nearly half of the consolidated $162 billion backlog, was lower than anticipated for the pace of AI demand. This backlog includes custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking components like the Tomahawk 6 switch, with over $10 billion in orders for the latter alone. Management described bookings as “unprecedented” in recent months, but the specific backlog number contributed to perceptions of moderating momentum. Where gross margins were 77.9%, management said it expected a sequential decline of about 100 basis points in Q1 due to a higher mix of AI revenue, including passthrough costs in rack-level solutions. AI semiconductors, particularly custom chips and systems, carry lower margins than traditional products. Semiconductor gross margins are around 68%, compared to 93% for infrastructure software. As AI becomes a larger portion of revenue, this mix shift is expected to dilute overall margins slightly, even as absolute operating profit dollars grow. A third concern was the outlook for infrastructure software, primarily from VMware. Although segment revenue grew 19%, guidance called for low double-digit growth next year, with Q1 at $6.8 billion, only 2% higher year-over-year. This deceleration from prior rates raised questions about sustained momentum in the software segment, which has offered high-margin stability. Despite the stock’s tumble, Broadcom’s outlook remains robust, driven by accelerating AI demand that management describes as a multiyear trend. AI revenue is on track to double in Q1, fueled by custom accelerators and Ethernet networking. The company has also diversified its customer base, adding a fifth XPU client with a $1 billion initial order for delivery in late 2026, alongside follow-on commitments worth $11 billion from existing hyperscalers. Networking backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion, reflecting strong deployment needs. Moreover, bookings have surged recently, with visibility into leading-edge nodes and advanced packaging secured through facility expansions. Non-AI semiconductors remain stable, supported by a recovery in broadband. Broadcom continues to deliver strong capital returns, raising its dividend 10% and extending a $7.5 billion repurchase program. These factors point to sustained growth in 2026 and beyond. Broadcom is likely to surprise the market in future earnings reports with its strength, making the drop in its stock today the time to buy. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Tech layoffs in 2025: From TCS to Amazon — these IT firms laid off over 1,00,000 employees amid AI reshaping market

Amid artificial intelligence (AI) shaping the market, tech layoffs continue to hit workers across the world following a bruising year, in which over 100,000 people lost their jobs. Although the pace of layoffs has slowed slightly over the last few weeks, the impact remains significant, with around 122,549 tech workers being laid-off from 551 tech companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. Some of the biggest pink slips came from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Salesforce, Amazon, and Microsoft — collectively affecting hundreds of employees. These job cuts are often linked to artificial intelligence, as companies are looking for ways to cut expenses amid rising costs from inflation and tariffs. In such times, hiring fewer employees and relying on AI can seem like an appealing short-term solution for companies. Several major tech companies have announced large scale of workforce reductions this year. Some notable examples of these layoffs include: — Amazon: The e-commerce giant announced the largest ever round of layoffs in its history in October this year, slashing 14,000 corporate job roles, as it seeks to make more investments in its “biggest bets” which includes AI. — Microsoft: The US-based tech giant has cut a total of 15,000 jobs through 2025, and its most recent restructuring announcement coming in July, which saw 9,000 employees losing their jobs. — TCS: India's largest tech company also joined the wave of companies laying off its employees. It announced a 2% reduction in its workforce, equating to nearly 12,000 jobs, which sent shockwaves to the country's IT industry. The company also refused claims that the job losses were due to AI replacement, citing skills mismatch and an evolving business model as the real reasons behind the move. — Intel: The chipmaker announced in July that it had mostly completed cutting 15% of its workforce. Intel had employed 109,800 people at the end of 2024, with 99,500 of them classified as ‘core employees’. However, the chipmaker said that it wants to end the year with around 75,000 core employees. — Salesforce: The company's CEO Marc Benioff confirmed in September that 4,000 customer support workers had been cut at the firm with the help of AI. He had revealed over the summer that AI was already doing up to 50% of the work at the company. However, some recent news reports also indicate that alongside these cuts, Salesforce is also planning to hire more staff. — HP: In November, the PC maker said that it plans to cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs globally through fiscal 2028 as it aims to streamline operations and integrate artificial intelligence across workflows to speed up product development, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity. — Apple: According to a Bloomberg report, iPhone maker Apple has laid off dozens of sales workers across the United States in November, in a rare job cut for the tech giant. Although the exact number could not be verified. — Meta: As per news reports, Instagram's parent company Meta said in October that it plans to lay off 600 employees in its AI division, with the aim to build new products faster. — Google: The tech giant laid off 100 of its employees in design-related roles in October as part of its ongoing push to accelerate its AI agenda. A month earlier, the company had also reportedly cut more than 200 contractors working on its AI projects, including Gemini and AI Overviews. — Verizon: The US wireless carrier announced in November that it will lay off more than 13,000 employees marking its largest single job cut drive triggered by plans to shrink costs and restructure operations. — Siemens: The German tech firm cut 5,600 jobs at its Digital Industries business in March. The job cuts amount to a little more than 8% of the 68,000 people employed in Digital Industries globally.

And if the author was prepared to pay forty-four bucks for two of them, it just goes to show you that he has more dollars than sense. I’m hoping he made more than that for the article and can chalk it up as an expense. The author got paid for the article. It’s business expense. Re: Hainan The author of that tweet and substack doesn’t seem to understand that for the past 3 decades or so, every business that has sought to sell in China, manufactures in China. Importing has always been a fraught business for any company in China, there are just too many bureaucratic obstacles for anything except raw materials imports. The move to offshore to Vietnam, Indonesia, etc., has been driven by exporters from China, not companies wishing to sell in China. Since it’s just a customs free area for China, it will almost certainly only attract investments from companies already within China, and already selling within China. There may be good regional development reasons for this, but in terms of overall growth, its not likely to generate any real investment – this is why (for example), the Tories proposed Freeports around the UK went nowhere. Most likely, the justification is internal, specifically to complete the weakening of HK and Macau as economic powerhouses. Shanghai has already take up much of HK’s former financial role. There may also be a desire to create an alternative growth pole away from the traditional arc from the Yellow Sea to the Yangtze Delta. If it does indicate a strategic reset towards the western seaboard of China, then the Vietnamese in particular will be looking very closely at how to respond. Oddly enough, the best stats I could find from my neck of woods, only around 8% of the companies that export to China have a subsidiary there – the 92% manufacture somewhere else (mostly here). That is from 2023, so it indeed falls within the last three decades. Already over a decade ago I heard a comment by the CEO of Genelec that “one can’t compete with the Chinese in price, the secret is to make so good stuff the Chinese come and buy it regardless of the price”. “Trump tempers Zelensky’s optimism on peace plan The Hill” links to an Axios article. Here’s the correct link: https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5663887-trump-zelensky-peace-plan/ From the Axios article: “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Axios on Friday that he hopes to agree on a framework with President Trump for ending the war when they meet on Sunday. Zelensky also revealed he’s willing to bring that plan up for a referendum if Russia agrees to a ceasefire of at least 60 days” They just keep playing the “ceasefire” broken record as if the Russians are somehow gonna fall for it if they repeat it long enough. I imagine now that they need a ceasefire to hold the referendum. True brain geniuses in the British government these days. Thanks, fixing. I had considered linking to the Axios piece but its headline claim was bogus. Mercouris has already picked apart Zelensky’s offer that Axios depicted as new (adding the “60 day” specifier does not change the basic idea). “Have Germans finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?” The answer is probably no as German media is all in on the propaganda effort and everything that Germans say online is being watched like a hawk with punishment meted out from time to time. Plus alternate views are banned in Germany and the EU such as the Russian RT & Sputnik. I mean here, you may as well ask ‘Have Americans finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?’ or ‘Have the British finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?’ The answers to both questions would also apply to the Germans. Rev Kev: ‘Have the British finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise.’ Actually, the majority have, I’d guess. The problem is the media and TPTB relentlessly keep shoveling the sh*t to allow no break in the narrative. such as the Russian RT I’m typing this in a hotel room in Munich. No problem getting RT. You are blessed, channels such as press tv,russia today have been removed from circulation in my tiny and toney part of the collective west. When I’ve visited in Deutschland, MSNBC and Bloomberg are the only english language options. Their view of the world rarely chimes with my experience or understanding of it. Slop did not start with the AI con. That’s an odd one that. Back in 2022 the EU banned RT & Sputnik for “disinformation”- https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-bans-rt-sputnik-banned-over-ukraine-disinformation-2022-03-02/ And yet a 2024 article states that in many EU countries you can still get them. Then again the European parliament wants to ban them from its IT infrastructure as of a few months ago. So maybe a rule more honoured in the breach sort of situation? Indi Samarajiva, at it again. They Corrupt and Call It Peace. Or, they are corrupt and what they deign to offer as peace is rotten. An observation well known in Europe (although not acknowledged by most of the media outlets): “Von der Leyen failed upwards by A) doing corrupt defense deals on her phone and deleting evidence in Germany B) doing corrupt vaccine deals on her phone and deleting evidence for the EU. What mere mortals would consider ruinous scandals are really just a successful job application within White Empire.” What Indi Samarajiva reports has been covered here at Naked Capitalism, but you should read the essay because it is compact, well argued, and spicy indeed. Oreshniks to Belarus — https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1221212/possible-oreshnik-deployment-in-belarus/ Not unexpected, of course. Of the two authors here, back when I was doing journalism I used Lewis as a source and my sense was, while he’d no technical knowledge (degrees in policy and philosophy bs) as long as he was backed up/fronting for a technical person) he was sort of okay. He has a technical person as a co-author here. The British tabloid press is soberly reporting on all this, of course– Russia moves terrifying hypersonic nuclear missiles closer to UK in WW3 terror https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2150812/russia-moves-terrifying-hypersonic-nuclear-missiles TBF, the Daily Express also reported last week that Russian troops were forced to eat each other as they were not being supplied with food. https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2148914/putins-desperate-troops-so-short The Express is probably the worst of the rabid right wing British tabloids. Take whatever they report and how they frame reporting with a bushel of salt rather than a pinch. Pavel Podvig relating to Lewis´s post: Oreshnik in Belarus? There are reasons to be skeptical https://russianforces.substack.com/p/oreshnik-in-belarus Podvig posted the only comment under the Lewis post btw. p.s. However I am not sure any more what to think about Lewis…his proximity to Dems. is odd and out of place. Am always suspecting he downplays or overplays things depending on what may be fitting ideology best. Just like the last paragraph: “(…) impending deployment of Typhon to Germany, and possible future deployments of Dark Eagle (…) Although these systems are purely conventional, Putin has raised the prospect that they could be converted to nuclear-armed systems that could decapitate the Russian leadership in Moscow. This is precisely what he is now doing, by placing Oreshnik in Belarus. (…)” Right! Because Belarus is bordering to Virginia. I didnt´know that. “Why Does the West Hate Russia?” I’m not sure what is to be done here. This hatred goes back at least two centuries and is firmly embedded in the EU countries especially the Baltic States. It is even worse in the UK but mostly in the political elite who are rabid over the subject of Russia. And through emigration, these hatreds have made their may across the Atlantic and has found fertile ground in Washington DC. Victoria Nuland may be an example here. I’m not sure how you dig your way out of this hatred which right now is warping the policies of many western countries to the point that they are destroying their own country in a vague hope of destroying Russia. I don’t know if the Sachs essay that was linked there has been in the NC links but it’s a very good read. I learned a few things, especially about the machinations on German neutrality and eventual rearmament in the 1950s. https://consortiumnews.com/2025/12/24/jeffery-sachs-two-centuries-of-russophobia-rejection-of-peace/ My view of Adenauer is diminished, not that I had any belief that he was a great statesman. It’s too bad that Sachs didn’t get into the Sino-Soviet split, De Gaulle recognizing the PRC, Nixon going to China, etc. I always wonder how much Russophobic treachery was involved in those events. Fascinating stuff. Hate is a strong word. I’d call it a healthy distrust. My ancestors have dealt with several Russian invasions. I do not doubt that Russia will try to invade Eastern Europe again someday. If the Baltics keep cozying up to the corrupt US and Western Europe and promoting warmongering crazies like Kaja Kallas, you prophecy will no doubt become true. Yes, calling Russians “orcs” and Russia “Mordor” is healthy, humanizing and perfectly normal way to express distrust 🥲 And as Sachs points out, Russia has many reasons for holding a “healthy distrust” of Europe. But I’m curious. When you say you “do not doubt” that Russia will try to invade Eastern Europe again, on what is this certainty based? The past? Because I have seen no evidence whatsoever of this likelihood after the fall of the Soviet Union, and (as Sachs also points out) much evidence of Russia’s desire for European integration. On the other hand, Russian fears of invasion by the West were reinforced by US/NATO actions almost immediately after the Soviet collapse, and continue to be. I’m not naive. I’m not trying to whitewash past Russian actions, and I understand the effects on historical memory and prejudice. But I honestly cannot see the evidence for such fears of some new Russian imperialist expansion. I am honestly interested in what such evidence might be. Especially since, as I say, there is plenty of reason for Russia to fear the West. “Invade” is a dodgy concept these days. Note that Kaja Kallas included, iirc, 1944 among her “Russian invasions.” I’m not so naive as to believe Russia does not “invade” in general, but they tend to be “defensive” in nature, afaict, such that potential invaders can generally avert by playing diplomacy carefully (see Cold War Finland, and, to a lesser degree, most of the Eastern Bloc–Of course, how much room the countries on the other hand might be quite limited and Russians might not give them too much leash–eg Czechoslovakia in 1968. But such interventions strike me as both more complex than mere “invasions” and not particularly unusual in Great Power-Small Power politics, unpleasant though they might be.) In the real world, attitudes toward Russia differ wildly across Eastern Europe. Usually, but not always, this follows the Orthodox/Western Christianity line of demarcation, but for instance in Slovakia national identity is historically bound up with pan-Slavism and hence Russia. “Eastern Europeans all hate and fear Russia” is just propaganda. Usually the people who say this are from the Baltics, Romania, or Western Ukraine, where it is coupled with an idea that “we are defending Europe from the Asians,” which I suspect (I 100% know in the case of WU) is linked to their past as allies of Germany in WW2. Ally of Germany carries a lot of water for a Romanian. The first to snatch a piece from the territory of Greater Romania was Germany, to pay upfront Hungary as a future ally. Then it allowed USSR to take Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940. Romania joined Germany in order to recover those territories lost because of Germany. And then it changed sides and regained Northern Transylvania… With allies like Germany… n=1 but….A very good friend, Polish, opened Dun & Bradstreet’s office in Moscow in 1994. She got on swimmingly with the Russians. But she was not a typical Pole. Among other things, her family harbored Jews during WWII. Russia is the biggest part of Eastern Europe (and used to be much bigger), so your prophecy is true by default. As a matter of fact they are invading Eastern Europe as we speak. Nostradamus stuff indeed. Also. it’s funny that you fail to give any deatils of your ancestors, and their dealings with all those unprovoked full-scale invasions. Reminds me of a recently erect memorial in Canada, that had to blank the names of the “victims”. My Lithuanian ancestors invaded Russia and occupied some of it for almost 2 centuries. I have no doubt the Balts, Poles, Germans along with their western European allies aspire to control Russia again. My deceased elders and Lithuanian relatives HATE Russia and Russians; nothing healthy about that. They have a KKK and Nazi mentality. This goes back to the schism. In Bulgaria (Eastern Orthodox) there is a distinct subset of people with Russia Derangement Syndrome that borders on clinical pathology. There’s no informed argument to be had with them, everyone who exhibits even a mild doubt as to the immaculate blamelessness of the West for the war is automatically labeled a Putinist. Which is kind of funny, considering that they bring up historical grievances going even further back in history than Putin. That is kind of odd, given that it was largely the Russian army that created the independent (in practice, at least) Bulgaria. Well, their answer for that is that Russia didn’t do it out of pure altruism. Which is at least partly the case, but these are creatures wedded to moral absolutism towards others, if only rarely willing to acknowledge their own failings in the morality department. People seem to forget – social networks – especial the haves at a given moment in time “that perceive” a loss of status – ???? [waves@Ayn Rand sorts] – be it power too shape reality or material wealth … don’t go poof when one age cohort expires … its passed down as environmental bias e.g. this whole world is full of peoples[tm] that at one time were BSD and then poof … I think Toynbee was correct about the basic 3 levels of any society. In saying that I had some fun with my Samsung TV a few years ago as it had a Samsung channel that depicted early European/Asia&Minor history. Used to speed it up and the contracts made and broken between ruling classes was Epic … so much cannon fodder … Yes, partly it’s the perceived loss of status by the “landed gentry” (given Ottoman rule, they became landed and propertied by way of scammery, thievery and thuggery after independence, often legitimizing their gains by supporting the anti-Russian governments after Reunification). It’s little wonder that that the most vociferous russophobia one encounters is from members of the so-called “restitute class”, whose restored properties in choice locations in and around Sofia make them a genuine rentier class exuding a sense of superiority that’s backed by little else other than having inherited said properties. Oh, yeah, Russians invaded Bulgaria in 1877, who can forget that unprovoked invasion… It’s a bit more complicated than that, going back to revolutionary activities prior to the war and some less than helpful Russian imperial meddling in the revolutionary organizing. That’s what empires do, but these fine “history truthers” conveniently turn blind eye to anti-Bulgarian German, Austrian, British and French meddling at that period, as it would force them to enter the realm of Realism. They prefer to inhabit the much more gratifying realm of hypocritical morality posturing on the so-called “European values,” which would be great if they were ever actually applied in practice… Old Sam Huntington and his Clash of Civilizations. The map in the linked page shows that fault line. Huntington really lost marbles with the Clash of Civilizations, IMHO. For the great powers, there is something there, although not quite for the reasons that he thinks. For the lesser powers, he’s completely off–countries like South Korea and Vietnam might belong to the same “civilization” as China, but that actually furthers the ambiguity, not lessens it (Taiwan, which is actually “Chinese” illustrates the problem better, in fact. For that matter, why is Japan of a different “civilization” from China?). The problem with Huntington’s glib thinking is that “civilization” as a political identity is a mushy concept, semi-artificially created and maintained. That countries X and Y are of the same “civilization,” or even historical affinity, doesn’t mean that they would be automatically drawn to each other without a lot of “propaganda” that people would find credible under circumstances where they are relevant. (Japanese imperial propaganda in Korea between 1910 and 1945 provide lots of examples that both work, fall flat on their face, and were the former but are officially remembered today as the latter–and these are countries with a lot of historical baggage both positive and negative, notwithstanding Huntington’s ignorance.). It goes a lot deeper than the simpleminded “civilizations.” (Unless you have discovered the Republic and Gunpowder?) “really lost marbles” is putting it midly. Sorry for being not very sophisticated but studying political science is like studying BS. And on top of that his life reads like piling even more of that cluelessness: Brzezinski, National Security Council, Trilateral Commission? The fact that he made this career and is still known sheds no good light on the intellectual culture. At.all. “That countries X and Y are of the same “civilization,” or even historical affinity, doesn’t mean that they would be automatically drawn to each other without a lot of “propaganda” that people would find credible under circumstances where they are relevant.” Exactly. I thought this would be self-evident today. But hell was I wrong. It’s been 30 years since I read Huntington and more than 50 since he read me, but I’ll undertake a partial defense. The book came out in the 90s as the Soviet Union collapsed and Fukuyama was ready to declare “game over.” Huntington steps up and says, “No, there will not be a Pax Americana or even a Pax Neoliberal. Instead, the old pattern of rivalries. along the fracture lines of language, religion and culture, will resume. One group that certainly took this seriously are the neocons, who have spent the last 30 years trying to exploit these fissures, especially in the Balkans and the Caucasus, and they’ve been pretty successful at making trouble. I know Huntington had been thinking along these lines since the mid-70s not because I had read anything of his or taken a course from him, but because he turned up as a surprise reader of my senior thesis. The subject matter was how would the arrival of lots of suburban, Republican voters in formerly Dixiecrat rural counties affect the level of political activity and participation, in other words, a mild clash of civilizations. So I think he deserves credit for having a more accurate idea of where we were headed than those who thought the end of the Cold War would end or at least greatly decrease international violence. You may be right that the “civilization” concept is mushy, and that Huntington’s analysis of the Far East is weak, but he sure seems to have gotten a lot of things right as upstater confirms with his assertion that the acrimony between Poland and the Baltics on the the one side and Russia on the other goes back to the Great Schism. Thanks for this account. I don´t want to disregard any scholar´s insight just because I do not concur with the politics behind it. But it frankly appears to me that what you did was analyze after the fact and come to a conclusion. Just what science does. Huntington on the other hand got invovled into creating a situation first which only caused the crisis. And then he was doing scholarly work about that very crisis as if it had already been in place – without any interference and assistance from his own “people” and his own ideas (“inspired” by your work in this example). I am not the expert so please forgive my superficial take: In the Arab world I often understood that, again simplified, radical Islam of the 1980s was the response to the demise of left/Communist/nationalist movements. So latter had to be destroyed first as they withstood Western imperial interests. And only when in the wake of the destruction of civil society the “healthy” fabric disintegrated would former – radical Islam – find the fertile ground and the space to take over (with a lot of help from us.) And eventually after supporting those circles of the US that had been responsible for this shift in the Middle East would Huntington come up and present his “scholarship”. It almost sounds as if he turned things upside down. (I know this is a bit exaggerated. But I hope the essence of my simple point comes across. And I assume that he probably didn´t even realize his hand in all this to some extent.) p.s. Maybe some remember the Danish caricature scandal: 20 years ago Jyllands-Posten published provocative caricatures about Muhammad. Expecting outrage. However initially there was no such reaction by the Muslim communities at all. So the editors actually sent the pictures to Muslim communities explicitly. But those again responded very relaxed and stated it didn´t really bother them. Only after these disappointing reactions did the paper force it and other papers took it up, I believe French outlets in particular. I don´t exactly remember the chronology then but I do know that almost nobody was interested in how this affair had actually started. So what happened the paper had created a scandal to sell its product. Plain and simple. And then swapped cause and effect. Oh, and nonetheless this once huge scandal has been completely forgotten. I do not believe that people hate. And elites work really really hard to bring about this hatred. And people like Huntington are part of that. In whatever twisted ways. But classic, clear-minded, honest scholarship – IMHO – never gets invovled with the politcs of the subjects it researches. Sorry for the length. The Lithuanians I actually know express opinions on the full range as regards our neighbor-to-the-west-and-east. Not ten years ago, we were the only of the three Baltics not to have an organic anti-russian movement of any significance whatsoever. The intervening decade of influence operations against us is starting to show results, sadly. Latvians and Estonians are indeed kind of psychos. Locally, and in our drinks, it is theorized the same might have become of us if we had also allowed ourselves to be colonized and ruled by the Crusader orders. That kind of influence has to leave a mark. But “Baltics” is (weirdly) an overbroad category… The “Lithuanians” cultivated for decades in the US, UK, and Canada as weapons against Teh Commiez, on the other hand? Nazis to the core. Russian invasions? Most likely the arc of Russian invasions, in an active way, moved mostly east and south. In the west was in fact a scramble between empires. I.e. Bulgarians, Romanians cannot claim of being invaded by Russians, when the fights were just on their territories btw Russians and Ottomans or Austrians, Swedes, etc… There’s a pretty fundamental difference between invasion and liberation. FWIW, growing up in the U.S. during the Cold War, I and most people I met didn’t hate the Russians/Soviets. The usual take was “They’re good people with a bad government”. When later I met some people from the Soviet Union, that was their take on the U.S. This may have just been naive why-can’t-we-all-get-along-ism but I never encountered the kind of poisonous hatred other commenters are describing. The dehumanizing rhetoric in Europe must be witnessed to be believed. What we in the US would call ‘hate speech’ is fully normalized with respect to Russia and Russians, especially in former Axis allies. It was funny when my Dad who grew up in Hungary met a US Vietnam Veteran Dad, in the US. I had to translate but both had been raised with stories about how evil the other army had been. Fun memory: “thwarting Cold War fairy-tales with a lot of beer.” Dad found it really odd that you weren´t allowed to buy booze on Sundays in the bible belt. So the first time he went to the cashier and filled the cart with the finest bottles you can imagine. Until he was denied the purchase. I had to interfere and calm him down since he caused a ruckus and cursing – fortunately – in Hungarian. Which is quite bad. But few understand it. Travelled from one end of Russia to the other in the late 90s. Folks were always friendly to Americans. “You’ve never killed us.” Many of my companions were Germans and on rare occasions bitterness toward Germany from the 1940s did come up. Just absorbing what one does in general media and education, I always thought of Lithuania as one of the three Baltic tinies. I was surprised to find out that it is a former great power. Re. “Both of these influencers…” The “precious metals” sphere has had the emergence of an AI oriental looking “presenter” giving a series of very slick programs highlighting the “doomed” nature of the metals markets as presently constituted. On the “original” metals vlogs this “character” is jokingly referred to as AI Man, and yet the information “he” presents is seriously debated. The ultimate agenda of whoever is behind AI Man is still murky at best. This highlights what is possibly the greatest danger from this AI People phenomenon, the very effective value of well made AI programing as propaganda. When everybody accepts “unreality” as the new normal… I am now waiting for the emergence of AI Politicos. We call Politicos ‘fakes’ already. What’s to stop the power elites from taking that idea to its logical extreme? Stay safe. Practice your pattern recognition skills. God forbid that this does not eventually lead to a whole bunch of AI Ben Shapiros, each tailor made to a specific audience but combined creating a political movement. My initial defense to this is to stick to Youtube channels I know. This is becoming increasingly difficult as the feed is filling up with these AI fakes. The other day, I made the mistake of clicking on what I thought was Mercouris. After a minute or so, I knew it wasn’t Alexander because there was no nose-picking and no stuttering. I’ve seen fake Wilkersons, MacGregors and lots of Mearsheimers. Usually, these fakes are making outrageous claims, discrediting these commentators to people who aren’t cautious. Crazy world. We’re getting to the point where your assumption has to be any channel created after 2026-01-01 has a >50% chance of being fake or some form of astroturf. The fake-AI Bob Barker insult comedy videos make me laugh though, lmao https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPitD1eYLiM Having the same experiences that you have had. It’s bad enough when YouTube keeps on shoving adds into those videos and you can see that the “presenter” is actually an AI. Hint – it’s hard for a human to talk and have a big smile on their face at the same time but that is how you pick an AI person. Best to stick to their official channels I guess. It seems that the real Mercouris, MacGregor, and Mearsheimer could file complaints with YouTube and report these channels. And per YT policy they should be taken down, just like YT took down channels spreading COVID “misinformation.” I won’t hold my breath, though. Especially because all of the real McCoys are engaged in truth telling that inconveniences the narrative that narrative makers want us to buy. Perhaps this is a deliberate move from the narrative makers to discredit alt-media and make it more difficult for them to get their message out. For one thing, it could easily affect traffic and revenue. Surely these commentators are aware this is happening. I’d like to hear them address how they’re trying to deal with this and the extent to which Youtube is cooperating. Mercouris has talked about doing that fair bit, but it seems that YT has not been as responsive as he’d have liked. (Although fake Mercouris seems rarer than others) I actively report such channels – at this point easy to spot, and block them from my feed. Hopefully if a large number of viewers do so, also, they will disappear (for the time being). We had friends and neighbors over for dinner during the Holidays. One of these families has a 22 year old young man who is quite frankly movie star handsome and is very bright. There were other kids his age here at the same time. It came up in conversation that ANY and ALL texts, emails, etc he receives with any possible dating partner are sent through AI services to a) have a full profile of the possible partner’s mental health and motivations and b) to assess their compatibility with him. Again, in my day, this would not have been a young man who would have had any problems attracting women and furthermore all of the above issues he is sending to AI would have been talked out with his closest friends. Now we ditch the friends, the locker rooms, the bar, the basketball court and hand everything over to Grok or chat GPT. What really concerned me is that every person in my house between 18-30 or so that evening informed us all that they do exactly the same thing. AI screening of all potential dates, partners, etc. This was new to me and I could scarcely believe what I was hearing. We are removing humanity from every single interaction we have. I fear for these kids when they are 50. But the other very concerning issue is that all texts, emails, any correspondence at all that has our individual names, email addresses, phone numbers, whatever are being sent to AI companies to be analyzed. And we have zero idea this is even being done. You can avoid it all you want in your life, but it is becoming increasingly clear that AI has no intention at all of avoiding you. Please, anyone, help me find a bright spot here. Do you think this is a truly representative experience for the US or rather fringe? Bright spot? Not bright: But maybe things happening later in their lives which will render this new way of connecting less attractive. Life has a way of messing things up, doesn´t it? As they say in German: “Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt”/”Man proposes, God disposes.” (I assume the idea of a “ghost in the machine” too is related to the chaos-oriented hope that not all can be planned and manipulated incessently in an AI-controlled society.) Sometimes you have to dodge people walking down the street who are staring at their phones. Re Doc’s tale presumably any kid who is off the electronic grid never gets a date–the new definition of a wallflower. Filmmaker John Hughes would have made much of this. Ned Ludd would not have been on any social media. The “moderne” habits of social media use are quite understandable if viewed through the lens of conformism as a social organizing strategy. Being in the world but not of it is very hard. I try and generally fail in that endeavour. However, I continue trying. The main point about any of the so called AIs we encounter is that they are simple tools for others. A computer program has no agency. As the Late Lamented Lambert remarked, code is law. Learn who or what lies behind an AI and you are half way to mastering said AI. As for the use of AIs in general; I have noticed that many people are prone to searching out the “easy way” to accomplish difficult tasks. Thinking is hard. It takes will power to ‘buckle down’ and do the hard work when a supposedly “easy” fix is available. I too fear for the younger cohorts. They will eventually encounter problems that AIs cannot fix for them. Then the lack of skills and training will cripple them in the face of their problems. I fear I am becoming trite, but this is nothing really new. The problems of laziness and lack of skill acquisition are perennial. Today, with the “help” of high tech, those problems have become automated, at scale. As the “adults” in the room, so to speak, our task is the difficult one of finding those of the younger cohorts who can be helped and are willing to try. We are now entering a period of Social Triage. Stay safe, strong and resilient. A friend who has a Gen Z co-worker reported the following… Gen Z co-worker wanted to use ChatGPT to resolve a customer issue. Friend: “no, we shouldn’t do that.” Co-worker admitted to probably relying on ChatGT too much, but at least wasn’t as bad as co-worker’s partner, who evidently wears ear buds and has an AI app listen to all conversations with other humans. In conversation with others, this person just waits, listens to the earbuds to be told what to say by the AI, and then responds. So…. You ready to do a Butlerian Jihad now, Doc? 😉 3 tomahawks failed to explode out of 12? That’s pretty bad pic.twitter.com/OivQCQ70DD — Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) December 27, 2025 Who’s cleaning the mess up? Are those only going to lay there to be photographed? And another speculation crossed my mind that may be wild to mention. Those two lying on flat ground have been put there gently, so someone is already doing some cleaning. I don’t what is worse: Lord Bebo passing off AI slop as real or people on this site falling for it. We were overdue for a feral hog story. Excellent timing! For a shorter summary of the Epstein history, see the Doug Ross item. Thank you for the link which I have bookmarked. I am three hours through the four hour Mike Benz broadcast that was in today’s links. Except for an explanation of Epstein’s entre into Bear Stearns, that link can be skipped up to about the 50 minute part (Yadda-yadda). As this outline suggests, Benz highlights many points at which Epstein’s life intersects with some very interesting characters involved in some very significant “deep history” events. At minimum he provides reasons to take the Epstein case seriously rather than write it off as simply the sensationalized actions of a “lone pervert” or (as with the NY Times) just a con-man ripping off poor unsuspecting billionaires. A lot of this is being covered in the on-going work of Ryan Grim and Drop Site News. And almost all of it has been covered earlier by Whitney Webb, who continues to be ignored by the mainstream press but also gets shafted by a lot of the alt media. I’ve been very cautious about Benz. He was a sketchy anonymous right-wing “influencer” before he suddenly exploded all over the internet as a former State Department employee and supposed intelligence expert. But much of what he says does ring true and correspond with other sources. That link is great. Also confirms my priors. I had long thought and sometimes said that Epstein was most likely an arms dealer. That is hugely lucrative. Looks like he was broadly involved in that nexus. On the name change to the Trump-Kennedy Center, it’s worth noting that the original name is The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center. A “Memorial” refers to how a society honors someone who is already dead. I doubt Trump realizes adding his name makes no sense. Second, Trump is not adding his name or building monuments to himself because he has a big ego. Rather, he knows deep down how incompetent and weak he truly is. And he spends enormous energy hiding that fact. For this reason, he realizes that when he dies nobody is going to build anything in honor to him. Or he’s just messing with people. It used to be hard to guess which part of Trump was shtick. Nowadays he seems genuinely gaga. A headstone?

Becoming a billionaire rarely involves doing what’s right. Forgive me for asking again but what are the best alternatives for using YT? I have no YT account but some channels like Pascal Lottaz are only on YT and sometimes I can´t click away the ads since I am not at my desk which makes it in part impossible to listen. So I stopped watching. There were ad-free YT-alternatives but those disappeared and the most recent comments about the existing YT alternatives mentioned on NC recently I forgot to bookmark. I can´t click away the ads since I am not at my desk which makes it in part impossible to listen. A wireless mouse could be one solution? I download everything I want to watch. Then watch at my own leisure, including fast forwarding and rewinding. No ads. Works on 90% of stuff out there. Then, delete to free the disk space. How do you download things? I had WonderShare for years but the algorithm changes and now I need to upgrade. Which I haven’t been able to do. media-downloader https://github.com/mhogomchungu/media-downloader I use Any Video Converter Ultimate. Free download. You just have to get a slightly older version, some 2-3 years old. Works with w10 and w11. Video Download Helper extension on Firefox works well but those more savvy than me can discuss whether the permissions make it a spybot. Firefox does offer tracking protections that may block. I never use Chrome or Safari. If you want to watch YouTube on your phone, I have heard good things about Newpipe, though I haven’t tried it myself yet. If you want an alternative site, some youtubers cross-post to Rumble, so depending on what channels you want to watch, they may already be there. Rumble is newer, so not as enshittifide yet. I use Newpipe on Android with excellent results. No ads. Download features available On desktop I use Firefox browser with the YouTube ad block extension. Also works excellently. Can’t download, but no ads. It also works with a YT account without issues. Both the above work without a YT account. If i am understanding the problem correctly. You can use the FireFox browser to watch programs like “Neutrality Studies” ad free once you install an ad blocker like “ublock Orgin” . Setting -> Extentions and Themes Then search ublock under addons Brave browser blocks utube ads by default and allows background play on android. I’m a hard-core IT nerd so I use a technique not available to most: I use the ‘yt-dlp’ program to download videos, mostly from video-game playthroughs, and watch those on a flash drive plugged into my TV. I also download long music videos for video game soundtracks, turn those into MP3 files, and play them on my phone. As part of the soundtrack project I use a program that I wrote 30 years ago and made open-source. So… not a normal responder. Youtube has lately been playing ‘arms race’ with the downloader apps, and I don’t know if they still work. Cheers, and good luck! As a medium-hardness-core IT nerd, I use 9xbuddy.com, savefrom.net, and invidio.us. The first one works on bunch of sites. FreeTube app. All ads defeated. Excellent. Thanks for the help to everyone!!! I guess I figure out the best solution. And I will bookmark this now. I don’t have a YT account so I do not understand your issue. And I watch a LOT of YT. If you use the Orion browser, it blocks YT ads. But sometime the video freezes as a result of the ad blocking and you have to restart (but it will resume where it stopped).

The group of monks has recently entered LaGrange, Georgia. Their website has a daily map, and their Facebook page has a live map. Local news stations along the path have had stories of the monks. “Photos show California slammed with heavy rain, mudslides from storm” Between the floods, the fires and the earthquakes, you sometimes wonder if California hates people and is trying to kill them off. Nah, since half the state doesn’t have seasons, earthquakes, fires, floods, and riots become our seasons.

For example, they dug up a two-story-high wooden wheel that they used to do construction work. We had no idea! Also, the wine shops had murals that look exactly like 1970s Napa wine country graphic design.

Lol the so called left would never even consider withholding voters It began when Cuban American lawmakers pressed Mr. Trump early this year to end Chevron’s Biden-era confidential license. After Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio announced in late February that they would do so, Mr. Maduro stopped accepting deportation flights of Venezuelans. Mr. Maduro had agreed to them on Jan. 31 with Richard Grenell, a special envoy for Mr. Trump. Chevron’s chief executive, Mike Wirth, lobbied the administration for a license extension, speaking to Mr. Trump several times over the coming months. The Cuban American lawmakers got wind that the license could be extended, and they threatened to withhold their votes for Mr. Trump’s signature legislation, “the One Big Beautiful Bill.” At the Oval Office meeting in late May, Mr. Trump told Mr. Rubio and Mr. Miller that he needed to get the bill passed. But he said he had heard about the downsides of ending the license, including that Chinese companies would take over Chevron’s stakes, said an official. The president demanded options. That was when Mr. Miller offered to help. He had been nurturing his ideas for mass deportations and boat strikes. Mr. Trump did not renew Chevron’s license when it expired on May 27. His domestic policy bill passed Congress five weeks later. https://archive.ph/pnWpI How Oil, Drugs and Immigration Fueled Trump’s Venezuela Campaign re: Zionism as cult 10 min. with Katie Halper and Russell Dobular https://scheerpost.com/2025/12/27/zionism-scientology-and-the-cult-mentality-no-one-talks-about/ This story from the London Times, Sunday edition in 2023 sheds some new light for me on what’s happened to the UK Labour Party and the rise of Starmer.

Asset management giant BlackRock says one powerhouse sector of the market is going strong heading into 2026. In a new report, BlackRock says the next year will be defined by artificial intelligence (AI), which the firm says is growing at an unprecedented rate and will help push the US stock market to heights it has never seen before. “We’ve long argued we’re in a world of structural transformation shaped by a few mega forces, including geopolitical fragmentation, the future of finance and the energy transition. But the most obvious now is AI, with a buildout of a potentially unprecedented speed and scale. This shift to capital-intensive growth from capital-light is profoundly changing the investment environment and pushing limits on multiple fronts – physical, financial and socio-political. A few big macro drivers implies a few big market drivers. Today’s market concentration reflects underlying economic concentration. That means investors can’t avoid making big calls, in our view. AI is the dominant mega force right now, helping propel U.S. stocks to all-time highs this year… We stay overweight U.S. stocks and the AI theme, supported by robust earnings expectations. The capex (capital expenditure) may pay off overall even if not for individual companies. The next phase may be more about energy and resolving bottlenecks.” However, BlackRock notes that AI does face challenges, such as its extremely high rate of energy consumption. “AI data centers could use 15-20% of current U.S. electricity demand by 2030 – a scale sure to test the limits of power grid, fossil and materials industries… Some estimates even suggest data centers could use a quarter of current electricity demand. Rising power demand collides with a backlog of projects waiting to connect with the electric grid and generally slow permitting in the West. Capex plans could be walked back if such limits bite, crimping ambition around the AI buildout.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Farrell and McCracken: colossal impact of Irish football legends still felt today

Time Published: 2025-12-27T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Early on in The Emerald Evertonian, a new book about the life and times of Peter Farrell, comes a remarkable detail revealing something of the status of soccer in 1930s Ireland. The young Farrell had just joined Cabinteely United, then run by an enthusiast called Christy Devlin. “The team’s ‘pavilion’,” writes author Rob Sawyer, “was a huge tree . . .” The tree was behind one goalmouth and under its branches, the players changed and deposited any valuables a 13 year-old from south Dublin might possess. Farrell saw the difference when he played Gaelic football “on much better grounds than our soccer one at Cabinteely”. He added: “We also had a well-equipped pavilion with showers at our school sports ground at Dún Laoghaire.” But Farrell was inspired, not dismayed. Even though Devlin earned little as a gravedigger, he and his wife would feed “several” boys before matches. Farrell took it all in. Early on in The Offside King, a new book about the life and times of Bill McCracken, comes his verdict on arriving at Newcastle train station at 3am, having just been transferred from Distillery. He was be met by three Newcastle United directors in “old-fashioned frock coats... I c...uldn’t help saying to myself ‘Begarra – they look more like undertakers’.” McCracken was dismayed, not inspired. But he endured his first unhappy months at St James’ Park and went on to become “a true legend of the game“, in the words of author Paul Joannou. Irish football, gravediggers and undertakers, there’s a joke in there. Farrell, from Dublin, and McCracken, from Belfast, were serious men, though. They were rich with connections great and small and these two books help build out our knowledge of who and what Irish football was and how we are where we are. This is social history as well as the charting of two fascinating football lives. Peter Farrell, for example, married Mabel Carney, whose aunt Winnie was the Winifred Carney alongside James Connolly at the GPO in 1916. The scent of independence may also have been in Farrell’s nostrils when he played in the first Ireland (FAI) international after the second World War. It was June, 1946, in Lisbon against Portugal and Farrell was made captain, even though it was his debut. That must have been some moment. Afterwards, back in Dublin at a ceremony at the Gresham hotel, he was presented with this first cap. Rather than hold on to it, maybe frame it, Farrell instead gave it to his guest at the Gresham – Christy Devlin. The big tree at Cabinteely had not been forgotten. Untold numbers of Irish soccer volunteers – and those who benefited – will recognise this reciprocal commitment and affection. In the 1910 FA Cup final replay, held at Goodison Park, McCracken was part of a Newcastle United side winning the trophy for the first time. McCracken was the penalty-taker and at 1-0 up, Newcastle were awarded one. But McCracken knew centre forward Albert Shepherd had been the subject of bribery gossip before the semi-final and was not selected. Shepherd was reinstated for the final and scored the opening goal. As McCracken passed him for the penalty, he said to Shepherd: “Fancy it? Go on, take it.” McCracken’s motivation was “to get him re-established”. Shepherd scored and entered the history books as the first player ever to score a penalty in an FA Cup final. Really, it should be McCracken. Thirty-nine years later there was another penalty in a 2-0 win at Goodison. It was England v Ireland (FAI) and Con Martin scored the spot-kick. Farrell scored the second as Ireland became the first “foreign” nation to beat England on English soil. Farrell was an Everton player by then, winning the 10th of 28 caps. He had passed through Shamrock Rovers, under the supervision of Jimmy Dunne, and won a tennis tournament in Blackrock. A dual international, he made the last of his seven Ireland (IFA) appearances six months earlier. McCracken played for Ireland (IFA), but only 16 times due to a row over pay. The blazers in Belfast barred him from selection for 11 years. Bureaucrats and Irish football. This was when McCracken was at his peak, but in asking for equal pay with English and Scottish internationals, he was deemed a troublemaker. The IFA ban extended to Irish League clubs and given there was no Border then, McCracken was effectively banned from setting foot on an a pitch anywhere in Ireland. Simultaneously, he was becoming the most talked-about footballer in England. Working in a Tyneside munitions factory during the first World War, McCracken was known for his prominent role in fundraising friendlies. It was a bit different from his reputation as a defender – ‘The Most Hated Man in Football’ was one headline. That attitude stemmed from his offside capabilities. McCracken was so efficient at offside that ‘McCrackenism’ became a term. In 1925, Law 6 of the game was changed from having three players between an attacker and goal to be onside, to two. The man from Nansen Street off the Falls Road changed the geometry of football forever. McCracken played 432 times for Newcastle United – Shay Given is one of only four players to have more appearances. Farrell played 452 times for Everton – only four men have made more league appearances for the club. Both went into management after playing, McCracken with Hull City, Gateshead, Millwall and Aldershot, Farrell with Tranmere Rovers, where his great friend and Evertonian Tommy Eglington played. Success, and failure, for both men is seen in context – neither were managing clubs with big budgets. McCracken returned to the Irish League as a Newcastle scout to sign George Eastham from Ards, then as a Watford scout to sign Pat Jennings from Newry Town. Farrell went briefly to the League of Ireland, playing three games for Sligo Rovers. It means he, Dixie Dean and Séamus Coleman, who writes the book’s foreword, are three men to have played for Everton and Sligo. Farrell went back to Britain – to Holyhead Town in Wales – then returned to Ireland for good. He managed Drogheda United briefly, then St Pat’s and TEK United. There he came to know another Devlin – Pat. Like all who came into contact with Farrell, Pat Devlin says he felt honoured to know the man. Lest anyone think this esteem is exaggerated, walk down Farrell Close in Kirkby in Liverpool, the street named after him. McCracken has less formal recognition, although his central role in changing a key law of the game will be reasserted by The Offside King, just as The Emerald Evertonian illustrates the significance of Peter Farrell. Two compelling men. Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Groq continues innovation after raisingÂ $750M (September 2025) at a $9B valuation. Nvidia solidifies dominance amid competition fromÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google TPUs. In a move that further solidifies its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, Nvidia has secured a non-exclusive licensing agreement with AI chip startup Groq, bringing aboard its founder, CEO Jonathan Ross, and key executives to bolster its inference technology capabilities. The deal, announced by Groq on Wednesday, Dec. 24, allows Nvidia to license Groq's proprietary AI inference technology while hiring Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other senior engineers. Groq will continue operating independently under new CEO Simon Edwards, with its cloud platform, GroqCloud, remaining unaffected. Groq, founded in 2016 by former Google engineers, specializes in AI inferenceâthe process of running trained AI models to generate predictions or responses, such as those seen in ChatGPT or image recognition systems. The company developed its customÂ Language Processing Unit (LPU), designed for high-speed, low-cost AI inference. "AI inference, in the context of artificial intelligence, refers to the process by which AI models draw conclusions or make predictions based on input data. This process is a fundamental aspect of AI, enabling machines to learn, reason and make decisions," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. AI inference can be categorized into two primary types: inductive and deductive inference. A third one, probabilistic inference, involves making decisions or drawing conclusions based on probabilities and statistical models. This type of inference is commonly used in Bayesian AI networks and Deep Learning models. Nvidia, already the leader in AI training chips, is now doubling down on inferenceâa critical next phase as AI shifts from development to real-world deployment. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal in an internal email obtained by CNBC: "We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A new trend: Talent-focused deals The agreement follows a growing Silicon Valley trend where tech giants acquire key talent rather than entire companiesâa strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles while securing top-tier expertise. Recent examples include: Microsoft'sÂ deal withÂ Inflection AI, bringing co-founder Mustafa Suleyman onboard. Google'sÂ $2.5 billion licensing agreement withÂ Character.AI, hiring only select employees. Meta'sÂ $14 billion investment inÂ Scale AI, absorbing its CEO to lead AI initiatives. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive (a major Groq investor), confirmed to CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assetsânot the entire companyâfor an estimatedÂ $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest deal ever. Geopolitical implications: U.S. AI leadership The deal aligns with President Donald Trump'sÂ July executive orderÂ promoting the export of U.S. AI technology to maintain global dominance. Groq has been a key player in this initiative, powering AI infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies and overÂ 2 million developers worldwide. "Inference is defining this era of AI, and we're building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost," Ross stated in September. While Nvidia strengthens its AI ecosystem, Groq will continue innovating under new leadership. The startup had previously raisedÂ $750 million in September at a $6.9 billion valuation, with investors includingÂ BlackRock, Samsung and Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital. As AI transitions from lab development to global deployment, Nvidia's latest move ensures it remains at the forefrontâboth in trainingÂ andÂ inference. With competitors likeÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google's TPUsÂ vying for market share, the AI chip wars are far from over.

This process is a fundamental aspect of AI, enabling machines to learn, reason and make decisions," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. AI inference can be categorized into two primary types: inductive and deductive inference. A third one, probabilistic inference, involves making decisions or drawing conclusions based on probabilities and statistical models. This type of inference is commonly used in Bayesian AI networks and Deep Learning models. Nvidia, already the leader in AI training chips, is now doubling down on inferenceâa critical next phase as AI shifts from development to real-world deployment. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal in an internal email obtained by CNBC: "We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A new trend: Talent-focused deals The agreement follows a growing Silicon Valley trend where tech giants acquire key talent rather than entire companiesâa strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles while securing top-tier expertise. Recent examples include: Microsoft'sÂ deal withÂ Inflection AI, bringing co-founder Mustafa Suleyman onboard. Google'sÂ $2.5 billion licensing agreement withÂ Character.AI, hiring only select employees. Meta'sÂ $14 billion investment inÂ Scale AI, absorbing its CEO to lead AI initiatives. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive (a major Groq investor), confirmed to CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assetsânot the entire companyâfor an estimatedÂ $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest deal ever. Geopolitical implications: U.S. AI leadership The deal aligns with President Donald Trump'sÂ July executive orderÂ promoting the export of U.S. AI technology to maintain global dominance. Groq has been a key player in this initiative, powering AI infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies and overÂ 2 million developers worldwide. "Inference is defining this era of AI, and we're building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost," Ross stated in September. While Nvidia strengthens its AI ecosystem, Groq will continue innovating under new leadership. The startup had previously raisedÂ $750 million in September at a $6.9 billion valuation, with investors includingÂ BlackRock, Samsung and Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital. As AI transitions from lab development to global deployment, Nvidia's latest move ensures it remains at the forefrontâboth in trainingÂ andÂ inference. With competitors likeÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google's TPUsÂ vying for market share, the AI chip wars are far from over. For now, Nvidia's strategic talent grab reinforces its position as the undisputed leader in the AI revolution.

Features The Editors | December 23, 2025 We both know the history of superlatives creates a flattened, reductive interpretation of our world. But they're also the quickest way to label a praise for those recommendations we give in order to connect with one another, and isn't that why we're here? To find something in common, to stave off the loneliness for another hour? Should you have any additions, questions, or qualms: treat yourself by commenting below. We'll be seeing you in 2026. — The Editors (Click on a name to jump to their selections) Jean Marc Ah-Sen Robert Aman Tiffany Babb Jason Bergman Colin Blanchette Kevin Brown Clark Burscough RJ Casey Henry Chamberlain Helen Chazan Michael Dooley Alex Dueben Malcy Duff Austin English Jim Falcone Andrew Farago Shaenon K. Garrity Nicole Georges Corinne Halbert Charles Hatfield Tim Hayes Bart Hulley Christopher Irving John Kelly Hank Kennedy Christina Lee Chris Mautner Sean McCarthy Tate McFadden Daniel Meyerowitz Claire Napier Brian Nicholson Isaac Odai Hagai Palevsky Leonard Pierce Richard Pound Zach Rabiroff Oliver Ristau Cynthia Rose Tom Shapira J. Webster Sharp Valerio Stivè Marc Tessier *** (articles) (top) My favorite comic releases and reissues of the year, in no particular order: *** (articles) (top) Although I firmly believe that the best comics are being produced right now — works that will only be surpassed by those yet to come— I can’t help feeling, when asked to sum up the year, that noticeably fewer comics have seen the light of day compared with last year. This impression is entirely subjective; I have no empirical data to support it. Still, it may not be wholly unreasonable given the dark clouds gathering over the comics landscape: rising tariffs, increasing production costs, Diamond’s bankruptcy, to name just a few possible factors. And if that weren’t enough, several publishers have reported serious financial losses, among them France’s L’Association, which has publicly appealed to its readers for support in order to survive. That said, the year has also delivered a number of truly outstanding works, which I have done my best to rank in the list below. An undisputed number one is Swiss cartoonist Nando von Arb’s Bouquet de peurs. This brick of an autobiographical work, dealing with von Arb’s mental illness, manages to fuse influences from Frida Kahlo, Brecht Evens, and illustrations reminiscent of Czech children’s books from the 1970s in a wholly unique way. Although mental illness is far from a new subject in comics, Bouquet de peurs is the most compelling work on the topic since David B.’s portrayal of his brother’s epilepsy from the 1990s. Anders Nilsen’s Tongues may contain one plot element too many, but few cartoonists can juggle Greek mythology, a talking chicken, soldiers, an American hitchhiker, and more with the same finesse as Nilsen. The result is a stunning reading experience, driven by powerful and often haunting imagery. Moa Romanova’s second book in English, Buff Soul, can be read as a graphic travel diary, drawing on a long tradition of documenting life on tour. Romanova follows her friend ShitKid to a music festival in Texas, and while the book includes genre-typical elements — such as the rebellious and often self-destructive tendencies of the rock music scene — its greatest strength lies in its sensitive portrayal of genuine friendship. When Jean-Christophe Menu, together with Étienne Robial, decided to revive the legendary 30/40 series, Menu was the first to contribute a volume of his own. Expectations were high, and he had no trouble living up to them. The comics dealing with his parents’ deaths rank among the finest work he has ever produced — and, by extension, among the strongest examples of autobiographical comics as a genre. World Within the World, Julie Gfrörer’s collection of short stories revisits her familiar uncanny version of our world, one filled with desire, despair, and the universal need for connection. For all their macabre qualities, the dark corners Gfrörer explores are also very funny. In sixth place, I’ve put Ville Ranta, who seems incapable of making a bad book. For over twenty years, Ranta has chronicled his life in comics. His latest work revisits the period when he was active at a Finnish cultural magazine, where he, among other things, published a comic that satirically commented on the Finnish political leadership’s response to the Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark—a topic he discussed in an interview with The Comics Journal. In Les buveurs de vin, the reader follows both the events themselves and their aftermath, interspersed with prodigious amounts of drinking. That Ranta remains untranslated into English becomes more baffling with every new book. New York Review Comics deserves special praise for finally translating into English another book by Yvan Alagbé, co-founder of Amok and one of the most influential publishers of the French alternative comics scene of the 1990s. The book continues Alagbé’s sustained exploration of race and colonialism in contemporary France. A younger — but equally prodigious — storyteller is Cameron Arthur, whose fanzine Swag has been a joy to follow. Stories from its early issues have now been collected into a single volume. With cartoonists like Arthur, the future of comics looks bright. *** (articles) (top) *** (articles) (top) The vast majority of my comics reading in 2025 was research for interviews on this site. Of those, I have to mention Anders Nilsen's Tongues, and the truly surprising return of Jeff Nicholson's Colonia as particularly noteworthy new books. Otherwise most of the new comics I read this year were ... fine, I guess? Not a whole lot came to mind when I sat down to look back on the year. We did get a new Love & Rockets collection from Jaime Hernandez (Life Drawing), which was excellent as always, and I also very much enjoyed Santos Sisters vol. 1 by Greg & Fake. But a lot of other books were just forgettable, if not downright disappointing. With one surprising exception, The Solitary Gourmet. There's a local Japanese restaurant my family eats at regularly, and they always play the television series based on this manga on their screens. Without subtitles, of course, forcing us to try to guess what's going on. I had dubbed the series "Inspector Food" because it looked like a show about a detective, only one where all he does is eat. I wasn't too far off, I suppose — he's not a cop, just a salesman. But anyway, the manga by Jirō Taniguchi and Masayuki Kusumi is wonderful. As noted by Joe McCulloch in his review, the book is best enjoyed in small bites, something I appreciate. It's small, it's quiet, there's no major drama to be found, it's beautifully illustrated, and it's all about food. Maybe I'm having flashbacks to all the time I spent wandering Tokyo by myself, or maybe it says something about my state of mind, but this weird book about a man eating food by himself is my favorite graphic novel of 2025. *** (articles) (top) 1) Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles Zine Publications) I passed up the opportunity to buy this book a few times before I pulled the trigger, and even then, I only bought it because of the high quality of Bubble’s other publications (Stories from Zoo by Anand was a revelation), not because the book looked that interesting at first glance. I was wrong. It’s a fantastic book of short stories, and it’s the book that I’ve thought about the most since I first read it. I hope that we see a lot more work from Cameron Arthur. 2) Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) I was shocked when I heard that Crumb had a new comic book coming, hot on the heels of Dan Nadel’s wonderful biography. It was a pleasant shock, even though I was prepared for it to be forgettable work by a once great artist. Luckily for me (and everyone else, except his haters), he’s still a great artist, and he can still draw like a motherfucker. Even though he’s wrong about almost everything, Crumb communicates his beliefs clearly and effectively. This comic is by far the best value of the year as well. It’s a dense, satisfying read, and it’s re-readable as well. It delivers more than most graphic novels with ten times the page count. 3) Tongues Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) If you’ve been reading Tongues in its serialized form, then you’re probably aware that it’s a very good comic, but reading the existing story in one go is a different matter entirely. There’s still another big book coming to finish this story off, but I think it’s safe to say at this point that it’s Nilsen’s best book so far. Considering the fact that his previous work has ranged from good to excellent, that’s no mean feat. This book is the summation of his work as a cartoonist, and it’s thrilling to witness a great cartoonist at the peak of his powers dive headlong into his own preoccupations in such a considered and mature way. 4) Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) I knew nothing about this book or its creator before I read it. I flipped through it and looked good. When you take the time to actually look at it, though, you realize just how good it looks. The sheer craft on display is mesmerizing. Torices utilizes every kind of form and mode that he can think of to tell the story of a hapless loser meandering through his pathetic life who fails to aid one of the few people that’s ever been kind to him. The story is simple and it’s not as funny as it thinks it is, but I’ll admit I was impressed by the audacity of the storytelling, and the book overall. 5) King-Cat Comics and Stories #84 by John Porcellino (self-published) At this point, King-Cat is like the tides. It’s a natural force that seems inevitable, and you know the form will be familiar. The content is never the same, even if the preoccupations are. Love, death, music, groundhog sightings … they’re all here, as usual. At this point, Porcellino is an institution, of a kind; and like a lot of institutions, he’s taken for granted. He shouldn’t be. I’m grateful for each new issue of King-Cat and I hope he makes them for years to come. 6) The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Measured against Joe Sacco’s other books, this is a fairly minor work. Of course, a minor work by Sacco is better than most cartoonists could ever hope for. India is vast, both in terms of its geography and its history, and this relatively thin book only scraped the surface of the corruption, sectarianism, and bloodletting that has plagued the country’s modern history. The book is beautifully drawn and Sacco packs a lot into these pages, but for the first time when reading one of his books I felt like maybe he had bitten off more than he could chew. As always, I’m glad he took the bite, especially since no one else seems likely to follow in his footsteps and make harrowing books like he has, over and over again. 7) Love Languages by James Albon (Top Shelf Productions) Each of Albon’s books is different from the last. I’ve liked all of them. This book walked a tightrope, though instead of falling into the abyss, the danger was that it would fall into cloying sentimentality. That’s not a fate worse than death, mind you, but when the story is a romance that risk is high to begin with. The romance in this story is well-earned, even if it isn’t revelatory. Albon’s storytelling is, however. I’ve never seen a comic handle multiple spoken languages as skillfully as he does here, blending English, French, and Mandarin together, artfully. It’s a beautiful comic by an underrated cartoonist. 8) The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) I don’t know what I expected this book to be, but it was different than whatever I expected. I knew that the drawing would be great, and it is. There are times when you come across a page that’s so unbelievably gorgeous it just stops you in your tracks. Tyler’s exploration of her grief, and grief in general, gets exhausting after a while, but I think that’s the point. Over the course of 200+ dense, lushly illustrated pages she digs into one of the hardest experiences life has to offer, and from that pain she creates beauty. It’s a book that will sit with you. 9) Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) Richard Sala has been one of my favorite cartoonists for a very, very long time. This book, originally printed in a magazine format forty years ago, has eluded me, so imagine my surprise, and pleasure, when I heard that it was being printed in a luxurious hardcover edition. This early work is a lot of fun. All of Sala’s work was fun, though the way it was fun varied greatly over the years. For anyone who fondly remembers his Invisible Hands segments from MTV’s Liquid Television, I would imagine they would enjoy this work. For me, it was the missing piece of a puzzle I’ve been putting together for a few decades and, happily, a wonderful comic from beloved cartoonist. 10) Ginseng Roots: A Memoir by Craig Thompson (Pantheon) What this book is, is impressive. Making a book this long is impressive (440+ pages) but it’s not uncommon nowadays. What is uncommon is how much cartooning went into every single page. Thompson lavishes those pages with a lot of ink, and a lot of stories, too. It’s subtitled “A Memoir” and it is one, but it also delves into the history of his family, his community, ginseng farming (in China and North America), and where they all are at today. The ambition of this book impressed me, and it delivered on that ambition. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman Vol. 1: The Zoo by Scott Snyder, Nick Dragotta, and Frank Martin DC’s Absolute series reimagines well-known heroes without their well-known back stories. This Bruce Wayne grows up lower- to middle-class, so he lacks the financial resources of the traditional story, leaving him to rely even more on his mental abilities. Gotham is the same place, though, overrun by crime bosses and a group called the Party Animals who seek to sow chaos. The strongest part of this work is that the focus remains solely on Batman’s desire to do good in the world, to seek justice for everybody, which has always been at his core. You Must Take Part in Revolution by Badiucao and Melissa Chan Badiucao and Chan don’t provide a neat ending to their work, as there aren’t easy answers for how and when one should act against a tyrannical government. However, they’re clear that inaction isn’t a viable option. Spent by Alison Bechdel It seems obvious to mention Alison Bechdel when talking about great work from the year, but she’s taken a bit of a risk here by returning to fiction after her past three memoirs. While she certainly focuses on friends and community, as she did in Dykes to Watch Out For, her exploration of how we spend our time or money or energy seems particularly relevant today. She even ends with a brief glimmer of hope in community, something we could certainly use right now. Muybridge by Guy Delisle Delisle goes well beyond Muybridge’s famous photograph of a horse to create the world of invention that he was a part of. Most interestingly, Delisle shows Muybridge’s influence on animation, motion pictures, and graphic works like Delisle’s, an influence that continues well beyond what Muybridge could imagine. Absolute Wonder Woman, vol. 1: The Last Amazon by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Mattia de Iulis, and Dustin Nguyen Here, Diana doesn’t grow up on Themyscira. Instead, she’s raised in the underworld. Rather than preventing her from caring about and fighting for humanity, that banishment simply gave her more weapons to fight for justice. Nightwing: On with the Show by Dan Watters, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Wes Abbott Dan Watters and team take on the challenge of picking up Nightwing’s story after the amazing run led by Tom Taylor. They draw on Nightwing’s past experiences with the circus and his early days with Batman, while throwing him in the middle of a gang war that has begun after Blockbuster’s death in the earlier series. *** (articles) (top) Well, I don’t know about you, but 2025 sure had a lot of “Lemon, it’s Wednesday” vibes to it for me, so, much like last year, a list compiled in a bedraggled state, running to the lecture hall with a slice of toast in my mouth, but a list nonetheless, from your friendly neighbourhood linkblogger. While the lion’s share of the pop culture outlet coverage seemed to go to the title with the steroidally embiggened versions of Gotham’s denizens, for this regular-sized reader the most interesting of DC Comics’ Absolute line have absolutely been Absolute Wonder Woman by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, et al. and Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodriguez, et al., the first volumes for both of which mess with their respective mythoi in interestingly spiky ways, and don’t mind assuming that the reader will be able to keep pace and catch up when dropped in media res, and both of which also have some of the most pleasingly arresting visuals I’ve seen in a superhero comic for a while. Now, as long as they don’t tank the ongoing supracontinuity fun with plodding crossover events that kill an entire line’s momentum, we’ll be laughing. Taking the coveted top spot for comic that made me say “oh, mate, brutal” out loud the most times while reading it this year, we have The Sickness, Volume 1 by Lonnie Nadler, Jenna Cha, et al., the timeline hopping nastiness of which put me in mind of the creeping descent into madness and unmooring from reality as depicted in Providence by Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows. The slow burn reveals and peeling back of the consistently unnerving story playing out in the first collected volume for the series has left me strongly anticipating that volume two will also be a future best-of contender. Cleansing the palate after the nastiness [complimentary] of the last pick, comes the warmhearted delights of Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank, which was yet another annual pick cribbed from Sally Madden and Katie Skelly’s aces Thick Lines podcast, and which was a much needed dose of a slice-of-life strip that’s just consistently Really Nice and Properly Funny. The closing narrative coda, returning to best friend protagonists Miss Ruki and Ecchan ten years down the line, is genuinely lovely. As a classic dyed-in-the-wool trade-waiter, I was very glad to see The Santos Sisters by Greg & Fake receive a winningly handsome collected edition (peep that see-thru acetate dust jacket and thick paper stock) this year, which serves well the nod and a wink punchlines to dirty jokes with clean lines to be found within. This book sings as this year’s shining example that, sometimes, like Dandadan in last year's list, all you really need, to pep you up during a grim period in history, is a comic that’s horny and weird and fun and good to look at in equal measure. *** (articles) (top) Alive Outside, ed. by Cullen Beckhorn and Marc Bell (Neoglyphic Media).

Thank you to all the artists listed below. (If I have written about any of these books in my “Arrivals and Departures” column this year, I will include a link.) Honorable Mentions (in no order): Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy Tedward by Josh Pettinger Prop Comic by Veronica Graham Animal Denial by Emilie Gleason K is in Trouble Again by Gary Clement Them Shaped Clouds by Max Huffman The Shifting Ground Vol. 1 by Joe Walsh Laser Eye Surgery by Walker Tate The Past is a Grotesque Animal by Tommi Parrish Slick Susan and the Mysterious Soup by Rebecca Kirby The Weight by Melissa Mendes “Kristof” by Alex Schubert Igor the Assistant by Haus of Decline Top 10 of 2025 (in order!): 10.) Allee Errico’s pages in Bernadette #2 9.) Pleasure Beach #1 by Josh Pettinger 8.) Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan 7.) Flea by Mara Ramirez 6.) Christine by Cyril Vilks 5.) Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang 4.) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. 3.) Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers 2.) Dogtangle by Max Huffman 1.) River Rangers #8 by Henry McCausland *** (articles) (top) We began 2025 with a big event title, the first volume of Tongues, by Anders Nilsen, and we end the year with another career milestone, Ephemerata by Carol Tyler. Both books are equally captivating in their own ways and speak to the care and dedication of their respective creators. Both books are multi-layered, push the limits of the medium and maintain the traditional structures in beautiful ways. Other titles in 2025 doing the same at an exemplary level are Insectopolis by Peter Kuper, the collected Gingseng Roots by Craig Thompson, The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco, Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy, Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith and The New York Trilogy, featuring Paul Karasik as editor and contributor. There’s always more to add to a list and it depends upon the focus, among other things. Perhaps it can be dependent upon a cool factor—but we can’t all be cool kids, right? A list of what gets excluded is as intriguing as what gets included. Anyway, I suppose you can honestly get tripped up in terms of what best represents any given year. One thing to keep in mind is that any art form, particularly comics, is years in the making and various versions of it might come out at various years until you get the definitive version. You also have the heavy hitters, the giants in the industry, right alongside newcomers. If you think it’s easy for me and my friend and colleague Paul Buhle to sift through the onslaught on titles each year and review them at Comics Grinder, then you’ve got a screw loose. At the end of the day, it’s those big-name comics artists, out there leading the way, who are hopefully keeping us all honest. They’re there to set an example and are supposed to tell us we’re all in this together. With that in mind, I add to this list, in no particular order, notable cartoonists making notable work: Introverts Illustrated by Scott Finch, available thru Partners & Sons.

Even with the caveat of “favorite” over “best,” I feel these lists are often a testament to what I have not read and what I have overlooked far more than what I love. Nonetheless, I persist with these damn things, because telling people what comics I love is something I was put on this earth to do. Perhaps this is weakness, but nothing has made me gladder as a critic than the kind words from readers and artists alike that I've gotten over the years. I'll go on. (lol) 2025 was a bad year for human rights but arguably a good year for comics. A great argument in favor of it being a good year for comics is that I published a few. An even better argument is that we got the collected Dogtangle this year. My favorite comics are formally ambitious, ranging from literary work to literal pornography, all tied together by a persistent excitement for the medium they live in. I've listed out a few: Dogtangle by Max Huffman, Fantagraphics 2025 is the year of Dogtangle. Social satire that collapses in on itself. Cartoon humor that verges on formlessness. A love story, perhaps. A very big dog. I should have more words about Dogtangle, but how can I sum up this mass of mutts? It speaks for itself, or, perhaps, barks. A Garden of Spheres Vol. 1 by Linnea Sterte, Peow2 A vast, beautiful, curious book that demands revisitation. Wide open vistas for the eyes to drink. What Happened After My Place Got So Humid It Grew Magic Mushrooms and I Ate Them and Got Super Horny by Karasu Chan, J18 I am dead serious, one of my favorite comics this year was this ero-manga with that title. Visually inventive and deeply funny pornography about a woman's delusional quest to make a real friend, bolstered by energetic mark-making and impeccable comedic timing. Likely the comic I have recommended to people in conversation the most this year, tied with the majesterial Dogtangle (usually brought up in different company, mind you ... Usually.). Unsinkable Ship of Fools by Jonas Goonface, Iron Circus Remaining on the subject of pornography (and we must!), nobody draws people fucking right now quite like Jonas Goonface. Ship of Fools is a brilliant work of folklore-by-way-of-sex-farce full of color and weight that should embarrass all other action cartoonists of any variety. Deep erotica that you will return to. Aneido's Anthology 1: The Soul-Selling Corporate Drone & Other Fanciful Tales by Aneido, Red String Translations Recency bias may be speaking here (I just read this one), but after trudging through a fair bit of yuri this year, green or otherwise, Aneido is the artist whose work has captivated me the most overall and this collection is my favorite yet. Their line is soft and pleasant, their stories hang dreamlike in a space between wish fulfillment and something more otherworldly. A reminder that queer comics and alternative comics share the same urge at their root, to do something better than the mainstream. Idella Dell and Valley Valley by Audra Stang, Self published There are a lot of comics I read on social media this year and some of them were even very good. Audra Stang is doing something else, the freshest comics-on-comics thing to come along in a long time. Stang loves her characters, and beats them over and over with deeply familiar grief and rage. Both of these women suck and I am rooting for them. Szarlotka by Jas Hice, Frog Farm A small, fucked up story, one of the most beautiful two-tone riso print jobs I've seen in a long time, a novella of a zine that cements Hice as an artist to watch. I can't get enough of the Hichcockian vice of voyeur and victim in this one. Troubling! SF “Shorts Folio” Serialized Fragments of Supplementary Files #1 by Ryan Cecil Smith, self-published Speaking of amazing riso printing, this comic is probably my favorite book as an aesthetic object this year. These colors, wow! It's been a while since Smith's cast of adventurers last graced spinner racks, and they are truly a sight for sore eyes. You simply have to love a comic about a mailman in space. Round World Thinking by Ana Woulfe, Reptile House Another beautiful riso artifact, that stands beside Dogtangle as a gag comic that is a universe unto itself, a liberatory trans-femme project in the Gendertrash tradition that gets into the weeds with plants and isn't afriad to let out a cackle. More comics like this forever! In brief, I will also mention a few of my favorite reprints and localizations of “classics” from this year: More ink will be spilled on these by yours truly in due time. To take a brief dip in the conflict of interest reservoir, most of my favorite zines this year were by the Hamilton-based cartoonist Zoot, who I have published in my anthology comic Afternoon Affair and who tabled next to my press at Expozine in Montreal. Bias disclosed, nobody is doing it like them. Highlights this year included the informative How To Get Bit By A Werewolf, the furry dyke drama Butch Bait (published by the gods at Diskette Press), and the truly miraculous BL boner pill crack ship The Hardest Day Of My Life. Read those if you get a chance, and you'll understand why I couldn't not mention them. And on that questionable note, I bid you adieu. Hopefully 2026 is a better year for everyone, and a lot of comics are good as well. *** (articles) (top) It's my second annual “Not-E*sn*r Awards by a Former Will Eisner Awards Judge (2020)," where I'll again bypass the nomination process and declare category winners based on my own "Best of the Year" opinions. Any relation between other, official Awards and mine is purely comical.1 Ice Cream Man #43: One-Page Horror Stories by W. Maxwell Prince, Martin Morazzo, Zoe Thorogood, Grant Morrison, Matt Fraction, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Geoff Johns, Matt Fraction, Patton Oswalt, Jeff Lemire, etc. (Image) ~ Best Single Issue/One-Shot You needn’t be familiar with Ice Cream Man and co-creators Prince and Morazzo’s bold, ongoing structural experiments with the medium to enjoy the rich variety of flavors offered, here served in tasty, single-page scoops. Prince adroitly authors multiple stories and writers like Johns, Morrison, DeConnick, and Fraction bring their own unique, terrifying sensibilities, each rendered in styles to enhance the stories, wonderfully told through a variety of narratives and formats. Among the most imaginative are a Candy Land-ish board game, a Gustav Doré-styled descent into Hell, and, most frighteningly: a New York Times front page. Creepy. And yummy. Monkey Meat: The Summer Batch by Juni Ba (Image) ~ Best Limited Series With stylized art reminiscent of Michael T. Gilbert, Monkey Meat immerses you in its hilarious, energetic asphalt-and-jungle world. Inside the Monkey Meat Company, feces are flung at capitalism, gods, tourism, the military, colonization, and even piloted robots. To emphasize his themes, Ba makes full use of his medium with such devices as selective coloring and frequent, intense, in-your-hairy-face splash pages. These absurd, endearing, despicable anthropomorphs have you hoping for further installments. The Seasons, Volume 1 by Rick Remender and Paul Azaceta — Best New Series and Paul Azaceta, The Seasons #1-4 (Image) ~ Best Cover Artist Seasons is a delightfully sinister adventure/horror/mystery, rendered in joyous, vibrant hues. Remender introduces us to the enchanting Season sisters, each bursting with their distinct personalities: Autumn, serious archaeologist; Summer, globe-trotting, temperamental superstar; Winter, passionate artist and mentor to the effervescent Spring, who kicks off a carnival adventure in a thrilling chase of… an envelope? Artist/co-creator Azaceta treats us to bold visuals on every page, and each of his four covers has its distinctive appeal, such as a threatening skull-clown faux-collage and a bold graphic recalling Esteban Maroto and Bob Peak’s Camelot. When you’re in the mood for fun, scary adventure, Azaceta’s creative virtuosity bids you to welcome any time of the year. Little Batman, Month One by Morgan Evans and Jon Mikel (Penguin/Random House) — Best Publication for Kids In Little Batman, writer Evans offers smart and well-delineated answers to nagging questions such as “Why does Batman need to pose as Bruce Wayne?” from the point of view of Bruce’s son, Damian. The young Wayne wants Little Batman’s exciting life all the time — “Homework is a crime!” — but he also learns the importance of being himself. Mikel’s art, a delightful mix of Sergio Aragones and Kyle Baker, keeps things lively, with pastiches of Batman: Year One and Golden Age Batman. And his splendidly fun silent sections — drawn by “Damian” and dabbed with outside-the-lines “crayon”, courtesy of colorist Ian Herring — should inspire even the youngest future Bat-artist. This little Batman story is most enjoyable for big people as well. Daisy Goes to the Moon by Mathew Klickstein and Rick Geary (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Publication for Teens The history behind Daisy is a trip in itself. Briefly, the real Daisy Ashford (1881-1972) began amusing her family with stories beginning at age four. Eventually, J.M. Barrie (of Peter Pan renown) printed them complete with the misspellings and rambling logic of genuine childhood innocence. Here, Geary departs from his established panel format while still displaying his unmistakably endearing storytelling mastery to perfectly tell Daisy’s rocketing adventures. Young readers will delight in her lovable self-admiration, bravery, cleverness, and playful wordplay, as well as her lighthearted, endearing companions. Adults will appreciate the antiquarian science, as well as giggle at Daisy’s spirit and cheekiness. Read it together with the kids. You’ll love it to the moon and back. Emma & Capucine, Volume 1 by Jérôme Hamon and Lena Sayaphoum (TokyoPop) ~ Best International Publication for Teens In this elegant bande dessinée, the teenage Emma and her younger sister are aspiring prima ballerinas with their sights set on the prestigious Paris Opéra. Like a splendidly choreographed dance performance, Lena Sayaphoum’s art is rendered with grace, eloquence, and spirit. His soft, fluid illustration style and muted color palette hit all the right notes to intone this tender tale of discovery, growth, and familial relationships. The Art of Milt Gross Vol. 1: The Judge Magazine Comics 1923–1924 by Paul C. Tumey (independently published) ~ Best Humor Publication Humor knows no decade. Or century, for that matter. The screwball cartoons of cartoon virtuoso Gross show that the best humor is still fresh and hilarious after 100 years. This, the first in a series, presents hundreds of rare, revolutionary cartoons from Judge during the early 1920s, which formed the foundation for Nize Baby, Count Screwloose, He Done Her Wrong, and numerous other successes (for the definitive compendium, see Tumey’s Gross Exaggerations: The Meshuga Comic Strips of Milt Gross, 1926-1934, from Sunday Press). Everyone will identify with the schadenfreudenly-funny frustrations of Gross’s everyman characters who deal with life’s simplest incidents that hilariously snowball from bad to worse to worser to worsest. Plus, the enlightening commentary by historian Tumey adds insight and depth, noting how Gross often reworked his gags, basically stealing from and improving upon himself. With the master of cartoon pantomime, words can’t fully express our enjoyment. And that’s no Banana Oil. Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best European Humor Publication Never mind the Marvel and DC Universes. The best way to enjoy – and challenge – yourself this year is to tumble into the anarchic, delightfully absurd Cornelius Universe. At nearly 400 pages, Spanish artist Torices gleefully explores the entirety of the comics medium through deliriously shifting eras and spaces, which he renders in a madcap array of styles and textures. Cornelius gleefully homages and vastly expands upon everything from Frank King’s Gasoline Alley to European bandes dessinée. And humor knows no boundaries: as proven here, it can be both merry and wretched, hilarious and unsettling. It’s also a celebration of the art of comics, skillfully pushing the very boundaries of the medium. Rich with multiple interpretations, Cornelius generously rewards repeated re-readings. Drawn to MoMA: Comics Inspired by Modern Art by Jon Allen, Gabrielle Bell, Barbara Brandon-Croft, Roz Chast, Liana Finck, Ben Passmore, Walter Scott, Chris Ware, others. (MoMA) — Best Anthology Beginning in 2019, the Museum of Modern Art commissioned an array of comics creators with diverse styles and sensibilities to create new strips, using visits to MoMA as their inspiration. And this book rewards us with fresh, thoughtful short stories offering a variety of approaches – literal and internal – and perspectives – sometimes playful, often poignant – from talents such as Roz Chast, Gabrielle Bell, Ben Passmore, and Liana Finck. Each, in their way, offer insights on the many diverse modes of art appreciation: aesthetic, social, personal, etc. Truly praiseworthy is the book’s ability to inspire and incentivize readers to experience and engage with gallery works as well, and bring back their own stories. Oh, and did I mention that the book also comes with a tall, spectacular Chris Ware fold-out poster, suitable for homes and galleries alike? The Novel Life of Jane Austen: A Graphic Biography by Janine Barchas & Isabel Greenberg (Black Dog & Leventhal/Greenfinch) ~ Best Reality-Based Work Whether or not you’re an Austenite, you’ll find this book as an elegant, captivating study. Barchas’s astute and affectionate devotion to Austen plays out on every page. And Greenberg’s delicate art and soft color palette affords the reader a captivating tour of 18th century London society and a fascinating glimpse into the Pride & Prejudice author’s life from young lady with nascent writing skills to struggling scribe to acclaimed novelist. Projections of Austen’s inspirations for her fictional scenes and character are well defined via her family’s heartbreaking economic and literary struggles. As she comes to realize that she’s “never alone”, we can all be rewarded by so positive a view of life. (Incidentally, Austen’s 250th birthday was just celebrated on Dec. 16) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Graphic Album–New Visually striking and contextually disturbing, this book is ultimately cathartic. Daringly designed with vignettes, ads, and games – Kayla E.’s remarkable tribute to the versatility of the medium – it bluntly explores the author/artist’s life as she endures abuse, emotional and physical, and mostly from her sadistic mother. Her simple, almost cutout-like art is unquestionably moving, capturing her heartbreak and growth. And its bright, vivid colors – especially the shocking red – are intensely penetrating in every unsettling scenario. There’s a creepy familiarity to the surroundings, which a check of the end notes reveals to be true: many pages are inspired by the more wholesome, sanitized 1950s comics like Archie and Little Dot. If you can handle the emotional excursion, you may find some precious hope amidst the rubbish. Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, David Mazzucchelli, Lorenzo Mattotti (Pantheon Graphic Library) — Best Adaptation from Another Medium City of Glass was revolutionary when it was first published back in 1995 – as an exceptionally well-done collaboration between Karasik and extraordinary artist Mazzucchelli – and the term “graphic novel” was relatively unknown. And on its own it’s justifiably considered a masterpiece, due in no small part to Karasik’s influence from Harvey Kurtzman, who he had as an SVA teacher, and Art Spiegelman, who he apprenticed for on Raw. And now we have all three of Auster’s brilliantly interwoven postmodern existential pulp detective stories in graphic novel form, with Mattotti’s art acting as center-story transition in illustrated novel and Karasik himself skillfully providing full-circle closure. These stories are essentially about writing – words – which Karasik and his two sterling collaborators have transformed into stories about words and images, so skillfully structured as to become most valuable as tutorials on communicating complex, intricate narratives – of loss, obsession, even meaninglessness – through creative, evocative visual storytelling. The Red Badge of Courage by Steven Crane, adapted by Steve Cuzor (Abrams) ~ Best International Adaptation from Another Medium Sorry, kids: Cuzor won’t help you write your book report. Instead, he’s given us one of the most powerfully illustrated adaptations of a book you may ever read or see, capturing Crane’s emotional shock of combat as if Civil War photographer Matthew Brady was reporting on that very battlefield. This is an excellent, primal condemnation of soldiers’ terror of dying, of cowardice, and of the damned depersonalization of men reduced to nothing more than fodder. Stark yet subtle chiaroscuro drives home the story’s violent misery, enhanced by Meephe Versaevel’s nuanced coloring, rendering days with muted browns and moonlit nights with soft blues. Crane makes this story real, terrifying, and profoundly human. Muybridge by Guy Delisle and Helge Dascher (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best U.S. Edition of International Material For 25 years, Canadian cartoonist Delisle has been producing first-person graphic travelogues through Asia and the Middle East. Muybridge is something completely different, a classic American story of a ambitious immigrant coming to America, embracing innovation, then fame, rising and eventually falling. It’s a huge-scale biography of one of the greatest influences on early filmmaking, art, and comics, while reading like a Dickens novel. Delisle follows a Canadian tradition of conveying more information, more detail, with far fewer lines, and he uses this to great effect in illustrating Eadweard Muybridge's film and motion experiments while revealing them as prototypical comics. In fact, it’s not just a brilliant biographical novel: it's also a visual treatise on sequential movement that belongs in the hands of any student of comics as well as cinema. Kylooe by Little Thunder (Dark Horse) ‚ Best U.S. Edition of International Material—Asia This trilogy of intimate, intensely emotion-driven stories, unified through a cute, white monster named Kylooe is a heartfelt gem. First is a psychedelic fantasy of an outcast high schooler, a Princess Camille seeking her Little Nemo. Next is a melancholy romance for anyone who’s ever broken up with someone they wish they hadn’t. And finally there’s a father/son tale about government-mandated emotions that hints of Harlan Ellison. This deeply moving, eminently shareable book is smartly rendered by Little Thunder, a pseudonymous Hong Kong author/illustrator, with deeply moving stories that’ll make you wish for a Kylooe in your own life. The Smythes by Rea Irvin, edited by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw (New York Review Books) — Best Archival Collection/Project — Comic Strips Irvin’s artistic legacy goes far beyond Eustace Tilley, his iconic monocled dandy and butterfly enthusiast who graced The New Yorker’s very first cover, with his Smythes among his more obscure works, most unfortunately, as it’s been an unheralded masterpiece. But this has been rectified by Johnson and Shaw with this gorgeous, deluxe, oversize highlighting from the strip, which originally ran Sundays in the Herald Tribune in – of course – New York in the 1930s, post-Market Crash. Every page is a chuckle and a half of clever and endearing banter between milquetoast John and Margie of the outrageous fashion sense. This collection reprints the best of five years of Irvin’s sweeping art and highlighting his eye for playful, innovative design as well as his graceful line. Of the millions of jokes about henpecked husbands and pretentious, social-climbing wives – hello, Maggie and Jiggs! – this is an undeniable classic. And among the back-page miscellany is Irvin’s witty 1943 Sunday funnies parody, Superwoman, which ran once before receiving a cease and desist notice from National, now DC Comics. Lore Remastered by Ashley Wood and T.P. Louise (Simon & Schuster/Image) — Best Archival Collection/Project—Comic Books Louise and Wood’s acclaimed, groundbreaking Lore is now reassembled for your reading pleasure. Part mesmerizing comic narrative, part text with intensifying illustrations, all serve as an engrossing and terrifying story of a woman searching for her father’s killer who discovers that mythic creatures, once banished from the world, are demanding to return. Newcomers to Wood’s art should find themselves enraptured by every image. This collection has added art pieces that astonish on their own. This is one for all lovers of fantasy. Jordan Crane, Goes Like This (Fantagraphics) — Best Writer/Artist You’ll find this in the twisted-mind section of your local bookstore. Within its trip-inducing cover is a daring compendium of narratives that span genres from warped Western to distorted Hitchcock to familiar, bitter relationships to oddly adroit wordplay and more. Crane’s wide variety of experimental, offbeat tales, splash pages, and interstitials evoke Frank King, Geoff Darrow, Seth, Warhol, William Morris, Shag, and, well, his own memorably sensation-inducing genius. Elsa Charretier, The City Beneath Her Feet (Dstlry) — Best Penciller/Inker and Jordie Bellaire, The City Beneath Her Feet — Best Coloring In this bloody action/thriller/romance, Charretier’s layouts explode and just keep exploding, right from the “La Femme Nikita”-style opening. Even in seemingly simple straight-on camera monologues, her slightest of strokes give us telling expressions with bits of business that reveal the character’s pain – tiny tears welling – or bitter joys in suffering smiles. The foregrounds and backgrounds meld into moods you can feel. This is nonstop breathtaking exhilarating, storytelling. And Jordie Bellaire’s in top form. Her colors are brilliant, as in both vivid and radiant. She breathes intensity into the drama and the action by choosing colors you don’t often see, in line holds and panels in specific tones that yell at you to pay attention! Throughout the whole book there’s never a dull page. Never. Jakub Rebelka, The Last Day of H.P. Lovecraft #1-2 (Boom Studios) — Best Painter/Multimedia Artist Red can be a raw, intensely disturbing color, and French artist Rebelka uses it to express the slow demise of horror master Lovecraft. Disconnected, bloodshot eyes are awash in crimson goo. A red-striped lighthouse morphs into a torrential scarlet sea. Blood courses down a hospital wall. A ruddy Cthulhu haunts the background. Lovecraft himself is perpetually presented – in the hospital, with his wife, with Houdini – in unsettling vermillion. Then there are the grays: the gloom that consistently surrounds Lovecraft’s psychological distress. In paint and ink, Rebelka unnerves us to our very heart on each and every page. After having read The Last Day … you may never view red the same way. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn and Quarterly) — Best Graphic Memoir and Mimi Pond, Do Admit — Best Lettering Best Memoir Awards aren't typically given to a true tale of six sisters in England, starting at the turn of the 20th century, but there you go. A study in contrasts, Pond has smoothly and skillfully woven her 1960s working-class San Diego childhood into the lives born to British aristocracy. Also, Best Lettering Awards aren't typically given to works that aren't Todd Klein variations, but every single letter of every word in Do Admit is exquisitely hand-lettered on every page, from cover to end. And I defy any other graphic novel this year to claim anywhere near the skill, imagination, and wit Pond's put into the variety of expressive texts and talking, serif, sans, script, blackletter. And she further enlivens her narrative with illustrations of newspaper and magazine covers, movie posters, maps, and hand-written... memoirs, all bursting from panels and pages, designed, sized, and styled with the greatest dexterity as well as spirit and verve. Best Graphic Novel of the Year? Yes, and not just admittedly but absolutely! ImageTexT, v. 15 #3, edited by Anastasia Ulanowicz — Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism ImageTexT’s most recent online journal has four exceptionally solid, smart, illustrated features with a diverse array of relevant political themes: an exploration of Chris Ware’s New Yorker covers about school shootings; a critical study of anthropomorphism in Soviet political cartoons during WWII; a tough examination of Australian cartoonists’ brutal attacks on Chinese men in the late 19th Century; and an in-depth analysis of the blurred lines between mainstream and underground in the 1970s, citing Denis Kitchen’s Arcade, Bill Griffith/Art Spiegelman’s Comix Book, and Steve Gerber’s Howard the Duck. And hey, it’s absolutely free for you to read right now. How Comics Are Made: A Visual History from the Drawing Board to the Printed Page by Glenn Fleishman (Andrews McMeel) — Best Comics-Related Book When reading a newspaper comic strip, how often have you wondered about the physical process of how they’re created? This question is hardly recognized, much less explored in-depth, in most comics histories. Well, throughout this informative, entertaining book Fleishman provides everything you need to know about the technical mechanics of the medium, which does a great deal enlighten us and enrich our enjoyment. His intelligent, humorous commentaries, with anecdotal asides, are simply a delight. All the information is presented in straightforward style, and expertly enhanced by hundreds of photos of massive machines and other tangible materials of mass reproduction of strips from classic – lookin’ at you, Yellow Kid – to contemporary to web. And as our Sunday funnies fade into the digital aether, why not spend a few post-paper weekends curled up with a comfortable copy of How Comics Are Made? Back to Black: Jules Feiffer’s Noir Trilogy by Fabrice Leroy (Rutgers University Press) — Best Academic Work The more the opportunity to introduce Feiffer to the world, the better the world becomes. And Leroy deserves the highest praise, not only for astutely situating this three-volume loving homage to noir within the broader context of his extraordinarily prolific and diverse art careers but also for his detective work on these detective stories, with insightful analysis of the ways in which Feiffer's loving homage to noir astutely uses American history from the Great Depression through the McCarthy era to incisively satirize and subvert our present culture. Also noteworthy is Leroy's appreciation of Feiffer's visuals: hiscreative reconfigurations of hard-boiled cinema devices into his subtle, sophisticated layouts and unique graceful, limber linework. Comic Book Apocalypse!: The Death of Pre-Code Comics and Why It Happened, 1940–1955 by David J. Hogan (Schiffer) — Best Scholarly Work This informative, engaging history takes an unblinking, insightful analysis of midcentury America's evolving culture, from the start of WWII to the institution of the CCA, which explores beyond the usual sex, crime, and horror comics suspects. Visually rich, with its clean page layouts and hundreds and hundreds of large, sharp color reproductions, this is the most attractive study of that censorious era to date. More scholarly books should be gifted with such luxurious design. Arthur Ferrier’s Pin-Up Parade! by Rian Hughes (Korero Press) — Best Publication Design America can count Russell Patterson, Dan DeCarlo, Bill Ward, and George Petty as its top echelon among classic cheesecake pin-up artists, and in the UK, Scotsman Arthur Ferrier is most highly – and rightfully – held in the highest esteem for his elegant, sophisticated renderings of the female figure during pin-up’s golden age. His prolific output ran from the 1930s to the ’60s, often in humor magazines such as Punch and Blighty over several decades. And now, Korero Press has released a magnificent, oversize, comprehensive, three-volume compendium with nearly 1,000 pages, including hundreds and hundreds of his brilliant illustrations, primarily single-panel gags but also comic strips and a variety of publication covers, adverts, and other ephemera. Ferrier's fluid linework – capturing his women's joyous spirit, expressive gestures, and even their evolving fashion styles - is simply a delight to behold. Plus, a couple dozen pages of each book are devoted to his own essays and correspondence course lessons on his craft. Most impressive for me is the superlative skill with which this dazzling, deluxe collection has been luxuriously packaged to a fare-thee-well with the highest production values by Britain’s master graphic designer/comics artist Rian Hughes. In 2020 Hughes merited two Eisner nominations, “Best Publication Design” and “Best Comics-Related Book” for his superb Logo-a-Gogo, also published by Korero. And here, he’s outdone himself. He’s combined Ferrier’s art with marvelous midcentury colors and typography onto the solid, sturdy cloth-textured slipcase box as well as each of the hardback covers. And then there’s the ribboned bookmarks, patterned endpapers, and luxurious cotton matte paper stock and crisp inks to enhance the vintage aesthetic. Pin-Up Parade! is easily the most spectacular publication of the year, bar none. It’s available in its entirety in England but at this time the first, Showgirl Sirens (1940-1949) – which includes an insightful intro into Ferrier’s career by Hughes – can be purchased in the U.S., with the other two, Burlesque Bombshells (1949-1954), and Cabaret Cuties (1954-1968), in the offing. Best Digital Comic — C’mon: it’s the 21st century and this category is totally irrelevant.

Hothead Paisan by Diane DiMassa Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan Mafalda: Book 1 by Quino, translated by Frank Wynne *** (articles) (top) As another year comes to an end, inside my home there are no seasons, and my bookshelves look like they contain the beautiful, ripened fruit of a perpetual stagnated tree. Returning though, I fear that the fruit will finally fall before being picked. Captain Carrot and the Amazing Zoo Crew still swing from the branches of these bushes, as if their powers of flight were just shenanigans on a bungee cord, awaiting the lost weekend in their company I crave. And too many other tomes are still, so very still, and silent, just their bright spines remaining joyful and noisy unfaded from elsewhere sunlight. As I look again in my bookshelf’s direction however, I am safe in the knowledge that some pages have been turned. I realise this year’s reading has been mostly focused on reading about cartoonists. They have inspired me in different ways: Recently I have been following the line of David Berman on lucky lyric sheets and his Portable February collection. And I have been returning to The Angriest Dog in the World, celebrating that special man. Sometimes we don’t get around to eating all the apples on my Dad’s apple tree, and they land on the ground and start to rot. And that’s ok. Still ... I’m glad comics never go rotten. *** (articles) (top) Below, I've picked 3 books that were all important to me for the same reason: when you have been involved with comics for a long time, as an artist or reader , there will be inevitable moments where you question if the medium is capable of all that you want from it, you begin to doubt your deep involvement in the artform---then, if you're lucky, at just the right moment, works like the ones listed below emerge and affirm all your most utopian hopes for the artform. If your faith is wavering in comics (and if you really love them, you must have this crisis from time to time), read any of these books: Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé I will be writing about this book at length in the upcoming print edition of The Comics Journal, here is small excerpt of what I wrote there: In a New York Times review of this book by Sam Thielman, a character named Michel's worse transgressions are listed, including that he "was in love with a woman who wasn’t his wife." Thielman read Misery of Love sensitively, but I found far more potent moments of Michel’s violence (both sexual and otherwise) in my readings of the book. Here we see how this work can be made anew upon each reading. Thielman stresses that he read the work multiple times (and recommends other readers do the same), but finds different fault lines than I did. Alagbé, in my reading, suggests that Michel has engaged in far worse transgressions, which Thielman ignores or does not see. In one sequence, his daughter Clare’s childhood self is confronted by cries from her mother "it was you who wanted him to be in love with you," "it was you who led him on," "little fool! how did you come up with all this?" One might expect an insinuation like this to occupy the climax of a narrative, but for Alagbé it is one note in the whole blink-and-you-will-miss-it focus and you’ll feel the tragedy, only for it to vanish by the next image — with the mist of it lingering back and forth across the book. One (to me, horrible) image shows Michel cradling Clare, during her childhood, in his arms. Alagbé uses the soft ink wash he employs throughout the book to a shocking effect here: the weight Michel applies to Clare is forceful, his face a distorted mess of wash, his hands cruel. This image communicates brutality, even in isolation. If we looked at it apart from the rest of the narrative, it would still provoke and we would draw conclusions from it, though more visceral than certain. Placed alongside 463 other images, all of them with their own unique weight, it pulsates. As we approach our fourth or fifth reading, the image lodges in our mind, infecting how we look at previous and subsequent sequences. The miracle of Misery of Love is that all 464 images carry the same force of reverberation. Alagbé presents us a "graphic novel" that defies the way in which we have grown comfortable reading graphic novels, which is as prose. This work is actually graphic, in that the images contain meaning independent of textual assistance. In a non-poetic work of art, there are times when information is presented artlessly: "he got in the car," "he ate dinner," etc. An elegant prosaic entertainer can make dead moments like these part of his rhythm, with meaning beyond what is necessary left aside. The plot, after all, must move forward at times. Misery of Love denies itself such license. One image gives us Alain (Clare's boyfriend, who is of African descent) in a car, next to Clare. Alagbé, without telling us, without prodding us, without begging for our understanding, depicts Alain’s at a remove from Clare. His stance, the tension of those seated in front of him, the contrast between Clare’s face and his, an ever so subtlety exaggerated ratio of proportions between Alain and his fellows — it’s as if Alagbé collages Alain into the picture, the expression he wears believable but at the tip of total remove from the scene he occupies. This is how the picture confronted me on my fifth reading. In my earlier attempts, I ignored it entirely. The anger within this drawing is all the more remarkable for how it can be shoved aside until the reader breathes life into it. The book concludes with a smile, one that, once more, throttles us back through the earlier graphics, casting new perspectives on all that we have just witnessed. The greatest works, in thought and in art, are not systematic but living organisms inviting participation of the heart and mind. With Misery of Love, what this final smile means can never be solved, but can be felt with increasing depth the more that is given to the book. The Devil's Grin Vol. 1 by Alex Graham I truly think this is one of the best comics of the past decade, maybe one of my favorite comics ever. With graphic novels as the dominant delivery system for comics going strong for over a decade, most GN's remain single-issue comic ideas stretched out to an undercooked 200 pages (or more). Devil's Grin is worth the pages it's printed on, there's no padding. And while it is long, ambitious and dense, this is a comic much more than it is a novel, its writing is in the drawing (a cliche we hear all the time in comics, but this book can explain the truth at the heart of the cliche) and I love how it's drawn. While certain panels don't match the hyper-perfection of alt comics at their most ascendant, there's no way anyone else besides Alex Graham could draw this: she gets the expressions exactly right in a way that a more "perfect" drawer could never do, all of Noel Sickles printed work (which I adore) combined can't equal the writing (and by that I mean comic drawings) that Graham's cartooning is built on. It's as if Graham figured out how to make the "great American alt comic" by synthesizing the approaches of alt comics literary ambitions with the "draw in your own way" mini-comic movement, which are more opposed than people think. If I was to show a panel from this work to a comics person who swears by the craft of, say, an Archer Prewitt, it may leave them cold. But Graham has, I believe, outdone so many cartoonists who wrestled with a dual loyalty to airtight craft and ambitions of "writerly" comics. Devil's Grin is wrestling with neither of those things, it lays down a gauntlet of its own excellence. Unlike your normal book-of-the-moment faux sensitivity, this work contains a level of emotional intelligence that so many cartoonists struggle to even approach let alone ever come to achieve. While there are intense/"transgressive" moments happening in Devil's Grin, this should not obscure that the book has, as its main focus, an investment in how people treat each other and a sense of moral clarity that most muddled graphic novels never even bother to broach. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard (and many more). Essay by Bill Kartalopoulos, Foreword by Ron Padgett. Looking at this new C Comics collection brought up some thoughts. Since the early '00s, poetry comics DID happen, but they did NOT happen in publications like Ink Brick. There is the famous Jean Cocteau quote about a child prodigy poet, Minou Drouet. When asked what he thought of her, Cocteau said "all children are poets, except Minou Drouet." That's how I feel about Ink Brick. All comics [have the potential to be] poetic, except those published in Ink Brick, comics that just graft cartooning onto outdated and conservative poetic forms. What's happening now, at the heart of comics fringes, is something different than simply breaking up a sentence over many panels and calling it "comics poetry." Instead, many young artists focus on publishing work that is a short exploration of a thought or a feeling, and this exploration unifies text and imagery in the pursuit of eliciting feeling from the reader. Instead of naturalistic fiction (which dominated alternative comic spaces in the '80s and '90s) we begin to see less and less focus on characters. Even autobio seems to be disintegrating. Self-publishing art cartoonists now often begin with an unnamed person speaking directly to the reader, with great focus on how such a person poses on the page, how they carry their weight. We see, in these kinds of comics, an avoidance of epiphany and an avoidance of resolution, though (crucially) without an avoidance of feeling. If we attempt to trace the origins of this, I'd say Doucet looms large, though I'd narrow her influence to before her concessions to alt comic conventions got the better of her (New York Diary and everything that came after, until her return to form with Time Zone J). In an early Doucet strip, called "Month of December," Doucet stands on a bridge and says "Christmas is coming." She sniffs her nose, "it's cold." In the final panel, she hurls herself off the bridge: "... and I'm gonna die?" That is the entire strip. Is it about suicide? Depression? Maybe, but no simple prosaic judgement can contain the strips power. So many emerging cartoonists work in this way today. This makes sense, as pure comics get at the core of poetry better than poetry itself could. Poetry strives to make expression new while working with an inherited set of symbols, the letters of the alphabet you write your poetry in. A comic like Doucet's goes farther, she does not write "I stood on the bridge and began to speak to you." She draws the bridge, her description of this specific bridge is already charged with a poetry that the letters themselves could never contain, no matter how you place them or rearrange them (all the tortured word placement of modernist poetry could have been solved, it seems, with drawing). Traditional cartoonists worked hard to make the bridge disappear. If Milton Caniff's story required him to draw a bridge, he'd do it perfectly, but so perfectly that you would not notice it or linger on it, the bridge merely a prosaic detail to connect point A to point B, no matter how proudly he drew it. Doucet allows the charge of her expression to be seen in every line, you ignore nothing, it's all part of the whole, just as nothing can be discarded or ignored in poetry. Doucet, and the generation that embraces her approach, is not like the group of avant-garde poets who made C Comics. Joe Brainard and his ilk lived and breathed what poetry was and is, they devoted their life to it. When they sought to make comics, the tools of poetic expression were already on call within them, and the tools were finely honed. The work in C Comics feels mature and exact, work made by people conscious of what they were doing. Poetry comics circa 2025 are most often made by those with no (or little) interest in orthodox poetry, but instead in how comics can be used for self expression. This search for how to use comics in a mature way has been subverted and derailed for a century. When someone taps into the poetic potential of comics, you see it happen on the page, you feel the charge, "finally, this is how it can be done!" Lately, I see this moment of conception everywhere, all the parts coming into place organically and the thrill of artistic gestalt happening in a way that it has really never happened before, the absolute triumph of raw artistic discovery. You'd think C Comics would connect to this, but it feels oddly distant, not so much a relative to today's explosion as it is an acquaintance who, if you come to think of it, you never actually met. And yet, despite this disconnect: as contemporary underground and fringe comics lean deeper into their poetic destiny, it is very important that this book is out now. C Comics is a tome that can now be corresponded with, there is enough strength in contemporary and organic poetic comics that the community making them won't be bulldozed by what is within this book ("it's already been done"). Instead it can act as a prophecy that you missed, and reading it now is exhilarating in its affirmation but not so influential as to change the flow of where we are already headed. Post Script: I haven't finished Melissa Mendes' The Weight yet, but I read the early chapters years ago and found them incredible. This list wouldn't be complete without mentioning this book that I look forward to reading in full in the new year. *** (articles) (top) I’ve been on a monthly comic embargo since I left high school, but 2025 was the year to reel me back in. Kieron Gillen and Caspar Wijngaard started knocking down the dominos they’ve been setting up for the past 10 issues of Power Fantasy. Christopher Priest's essays at the end of Marvel Knights: The World to Come have been just as engaging as Joe Quesada’s art. But without a doubt Absolute Martian Manhunter was the mainstream comic of the year. Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez are working in the Vertigo-tradition: reimagine a dusty DC IP, let the writer cram in as many purple prose captions as they need to describe the human condition, and pair them with an artist who can work outside the current house style. Probably their greatest achievement is making a comic with art that communicates instead of just illustrates. The fourth issue of the series starts with the cosmic-bringer of bad vibes known as “The White Martian” drawn like the silhouette on a men’s bathroom sign, with a black body and white circle head. In the next panel he lifts his head from his neck, then in the third he places it into the sky on the fourth panel, creating a heat wave that drives an entire city into a homicidal frenzy. Later in that same issue, the metaphorical enlightenment-golem known only as “The Martian” grabs a ray of white sunlight reflected in the protagonist’s eye, stretches it in his blocky hands, and separates it into three circular colors: red, green, and blue, the three colors that make up visible light. He overlaps the red and green–coincidentally the same colors used to signify the presence of The Martian throughout the comic–to create the color yellow, which he then places onto the city’s horizon as a setting sun, calming the madness and making everything right. It doesn’t make much sense explaining it, but you’ll love it when you see it. In the indie scene, I read some great stuff this year. Harper B’s Bring Me the Head of Susan Lomond was an extremely enjoyable one-shot that proves that funny comics usually have funny art. Corinne Halbert’s still finding fresh and funky ways to express her psychological journey to happiness in her newest installments of Scorpio Venus Rising. Audra Stang’s Another Year comics on Instagram are expanding the lore of Valley Valley and Idella Delle in tiny snippets that leave me wanting something longer. I also had the pleasure of picking up the first issue of Monograph Magazine at this year’s MICE Expo: a fanzine edited by Ivy Lynn Allie, E.B. Sciales, and Warren Bernard focusing on single panel cartoonists. This inaugural issue goes over the life of single panel cartoonist and first woman member of the National Cartoonists Society Hilda Terry. These were all small press triumphs, but if I had to choose a favorite indie of this year, I’m going with the obvious choice. I might be one of the four people currently reading Love and Rockets who’s closer in age to Tonta than Maggie. Life Drawing is the second trade starring Jaime’s new protagonist and her circle of friends/family. It’s nice to see Tonta get some breathing room after her last story, which felt like she was competing for attention with her pulpy family drama. Here we get an intergenerational crossover with Maggie and Ray while also getting to meet some of Tonta’s peers — I’m personally attached to the bug-eyed comic-lover Gomez, whose life feels closer to where I was at as a teenager than the more free-range Tonta. It’s a little disappointing that we only have 130 pages after ten years. Even two back-to-back weddings felt understated, but this collection gives the feeling that Jaime’s working up to something big. Until then, I’ll be reading and rereading what I have, just like with all of Jaime’s other comics. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a terrible year in many, many ways, but it was a great year for comics. Here's a dozen or so of my favorites from the past year: Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me: Mimi Pond's books are always great, and she just keeps getting better. Spent: Enter the Bechdelverse? Alternate reality Alison Bechdel hangs out in Vermont with the Dykes to Watch Out For cast and it's an amazing read. Raised by Ghosts: Briana Loewinsohn's been one of my favorite minicomics creators for years, and her graphic novels are even better. Life Drawing: Jaime Hernandez has been so consistently great for so long that people don't even comment on it when he drops another classic. The Love and Rockets curse. Absolute Batman: Extreme in all the best ways. Just a blast. Transformers: Another nostalgia trip, but a fun one. The '80s Transformers comic book we see in our heads when we think of what we were reading 40 years ago. The G.I. Joe and Void Rivals tie-ins from Skybound have been a lot of fun, too, and I'm glad that Larry Hama's still writing a monthly G.I. Joe comic and hope he gets to keep on doing that as long as he wants. You and Me on Repeat: Mary Shyne's debut graphic novel. Groundhog Day with teen angst and quantum mechanics in the mix. Looking forward to seeing what she does next. And to Think We Started as a Book Club ...: A best-of collection of New Yorker cartoons from Tom Toro, one of my favorite cartoonists from that magazine's 100-year run. Actual laugh-out-loud cartoons. Instagram cartoons from Joey Alison Sayers, Jeffrey Brown, Mike Dawson, Jen Sorensen, and Luke McGarry: I'm not on Instagram all that often, but the political, diary, and just-plain-weird comics from these artists help get me through the day. Ooops...I Just Catharted! 50 Years of Cathartic Comics: Terrific hardcover collection of unsung visionary Rupert Kinnard's Cathartic Comics from Stacked Deck Press. I hope this book leads to a reappraisal and renewed appreciation for his groundbreaking comics. The Essential Peanuts: Did we really need another Peanuts book? Of course we did! Mark Evanier on Charles Schulz with some all-star cartoonists sharing stories about the world's greatest comic strip. What's not to love? Almost Sunset: Wahab Algarmi's debut graphic novel has a lot of heart, and I think kids and parents will be reading this one and sharing it with friends and family for years to come. Top Two "conflict of interest" books of 2025: The Nefarious Nights of Willowweep Manor: The follow-up to Shaenon K. Garrity and Christopher Baldwin's hilarious The Dire Days of Willowweep Manor. Madcap hijinks for anyone who loves Agatha Christie and Jane Austen, or who's seen the Clue movie fifty times. I'd love for them to do a third book to make this a trilogy. Snoopy, The Story of My Life: The Myth, The Legend, The Beagle! Did we really need another Peanuts book? I must think so, or I wouldn't have written this one, Snoopy's autobiography, illustrated with classic Peanuts comic strips. I love the design, too, which looks and feels like a book I'd have checked out from my local library a hundred times as a kid. *** (articles) (top) I can’t remember how I got hung up on the Mitford sisters and their what-do-you-mean-one-of-them-was-a-duchess-and-one-was-a-Communist-and-two-were-literal-Nazis drama, though it probably started with reading Nancy’s gossipy biography of Enlightenment scientist Émilie de Châtelet, Voltaire in Love. And I’ve been a fan of Mimi Pond since … well, if it’s too glib to say “The Simpsons,” her two graphic memoirs about working at a diner in Oakland are fabulous, not to mention essential reading if you want to live in the Bay Area. So for me the event of the year, no contest, was Pond’s Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me. Pond’s cartooning is smart and witty and just weird enough to do the Milfords justice. Read with your jaw dropped from beginning to end. In other, non-Pond news, this was a great year for new artist debuts. Kayla E. came out of nowhere for me, which probably means I was looking in the wrong places, but Precious Rubbish blew me away. So did Yudori’s historical drama Raging Clouds, in different but equally powerful ways. Ben Wickey’s More Weight: A Salem Story is a towering achievement, but then there’s the quieter beauty of Lee Dean’s The Girl Who Flew Away. Finally, this is an amazing time for manga. We’re finally getting a lot of great older manga in translation, including The Legend of Kamui, Ashita no Joe, and, from secret essential comics publisher New York Review Books, Fumiko Takano's Miss Ruki. Takano is primarily an alternative manga artist, and if more of her work gets translated it will blow your brains out your ears. Gene Bride by Hitomi Takano is an amazing feminist sci-fi manga that I hope is getting the attention it deserves. Oh, and everything out of Smudge is a must-read for me because I cannot resist gross old manga, but this year’s Smudge standout is Shinichi Koga's Mansect. MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! Happy holidays! *** (articles) (top) My list of 3 favorites this year are all smart, tender stories that attend to the topic of growing up, but in very different ways. Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) Clever, distinct and devastating, the trauma and resilience of Li’l Kayla are delivered in a clean and spooky mid-twentieth-century comics frame. Through a dense intertextual web, Precious Rubbish expands and illuminates the potential of the form. Jelly Cake #2 by Stef Choi (self published, stefchoi.com) Animator-turned-cartoonist Stef Choi’s autobiographical coming-of-age comics are a delight. While other girls are donning thongs, tween Stef wears a homemade diaper-sized menstrual pad to school where she dodges racial epithets and pines only for nacho day and a boy named Michael Camaro. Cannon by Lee Lai (Drawn & Quarterly) When I finished reading Lee Lai’s book the first time, the words I chose to describe it were: “a rich story, elegantly told." The characters in this gorgeously rendered black and gray graphic novel are written with intricate, intersecting plot lines that explore family (both blood relations and queer-chosen), grief, growing up, repression, and rage. Watch for magpies, meditation, and plantar fasciitis. *** (articles) (top) We're all here on this end of year round up because we LOVE comics. I’m a comic book artist who also happens to work at a comic book shop. You can find me slinging books, Blu-rays, toys and more at legendary Sci-fi megastore & emporium, Forbidden Planet in NYC. These were the books that made the biggest impact on me this past year. Whether they made me think, grow a big smile on my face, laugh out loud or cry watery tears, these books had the GOODS. In no particular order, here's a selection of 20 outstanding works from 2025, in a medium I truly adore ... COMICS. Okay, okay, you got me. It's actually 21 comics. I tried and tried to make this list an even 20, alas some great stuff came out right at the end of the year and I couldn't leave any of these gems out. Without further adieu ... Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC! Still intensely thinking about it and I read this puppy WEEKS ago. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodríguez (DC Comics) I adore this series, Javier Rodríguez is a true visionary artist and his sense of color transcends realms. This team of creators is POWERFUL. Absolute Batman 2025 Annual #1 by Daniel Warren Johnson (DC Comics) HELL YES, get 'em! This was SO satisfying, DWJ gives the people what we want, this one-shot is truly OUTSTANDING. E Is for Edward: A Centennial Celebration of the Mischievous Mind of Edward Gorey by Gregory Hischak (Black Dog & Leventhal) This book is EXQUISITE. Getting to see smaller panels on huge page spreads brings me immeasurable joy, simply GORGEOUS. My Gorilla Family and Other Stories by Ichiro Iijima, translated by Ryan Holmberg (Living the Line) OBSESSED. This freshly translated 1970s horror manga anthology is absolutely bananas. It'll make you laugh, make you puzzled, and fill your heart with wonder and joy. Exquisite Corpses by James Tynion IV and more ... (Image Comics) So damn FUN and extremely DARK with incredible characters, genuine suspense and impeccable pacing and storytelling. The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) A beautiful and raw expression of extremely difficult experiences and emotions. Tyler provides the reader with a TRANSCENDENT experience. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore (Pantheon) An extremely important, well researched and compiled historical account of the History of Black Resistance that is lovingly told with beautiful artwork, moments of humor, ire, genuine feeling, and a whole lot of DEPTH. Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees: Rite of Spring by Patrick Horvath (IDW) Disturbing and masterful, this story has got me HOOKED. There Will Be Tears by Charles Burns (Partners and Son) Drawings so insanely beautiful they will both BREAK and MEND your heart simultaneously. The Devil's Grin: Book One by Alex Graham (Fantagraphics) Exceptional writing and character development, Graham builds a STRANGE world we can identify with deeply. Viscere #2: Folk Horror edited by Katie Skelly (Stregasporca) Soothe your inner hedgewitch with this outstanding horror anthology filled with MACABRE tales by fabulous femmes. Orphan and the Five Beasts: Bath of Blood by James Stokoe (Dark Horse Comics) James Stokoe's artwork is PHENOMENAL, this outstanding limited series has great writing and a well developed universe. His take on epic battle scenes and creepy, gooey guts and gore is a pure delight. Saga de Xam by Jean Rollin and Nicholas Devil (Anthology Editions) STUNNING. This blew me away, I had no idea one of my favorite directors wrote this lushly illustrated, magnificent graphic novel all the way back in 1967. THANK YOU, Anthology Editions for bringing this astonishing tome back into the world. Toxic Avenger by Matt Bors and Fred Harper (Ahoy Comics) Matt and Fred EXCEL at continuing the adventures of Lloyd Kaufman’s titular character, THE TOXIC AVENGER. Adventure Time (2025): The Bubbline College Special #1 by Caroline Cash This is so damn CUTE. Gorgeous artwork and coloring, a beautiful coming of age sapphic tale filled with classic Adventure Time capers and lots of chuckles. Skinbreaker by Robert Kirkman and David Finch (Image Comics) JAW-DROPPING artwork and exceptional world building make this a must read series. Moan by Junji Ito (Viz Media) HORRIFYING and delightful, I have yet to ever be disappointed by a Junji Ito book. The Confessional by Paige Hender (Silver Sprocket) GORGEOUS artwork compliments this delightfully wicked period piece about vampires, sinners and wannabe saints. Rats Eyes: a Games and Puzzles activity book (expanded 2025 edition) by Hyena Hell and Josh Bayer (self-published) Two completely unstoppable FORCES OF COMICS NATURE combine their powers to bring you a love letter to BLACK FLAG in the form of a puzzles and games book that is so damn fun, it'll completely melt ur eyeballs. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard, foreword by Ron Padgett, essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books) Curious, adventurous, kooky and GROUNDBREAKING collaborative comics made by Joe Brainard and his New York School poet friends in the 1960s. *** (articles) (top) The usual caveat: I can’t keep up! The sheer variety of “comics,” its profusion of genres, formats, presses, and publishing sectors, frustrates any bid for comprehensiveness. Each year, I end up reading more of the year’s recommended comics after I file my list with TCJ than before, and even at Eisner-voting time (months later) I feel behind. My list this year, a score of titles, privileges book-length comics and publishers of same — no surprise, as it was a great year for such. Come springtime, I hope to compile a drastically revised best-of list. (Thanks to Nami for the manga tips!) Spent, by Alison Bechdel (Mariner Books). Colors by Holly Rae Taylor. If you can’t get out from under your reputation, why not spoof it? That logic seems to underlie Spent, a winking autofiction in which “Alison,” the character, gets rewritten, Fun Home gets parodied, and the prospect of its TV adaptation sparks a nervous comedy. Spent boasts, besides Alison and her partner Holly, a community of characters from Dykes to Watch Out For. As Alison suffers from creative block, struggling with a memoir-in-progress about consumer capitalism, the larger cast steers the story into funny, humane territory. Self-indulgent? I’d say loving and ingenious: a playful, inevitably political time capsule of this moment. Kaya #24-31, by Wes Craig (Image Comics). Colors by Jason Wordie. As I said two years ago, Kaya is a familiar sort of story: a postapocalyptic quest starring two super-powered kids, mismatched siblings, one of whom is a prophesied Chosen One. Together they rove, and together they fight robots and monsters. I know, I know. But Craig has been running flat-out from the starting gun, topping himself again and again with pages of thrilling inventiveness and moments of surprising emotional oomph. The sister/brother conflict is credible, the psychic stakes complicated, and the world-building crazed. Even the robots have problems. Craig’s drawing and Wordie’s coloring go hand in glove. Pure, craftilicious pleasure. Goes Like This, by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics). Crane’s best work tends to be elegant yet anxious: classic cartooning with desperate emotional undercurrents. Muted but astringent, his comics mix graphic classicism with existential terror; at the same time, the work is gorgeously swoon-worthy. This curiously designed volume (with varied paper stocks, an exposed spine, and visible stitching) gathers in more than a quarter century of comics and prints, walking a tightrope between narrative understatement and visual splendor. Compulsive worry and quiet dread are delivered with severe narrative control and deadpan pacing, but also ravishing color. The book is both a printer’s orgy and a masterclass in holistic design. Mike Dawson's Monthly Minicomic Club, by, yep, Mike Dawson (self-published subscription service via Patreon). Dawson lives up to his motto, “self-publishing is a power,” every month. Though he has many graphic novels to his name, and another forthcoming, his zine/minicomic service is the heart of his work. Each month he sends out a mini (usually digest- or CD jewel case-size), typically an observational slice of life riffing on pop culture (Hamilton, Stranger Things, Queen), sometimes from a bemused dad’s perspective, often politically charged. Dawson happily mocks himself, and embarrassed recollections of his younger self are constant. The work is somehow both high-spirited and contemplative, in a rounded, fat-lined, insanely readable cartoony style. I’m hooked. FML #3-6, by Kelly Sue DeConnick, David López, Cris Peter, and Clayton Cowles (Dark Horse). This apocalyptic, vaguely semiautobio sitcom set in Portland may be the best comic book DeConnick has written (and that’s saying something). A breathless farce about schoolmates and bandmates, and then again the agitated adults around them, most especially a tensely wired yet lovable punk-rock mom, FML nails the nightmarish, post-COVID, Trumpian world we now inhabit. Each issue hijacks different genres and piles on new absurdities, some all too painfully real. Artist López is assured and delightful, managing the chaos with loving inventiveness. This series fairly screams “passion project,” and, like a costume party at an ICE stakeout, gives me hope. Muybridge, by Guy Delisle (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Helge Dascher and Rob Aspinall. Delisle’s latest, tonally deadpan yet graphically sharp as usual, recounts not only the career of Eadweard Muybridge and the invention of chronophotography but also the dawning of photography in general and even of cinema. Basically, Delisle treats Muybridge as the missing link between photography and moving pictures. At the same time, his Muybridge is no hero; Delisle stays detached and ironical, treating the man’s trials and wrongdoings (even the committing of murder) matter-of-factly. There’s no pathos in Muybridge’s decline and death, but you can tell that Delisle is fascinated. Ingenious and insinuating — a rare feat of explanation and oblique commentary. Precious Rubbish, by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). This is one of the most harrowing memoirs I’ve read. Kayla E. adapts layouts and drawings from roughly mid-century children’s comics, turning them into templates for a terrifying story of familial dysfunction and incestuous abuse. Taking up the aseptic formalism of Chris Ware, she goes even further, into drawing that is frankly stilted and repetitive, full of exactly repeated poses that give her pages a sort of Colorforms aesthetic. Filtering awful details through this insulating formalism, the book elicits feelings of helplessness, rage, and horror. This feels like triumph of self-understanding and release, as well as, perhaps, righteous vindication. Astonishing. Checked Out, by Katie Fricas (Drawn & Quarterly). Checked Out follows a young queer cartoonist and librarian in NYC as she researches an impossible project, navigates a funky workplace, and endures breakups and loneliness. Its 350 pages blow by like a bullet train, funny and fearless, in a sloppy-looking, ostensibly deskilled style that’s actually quite skillful and evocative (comparisons: early Groening? Allie Brosh?). The book’s offhand manner belies its pinpoint observations and droll self-awareness. I read most of it standing up, in one long, flow-state session. It’s that kind of trip. Smart as hell, and touching, with an ending that makes failure (by standard measures) look like victory. Life Drawing, by Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics). This latest collection from Xaime compiles comics that were already great as a serial (in Love & Rockets). I enjoy re-reading them in one go. Here, two of Xaime’s signature characters, middle-aged Maggie and younger Tonta, are on a collision course, in humorous vignettes that bring out their foibles, vulnerabilities, and assumptions (while also eavesdropping on many other believable characters: the usual miraculous repertory cast). Xaime has a talent for reintroducing characters you think you know from unexpected angles, and he does that here, oh so slyly. The results are droll, charming, and moving – and, of course, cartooned to perfection. Mansect, by Shinichi Koga (Smudge/Living the Line). Translated by Ryan Holmberg. Social outliers literally turn into bugs in this round-robin story of contagion, metamorphosis, and, naturally, body horror: an antetype of Junji Ito’s work, or, if you like, Charles Burns’ Black Hole. Childish bodies age and shrivel suddenly; people are swallowed; an infant feeds on its mother. One victim leads to another in a chain, and pseudoscientific rationalizations cannot quell the nauseating unease. Holmberg and Smudge do heroic service here, translating Koga’s creepy mid-Seventies manga into one handsome, icky volume. The grotesque imagery will eat you up from the inside. Oddly, I enjoyed this, and thought about it a lot afterward! Raised by Ghosts, by Briana Loewinsohn (Fantagraphics). This delicate, flickering book, a semiautobio reverie, evokes a 1990s girlhood via discreet, emotionally subtle comics, punctuated by revealing passages of diaristic prose (journal entries, notes-to-self) that appear as artifacts or scraps interleaved throughout. Bri’s handwritten notes grant her relief from a broken family and frightfully quiet house (her parents are heard but never seen). Loewinsohn, however, avoids overstatement, preferring muted pathos and poetic bemusement. Just over halfway through, Bri falls into a long dream, a visual tour de force, and the book shifts, ending on a surprising note of affirmation. The story is entirely Bri’s, inward, subdued, and immersive. Surrounded: America’s First School for Black Girls, 1832, by Wilfrid Lupano and Stéphane Fert (NBM). Translated by Montana Kane. Surrounded (originally Blanc autour, Dargaud, 2020) recounts the founding, growth, and eventual destruction, but also lingering influence, of Prudence Crandall’s academy for young women of color in Canterbury, Connecticut. Lupano’s scenario mixes scrupulous research with speculative elements, including symbolic characters whose voices amplify radical and feminist perspectives. Fert’s Mary Blair-influenced art is delicate but vigorous, cartoony yet historically anchored. The tale continually underscores the ambient threat of racist violence (sadly fulfilled in the end), yet the telling is discreet and the lead characters irrepressible. Ably translated, with an informative afterword by the Prudence Crandall Museum, this deserves a brighter spotlight. Land of Mirrors, by María Medem (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Aleshia Jensen and Daniela Ortiz. A lone woman tends a lone flower in a lonely, unpeopled landscape. The flower gives her purpose and pleasure, but anxiety too. Unexpectedly, a stranger befriends her and leads her to a land of sociable if vague people who surround themselves with mirrors. Among them, she feels joy, release, but also distrust. This Spanish fable about aloneness and community is narratively elusive and abstract, yet formally exquisite, built out of delicate linework, intensive patterning, braided symbols, and otherworldly, psychedelic color. The formalism recalls John Hankiewicz, the palette Peter Max, but Medem is unique. I restarted this the moment I finished. Tongues, Vol. 1, by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon). Tongues modernizes the Prometheus myth on a grand scale, yet in cool, crystalline, and disorienting style. An unnamed prisoner (our Prometheus) has his guts eaten out by raptors, over and over; gradually, the prisoner and his torturers learn to converse. Meanwhile, a young woman on the run may just kill the king of the gods. Anomic human functionaries (mercenaries, drifters) scurry around in the gods’ orbit; the very cancellation of humanity may be imminent, and the wastes of war are everywhere. Hypnotically designed and colored, Tongues boasts pages the likes of which I’ve never seen. It’s also bracing and prophetic. A Song for You & I, by K. O’Neill (RH Graphic). This middle-grade GN is quintessential O’Neill: a pastoral, pseudo-medieval coming-of-age fantasy with anticapitalist, communitarian vibes. Here, a headstrong ranger-in-training (with a flying horse!) makes a bad decision, then must atone by aiding a young shepherd/musician. Each helps the other overcome their shyness and regrets. I didn’t recognize the assigned gender of one of the characters until quite late, but that’s fitting; gendered self-recognition is key. The novel’s quiet treatment of trauma and self-doubt echoes O’Neill’s Tea Dragon series, but with more breathing room for spare, decompressed storytelling (and fetching, Miyazaki-esque art). A lovely dispatch from a great body of work. Black Arms to Hold You Up, by Ben Passmore (Pantheon). Satirical and didactic, this graphic novel depicts generations of Black resistance to white racism. Passmore writes with his usual offhand wit but also an aggrieved heart and new tenderness. Protagonist “Ben,” cynical and despairing, gets unstuck in time as his father takes him on a tour of Black history, starting with the betrayal of Reconstruction and coming right up to now. Passmore never ducks complexity; his portrayals of militants and communities are often mocking and sharp. But he’s never cheap. Ben ultimately embraces what he has been dodging, in a finale blending rage, love, and even hope. Epochal, beautiful, brilliant. King-Cat Comics and Stories No. 84, by John Porcellino (self-published). John P.’s King-Cat is a pillar of my reading life: a periodic gift that blends love, loss, anecdote, and reflection. His cartooning is beautifully spare and perfectly attuned to what he has to say. Every issue moves me. This latest one is particularly sad, saying goodbye to old friends (human and critter) and to his mom. I felt sad for John while reading it. Then again, it also made me smile and, once, even laugh out loud. Childhood memories, everyday busyness, Zen parables, an isometric diagram of his own bed (mournful and funny) – once again, it’s a complex, full-hearted treasure. The Legend of Kamui, Vols. 1 and 2, by Sanpei Shirato (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, and Alexa Frank. I first read Shirato in the Viz/Eclipse Kamui floppies of the late 1980s. These impressed me with their historical texture, Marxist critique of class, and stoic brutality. They were bracing. Turns out they were translations of Kamui Gaiden from the 1980s, not the legendary Kamui Den serialized in Garo in the 1960s. This sumptuous new D&Q series adapts (at last!) the Sixties work, with much drawing by Shirato’s assistant, Goseki Kojima. The plot is long and tangled, and the tone, unsurprisingly, downbeat and fierce. Kamui himself is just one player in the sprawling cast. Astringent comics: tough-minded, tragic, but grand. Ashita No Joe: Fighting for Tomorrow, Vols. 2 and 3, by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba (Vertical). Translated by Annelise Ogaard. This classic manga is a troubled story of aspiration and hunger with a melodramatic, utterly committed style. It follows Joe, an indigent young boxer, proud, belligerent, and rash; his mentor Danpei, a washed-up, alcoholic ex-prizefighter reliving past glories through Joe; and Rikiishi, a more clinical boxer on whom Joe fixates as rival and nemesis. Their rivalry starts in a reformatory (this is also a prison story) but ramps up when Riikishi and Joe get out of stir. Joe is often genuinely unlikable, an asshole really, yet I’m compelled to root for his rise. An addictive cocktail of violence and pathos. Ginseng Roots, by Craig Thompson (Pantheon). Craig Thompson’s best book-length comic, inspired by his childhood experience working in the ginseng fields of rural Wisconsin. Wildly ambitious and self-contradictory, it’s at once a revisiting (and partial repudiation) of his breakout book Blankets, a study in how agribusiness (in this case ginseng farming) shapes everyday life, and an excuse for globetrotting journalism. Thompson’s unguarded earnestness (practically a badge he wears) belies the rigor and intelligence of this sprawling, uncategorizable book, in which luscious brushwork collides with diagrammatic infographics and Thompson delivers some of the most gorgeous comics pages I’ve seen. I reviewed this for TCJ back in July. Absolute Wonder Woman #4-14, by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Jordie Bellaire, and Becca Carey, et al. (DC). Tegan O’Neil digs this comic, and so do I. I don’t care about DC’s “Absolute” line, but this series remains their brightest jewel, a badass remix of Wonder Woman that feels more alive and radical than almost any other WW comics since Marston. At first, I thought the pitch (WW as a sorceress raised in Hell) was stupid, but boy I was wrong — as I said last year! The issues with fill-in artists (subbing for Sherman) are less awesome, reminding me of the genre’s strict clockwork and aesthetic patchiness, but they’re still good. My favorite superhero comic of recent years. The Ephemerata, by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). This study in grief makes for a stunning exhibition of organic, inky drawing — cartooning dug and chiseled from the hard stuff of life. Its beauty underscores its weirdness: starting out as a Bunyanesque allegory about dwelling in “Griefville,” it builds a quirky mythos out of private, hermetic symbols, but then settles into literal autobiography of a sort familiar from Tyler’s past work. As usual, Tyler pours everything she has into the work, every shock, ache, and loss. The results are wayward and bemusing (like three books knotted into one, really) but also staggering in their flinty honesty and wise reflection. Mushishi Collector’s Edition, Vol. 1, by Yuki Urushibara (Kodansha USA). Translated by Andres Oliver. There’s a whiff of Kitaro and Black Jack about this weird early-2000s manga that follows the wanderings of a cool, laconic man of mystery. Yet the mood is different: sad, curious, quietly restive. Ginko is an itinerant mushishi: an expert in mushi, strange, protean beings mostly unseen by humans that nonetheless impinge on human hosts, imparting both strange powers and tragic burdens. Are mushi like germs? Are they like ghosts? Ginko, knowledgeable and aloof, serves as a go-between, Kitaro-style, solving (or sometimes failing to solve) problems caused by mushi infestations. Beautiful, eerie, and full of confounding dilemmas and haunted characters. Clementine Book 3, by Tillie Walden Walden has invested so much in this Walking Dead trilogy that, for me, its franchise origins fall away. The whole series is good, but the last book stuns. Here Clementine, her partner, and friends settle into a semi-utopian refuge, which Walden then complicates in a most disconcerting, anti-utopian way. Two conflicting leaders, both powerful women, clash over how the community should be protected. Meanwhile, Clementine is blindsided by grief. The role of violence in securing utopia is one of the reigning themes; what might happen to you when you trade human vulnerability for armored strength is another. Soulful and haunting. Comic Arts Los Angeles, Dec. 13-14, 2025. Not a comic, a festival. CALA has become the pivot in my comics year (which, I now see, runs from roughly May to May). When CALA was on hiatus (2020-2023), I missed it. This year was as wonderful as last: I got to see friends and favorite artists, host a panel, and learn about art and artists new to me. Many of my comics friends feel as if there’s a gushing firehose of mediocrity these days, and little of interest, but I disagree; seeking out new comics continues to be a joy. CALA amplifies that joy. Thanks, organizers and volunteers! *** (articles) (top) LAAB #3 by Ronald Wimberly, et. al. (Beehive Books) Apparently the final issue of Ronald Wimberly's political-cultural broadsheet-broadside, this time putting comics visuals from Tradd Moore and Celine Loup and others next to long essays in tiny print you read by wrestling the publication upside down. Comics as street literature, in a delivery vehicle you might fold into a paper airplane and throw at your local reactionary. American Reaper Book One by Pat Mills, Clint Langley, Fay Dalton (Millsverse Comics) An old Judge Dredd Megazine series collected and self-published by co-creator Pat Mills. There's some art by the unjustly ignored Fay Dalton, but the strip is dominated — indeed detonated — by the work of Clint Langley, whose pages of digitally activated fumetti images feel like putting your head inside a fan oven and enjoying it. On top of revisiting how Langley was augmenting comics with software in 2011, the book now forces you to reckon with what someone possessing one inch of Langley's gifts might type into ChatGPT hoping to reverse up the same road and get to this destination the easy way. Essential Judge Anderson: Childhood's End by Alan Grant, Kev Walker et al (Rebellion) Rebellion's eternal reprinting program presents (again) Psi-Judge Cassandra Anderson in 1993's Childhood's End, Alan Grant and Kev Walker's Chariots of the Gods on Mars number. For my money this is a bigger artistic deal than the near-contemporary stories drawn by Arthur Ranson which have become the anointed classics. Writer Grant's solo custody of Cassandra Anderson for 25 years was 2000 AD's greatest achievement that no one talks about, plotting a coherent course for her as a telepathic seeker who could still execute people in terrible ways without hesitation. This Essential volume adds Grant's final Anderson stories from much, much later, which are short and unhappy and repetitive and depressingly shallow, because by then the editor had clearly told him to knock all that off. Kirby at Marvel 1956-1963 by Michael Hill (self-published) Doctor Strange: A Decade of Dark Magic by Stuart Moore (Marvel/Bloomsbury) One of these is a self-published painstaking appraisal of Jack Kirby's grand achievements in the run-up to and aftermath of Fantastic Four #1, collated from primary and secondary sources plus modern community discussion and much peering at the actual art with a microscope, an extension of Michael Hill's According to Kirby blog. The absolute flaying of Stan Lee along the way reads Lee's creative shortcomings as personality flaws, springboards from there to his sexism and racism, and parallels the dogged persistence of Stan Lee exceptionalism with the number of people prepared to vote for Donald Trump. The other book reviews the first ten years of Doctor Strange comics from a fan-turned-pro's perspective, and indeed from Marvel's perspective since it published this via Bloomsbury. Being Ditko-adjacent compels Stuart Moore to mention the artist's "eccentric sociopolitical views," but that's blistering criticism compared with the glad hand offered to Stan Lee. A concluding anecdote from SDCC circa 2015 reports no shadow of The Man's late-life hassles as he twinkles in full magic grandpa mode, "a thoughtful man taking decades of criticism to heart." As with that bonkers official Stan Lee documentary, whether this is true or not is secondary to its role in brand management. The Jigsaw Review #1 edited by Mal Earl (Gweni Press) The start of an intended archival anthology series reprinting material from the UK's 1980s and 1990s small-press and indie circuits, which is almost terra incognita compared to the well-mapped things happening in North America at the same time. The Complete Crepax Volume #9 by Guido Crepax (Fantagraphics) If things had run to the original plan, which was ten annual volumes from February 2016, then 2025 would have brought the final one and the conclusion of the whole vast Crepax reprint project. Some bumps in the road have led to this year actually bringing book #9 of 12 instead. It would be fair to say the series has had its longueurs. But Volume #9 storms out of the gate, every strip crackling with sensual static. The four stories about Crepax's Anita character work as erotica and 1970s social commentary and horror fiction and the indulgences of a man drawing naked ladies, all caught in the turbulence of Crepax's artwork, trying to suggest what the sexy feels like not just looks like. How exactly does Crepax wring such demonic erotic mood from a little portable TV before a horny Anita starts copulating with it? How does he conjure Anita's self-destructing climax blasting the machine to bits, a smoking ruin between her thighs? You could stare at the pages for an hour and still not be on top of things. Mandala by Andy Barron (The Mansion Press) Love and death and resurrection in silent black-comedy melodrama and blazing Risograph-effect colors. On first read I thought the three main characters were Adam, Eve and Satan; but they might be id, ego and superego. Barron knows comics: the punch ups are all Kirby poses and power, and having ascended to orbit prior to a ballistic descent like Superman, the male-coded Um surveys a bulbous Kirby kosmos, asteroid belts and all. *** (articles) (top) I've been a die hard fan of the work of scénariste Alain Ayroles ever since I moved to France. This year, amongst other things, he released the final volume of the 'first cycle' of the intriguing L'Ombre des Lumières series, a transatlantic homage to Choderlos de Laclos' famous novel Les Liaisons dangereuses (and who could forget the film staring John Malkovich, Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer!) The writing, albeit in French, is magnifique and the artwork solidly supplied by Richard Guérineau who gives as much life to bleak colonial North America as he does the manicured lawns of 18th Century France. Ayroles uses extracts from letters written by the protagonists as a narrative device throughout, keeping you guessing as to who wrote what, to whom, and why at each instance. I shall not reveal the denouement — because I haven't actually finished reading it yet! *** (articles) (top) One book that really stood out for me this year was Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez, which blends mind-bending trippiness with a totally bonkers and heartfelt alternate version of DC's green Superman cipher. The best of the Absolute line from last year (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman) subverted expectations of the characters while still maintaining their defining core elements, while Camp's cerebral script and Rodriguez's experimental layouts and visual storytelling take it further to flip the script on the genre itself. If DC expands this for another six issues I'm there for them. *** (articles) (top) Like every year, I read a lot of things in 2025. Almost all of them were quite old. In no particular order, here are a few things that came out this past year that provided some relief from the chaos of the real world … Crickets #9, Sammy Harkham. An absolutely stunning cover and, as always, gorgeous art and compelling storytelling. My copy came with the incredibly cool bonus Hayseed zine, which is filled with sketches, notes, etc. Sammy is consistently one of the very best. Precious Rubbish, Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). All of the praise and attention that has been directed toward this gut-wrenching masterpiece is well deserved. I was lucky enough to read this brutal memoir during the process of its creation and knew it would be something special. Here’s an interview Mark Newgarden and I did with Kayla about the book for The Comics Journal. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life, Dan Nadel (Scribner). An utterly fascinating read that sets the bar high for biographies about living cartoonists, and controversial figures, generally. If you know very little about Crumb, it’s a great book. If you think you know everything — or at least all you need to know — about him, it’s an ever better book because you will learn much more. Crumb is certainly not for everyone, but for those seeking to learn just how he came to be the person he is, it’s all here. Here is an interview I did with the author about the process of making the book. Mineshaft #46. Another great issue of my favorite magazine. This one has amazing front and back covers by Drew Friedman, an interview (about death) with Robert Crumb, and many pages of great work by Noah Van Sciver, Simone Baumann, Christoph Mueller, Sammy Harkham, Aaron Horkey, David Collier, Robert Armstrong, Glenn Head, James Collier, Tony O'Neill, Jose Arroyo, William Crook Jr., Max Clotfelter, Billy Childish, and Joost Halbertsma. The Art of Lale Westvind. I have many of these Banzai Collection monthly anthologies and love them all. This one presents many pages of Lale’s wonderful art and has a very cool poster included as well. Banzai is really doing a great job curating important work by amazing artists that serve as great introductions to historical bodies of work. Smoke Signal 44 - Gary Panter Solo Issue. A 32-page tabloid full of Gary Panter’s art. If you were lucky enough to get your hands on one of these, hold onto it. It’s a thing of beauty. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly). A complex story involving historic sisters (who I had never heard of before the book arrived), this is a wonder–Every page is something to stare at for quite a while. As Tammi Morton-Kelly wrote in The Comics Journal, Mimi “delivers a luminous portrait of the Mitford sisters, a family whose charm and contradictions have garnered a rabid cult following.” Read the full interview here. Lattaland #4, Josh Latta. I really Josh's series of nasty gag panel comics, but this one contains something different. A personal story about his dying father set in a nursing home during the holidays. Leo Derek – In the Heart of Danger, James Stewart & Joshua Stewart. This actually came out … a while ago. It’s a 40-year-old treasure that has been unearthed. Definitely worth gawking at. It’s one of the many fantastic offerings from the new indy comics distributor Power Pulp. The Smythes, Rea Irvin, edited and with an introduction by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw, afterword by Caitlin McGurk (New York Review Books). Like many, I would imagine, the only thing I knew about Irvin’s The Smythes were the couple of pages in Bill Blackbeard’s Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics (1977). Johnson and Shaw collect more than 160 of Irvin’s gorgeous pages that show off his wit and subtle humor. ou can read Tammi's analysis of the book for The Comics Journal here. Scorpio Venus Rising #4, Corinne Halbert. Every page is great. Read a TCJ interview with the very talented Corinne here. The Complete C Comics, Joe Brainard, with a foreword by Ron Padgett and essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books). People can finally see for themselves the two volumes of obscure art comics that Brainard — and a host of collaborators — cooked up and self-published in the 1960s. HYPE*PUPjr, Frank Santoro. Frank's latest issue of his zine, which served as a recap of his inaugural Destination Dealers Con held here in Pittsburgh in November, took almost two years to come out. And this may be it for Frank's monthly color broadsheet. I'll miss getting these in the mail if that's true. They remind me of hardcore punk singles from the early '80s somehow. Hopefully all 48 issues will be collected some day. The Ephemerata, Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). A beautiful book about a troubling subject, but one that we all must face. Carol spent many years — and hours at the drawing board — charting out her thought about grief to create her most ambitious book yet. Also, I had the great fortune to get a sneak peek at a few things by some of my favorite artists. I’ve read a bunch of the penciled pages for Kim Deitch’s work-in-progress tentatively titled, Living the Dream, and cannot wait for this one to come out. What I’ve read are autobiographical pages about his breaking into underground comix and they are wonderful. I’ve also read a chunk of Jim Woodring’s mind-blowing take on the style and format of a 1930s Big Little Book, Quacky. It’s nuts in all the best ways and unlike any Frank story you’ve ever read. Jim perfectly captures the awkward narration of those books and gives them his own strange twist. That’s it for now. Stay safe everyone, and try to stay sane. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman and Absolute Martian Manhunter proved the cape-and-tights crowd might still have some life left in them. Peter Kuper’s Insectopolis explained the importance of nature’s creepy-crawlies. Mattie Lubchansky avoided the sophomore slump with Simplicity. Don’t let the colors and layouts fool you, Kayla E’s Precious Rubbish made for bracing reading. Patchwork by Kate Evans sewed together the threads of Jane Austen’s life. Ben Passmore’s Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance dramatized undertold episodes from American history. Yazan Al-Saadi’s Lebanon is Burning and Other Dispatches had relevance in this year of ceasefires where the firing never ceased. Finally, Taha Siddiqui and Hubert Maury’s The Dissident Club combined combing of age story and political thriller. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was strange: I witnessed a cultural reset that felt like a complete assault on my senses. Rhian Teasdale, the lead singer of Wet Leg, wearing a shirt that says, “Men are so back” is a good visual summary of this past year, and I’ve been coping by simultaneously gorging on junk food (rom-coms, reality TV) and healthy meals (books, good comics). As the gender divide gets deeper and discourse becomes rife with binary thinking, I found comfort in work that wasn’t afraid of ambiguity; that encouraged conversation and discourse, especially from a unique point-of-view. Here were some of the bright spots during an otherwise confusing and weird year: Do Admit! The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly): A 440-page historical graphic biography and memoir about the Mitfords, a noble British family of six eccentric sisters who were highly active in politics during the 20th century. Pond worked on this book for six years and it shows: Do Admit! is a marvel of research, writing, and drawing. Pond’s expert hand produces a light and breezy line, while dimensions and details are rendered in a Prussian Blue ink wash: her drawings are just as charming as they are immersive. While reading the book, I realized it somewhat disturbingly functions as a mirror to the present day as it recounts the history of fascism through the female perspective. As it becomes weirder and weirder to be a woman each and every day, I take solace in Decca (Jessica) Mitford’s story, who became a prominent muckraker and civil rights activist despite her gender and family’s conservative politics, making me believe that if she could do it, maybe we all aren’t so doomed after all. The Ephemerata by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics): The first Carol Tyler comic I read was “Uncovered Property” (1987) from Crumb’s Weirdo #20, in which she weaves in a subtle statement about gender dynamics through a funny childhood anecdote. Tyler has continued to explore her family in her decades-long cartooning career, culminating in The Ephemerata, the first installment of a two-part graphic memoir detailing a decade in which she experienced many deaths in quick succession. The book is breathtakingly rendered with deliberate crosshatching that reminds me of Tove Jansson; I have never seen anyone draw trees like Tyler can. Though the journey through Griefville can be painful (I did cry while reading this book), The Ephemerata has a relatable candor that will make readers who have also experienced significant loss feel seen. Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank (New York Review of Comics): This is a complete collection of Fumiko Takano’s “Miss Ruki” comics, which appeared monthly in Japanese woman’s magazine, Hanako, from 1988-1992. These full-color, 2-page comics are about Ruki and Ecchan, two women exploring their newfound freedom as working professionals in Japan’s 1980s economic bubble. The book serves as a happy antidote to my overstimulated eyes, and it is no surprise that Otomo and Matsumoto were huge fans. Miss Ruki boasts clear lines, simple pastel colored palettes, and minimal yet well-balanced backgrounds. Most radically, Takano uses her comic as a vehicle for critique of this rapidly changing time in Japan: I think of the comic from April 9, 1992, where Ecchan calls Ruki for help with her brand new rice cooker. Ecchan uses her cordless phone to contact Ruki with ease, but Ruki, still using a corded phone, humorously runs back and forth from her rice cooker to her phone to give Ecchan the instructions; making me think about how when technology makes our lives easier, faster, and more efficient, we begin to revere the minor inconveniences of yesterday. Kus #54 ‘It’s All Good!!!’, anthology edited by Caroline Cash (Kus): Cash’s editorial voice in this full-color 160-page pocket-sized anthology is best captured through her contribution to the book, “Drunk Girls”, an autobiographical comic about an off-kilter encounter in the dive bar bathroom. Featuring 20 international cartoonists, Kus #54’s comics observe the quotidian through an absurd Larry David-esque, yet emotionally intelligent, lens. I loved the comics by Tara Booth, Anand, Jurijs Tatarkins, and Leo Fox. My favorites include: “Magic Novice” by Emma Hunsinger, a story that uses magical realism to explore the nature of love; “Double Trouble” by Vivianna Maria Stanislavska, a comedic yet existential exploration of work, life, and death; and “Jessica” by Margot Sounack, who defines the “Jessica poster effect” during a drunken party that is beautifully rendered in pencil and marker. Akin to her own visual voice, Cash has curated a simultaneously thought-provoking and gut-busting reading experience in Kus #54. Hairspray Magazine #1, anthology edited by Karla Paloma (Self-published): Printed in black and white and featuring 10 international contributors, Hairspray Magazine features comics centered on the female experience, especially sex— Paloma’s editorial vision is simultaneously grotesque and accessible, making the anthology feel like a worthy companion to Chevli and Farmer’s Tits & Clits. My personal favorites from this anthology include “Me and my Bouffant” by Martina Sarritzu, “The Terrible Story of my Hair” by Noemie Barsolle, and perhaps the funniest one of the book, “The New Carreer” by Simone F. Baumann, whose visual style reminds me of the late Aline Kominsky-Crumb’s — a 9-pager about a woman leaving her publishing career to become a sex worker. Bold, defiant, and capturing the spirit of underground comix, Hairspray Magazine won “Best Alternative Comic” at the 2025 Angouleme Comics Festival, and I’m looking forward to the next issue debuting January 2026. Prop Comic by Veronica Graham (Most Ancient): A feminist reimagining of Popeye in the form of a broadsheet 20-page minicomic: Instead of Popeye, what if Olive Oyl was the main character? Through dizzyingly creative page layouts that brings to mind the idiosyncratic compositions of Chris Ware, Graham presents Olive as an avatar to explore our modern day anxieties about digital communication, the economy, and relationships. Artfully poetic, I always discover something new when I re-read this comic. Szarolatka by Jas Hice (Frog Farm): An 80-page risograph minicomic about a young mother whose life becomes upended by a strange neighbor.Beautifully printed in Federal Blue and Red, Hice’s visual language is simultaneously playful and somber; making their depiction of femme-specific experiences, such as objectification and motherhood, refreshingly accessible and a pleasure to read. I haven’t seen anyone depict femme interiority with such subtle mastery as Hice does. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram Books): A risograph minicomic depicting a surreal, psychedelics-fueled horror story about friendship and creative passion. Myers’s storytelling is poetic yet sincere, and her art exhibits a virtuosic talent for inking. There is an amazingly jaw-dropping spread near the end that I think about every now and then. I hope Myers makes comics forever. Wedding Juice, Issue 3 by Sanika Phawde (Self-published): I was lucky to get a sneak peek of the third installment of this Ignatz award-winning series at Gutter, a Brooklyn-based comic reading show hosted by Clar Angkasa and Mikey Maiden, back in June 2025. Wedding Juice is an autobiographical series that depicts the days before an Indian-American wedding. In this issue, Phawde uses bold colors and unique camera angles to show the hijinks that ensue when figuring out “wedding underwear” and “wedding priest” (you will have to read it to find out more!). Wedding Juice is distinct in its charming, empathetic, and humorous approach in depicting the cross-cultural experience– I’m excited for Issue 4. Tarwar by Ilan Manouach (Nero Editions): I stumbled upon this book at Printed Matter and was immediately drawn to its formal qualities: a black cover with its title in rainbow holographic letters, fuschia endpapers, and interior pages full of black panels that transform speech bubbles, onomatopoeias, and motion lines into main characters. Tarwar is a collection of black panels collected from millions of digitized comics across various countries and genres. Captivated by its aesthetic appeal, I purchased it immediately. Upon further research, I learned about Manouach’s conceptual approach to comics, which makes him no stranger to scrutiny, including of course, here at TCJ. Controversy aside (I’d rather eat glass than talk about AI Art), Tarwar is a beautiful book that fits perfectly in Manouach’s catalog as it asks more questions than it answers. Is it poetry? Is it theft? Is it art? Is it even … a comic?? For me, the only thing I can answer is that Manouach’s work scratches that navel-gazing itch that art school unfortunately trained into me. *** (articles) (top) No time for explanations or exclamatory descriptions! Too many holiday things to do! Here, in no particular order, are 10 of my favorite comics this year:2 Honorable mention: Absolute Martian Manhunter, Miss Ruki, The Smythes, The Once and Future Riot, Roy #1, Holy Lacrimony *** (articles) (top) I’ll start with Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang, since it deals directly with the spiritual rot of resentment and self-loathing predictably bred by popularity contests, artistic or otherwise. Evocative, discontinuous one-page vignettes cluster around a rivalry between the two title characters; Valley (at one point shown ice skating) is the Tonya Harding to Idella’s Nancy Kerrigan. Stang’s cartooning is pared down and punchy, served well here by each page having its own rich two-color Riso palette, courtesy a knockout print job by Frog Farm head honcho Alexander Laird. The story is littered with screens, mirror images, and projections of both the electronic and psychological variety, while the zine itself is a material argument in favor of printing and binding. I first became aware of Suerynn Lee at a panel of New Yorker cartoonists at the Art Students League early last year. The organizers ran a slideshow of the participants’ cartoons on a screen overhead while the panelists talked, and Lee’s had a depth and bite the others seemed to lack. Later Lee revealed that she alone among the panelists started making each cartoon by drawing rather than writing. Now, I think Chris Ware was onto something when he said that “allowing one’s drawings to suggest the direction of a story is comics’ single greatest formal advantage,” and by all appearances Lee makes full use of that advantage. The drawings in her zine Two Snakes (published by Christina Lee’s Alright Editions) are gorgeous — sinuous brush lines and atmospheric washes, translated beautifully into stochastic screens of melancholy ultramarine blue. A haunting fable about intimacy, art, and the ways we periodically outgrow ourselves and each other, it makes me hope that Lee keeps making comics like this in addition to single-panel cartoons. I’m sure Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish will — and certainly deserves to — appear on many of these lists, but I’m going to make a case for I’ve Always Known You!, a Riso zine printed by Travis Head at Virginia Tech. Where Kayla E.’s other comics get a lot of mileage out of the tension between the horrors of the story and the airtight slickness of the drawing and design, I enjoy the way the printing here brings a soft, slightly grubby touch to the presentation. Given her many allusions to classic kids comics, it’s a thrill to see some authentic misregistration, and at a certain level I think a story like this — characteristically concerned with abject abuse and neglect, as well as almost unfathomable pain and the miraculous possibility of its ultimate transcendence — should leave the reader’s hands a little dirty. I’ve already written about how much I love Gary Panter’s issue of Smoke Signal from this year, but I’d also like to shine a light on the very next issue by Tara Booth. While many cartoonists have broken out a paint box now and again, I can’t think of any whose work engages the language of painting — not only color but touch, viscosity, transparency, etc. — in the service of cartooning more successfully than Booth’s does. In this way her forms fully embody her primary theme of the tragicomic indignities of hungry, sweaty corporeality. Like Kayla E., Booth has an ambitious hardcover book out that should find its way onto many best-of lists, but for me the broadsheet format of Smoke Signal provides a more generous canvas for her discomfiting, hilarious, and often strikingly beautiful work. Nick Bunch’s How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes (Cram Books) is a sublimely cynical and enjoyable addiction/recovery memoir. Bunch, like a lot of younger cartoonists, seems to have learned to draw from watching The Point! on YouTube while eating fistfuls of brown acid and caffeine gum — and yes, I’m saying that like it’s a good thing. How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes is manic, breathless, claustrophobic, and compulsively readable. There's a grotesquely funny scene where Bunch’s lymphatic system is wrenched free of his body and subsequently holds a publishing meeting that’s worthy of Burroughs. I had a blast reviewing Mansect for TCJ.com, and two subsequent Smudge titles — Face Meat and especially My Gorilla Family— are also favorites from this year: glorious slabs of vintage Japanese grand-guignol weirdness brought Stateside with tender loving care by translator Ryan Holmberg and publisher/designer Sean Michael Robinson. And finally, the belated appearance of a U.S. collection of Quino’s Mafalda (Elsewhere Editions) — arguably the most important Latin American comic strip in history — is a major event, despite the nearly unforgivable lack of a contextualizing essay or even the years in which the strips were originally published. Speaking of context: if you want to be chilled to the bone, read it while keeping in mind Quino’s answer to a reporter’s question of what Maflada would have been like as a grownup: “Mafalda never would have reached adulthood. She would be among Argentina’s thirty thousand disappeared.” *** (articles) (top) Runaways by Rainbow Rowell, Elena Casagrande, and Roberta Igrata I have a strange and secret soft spot for Marvel’s Runaways, a book which definitely belongs under the "capes" label, but just barely. When the team was first created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona in 2003, the series was hailed as one of the most fascinating titles from Marvel at the time. The team had a wonderful mix of X-Men melodrama, Fantastic Four sci-fi concepts, and a Buffy-esque sense of the teenager. Second only to Vaughan, Runaways is defined by the writing of Rainbow Rowell, who has written runs on the series several times at this point, and likely has more Runaways issues under her belt than Vaughan himself. Rowell brings the same vibrancy essential to this run, which started in June 2025. It spawned from the rather uninteresting "One World Under Doom" event which recently ended to a collective yawn and eye roll, but Runaways exists largely apart from the greater Marvel universe. At its heart the run is a fun, jaunty character piece full of angsty teen witches, psychic velociraptors from the future, and existentialist Doombots. The series, which is coming out in trade in February 2026, is well worth picking up from your local comic shop. New Gods by Ram V and Evan Cagle DC’s New Gods is one of those rare superhero comics that were so incredibly ambitious, strange, and masterful when they were first created by Jack Kirby, that it’s hard to imagine topping its original run ever again. Ram V and Evan Cagle might just have done it. New Gods is one of the best monthly comics to be hitting the shelves of your comic shop. Full. Freaking. Stop. V nails the grand, sweeping tone that makes DC comics so compelling. Paired with Cagle’s intricate, jaw-droppingly beautiful art along with hall-of-famer guest artists such as Travis Moore and Filipe Andrade, the tales of Kirby’s Fourth World come to life once more. If you’re looking for a carbon copy of Kirby’s Fourth World saga, you’re not necessarily going to find it, but many of the really important parts of Kirby’s story are all there. V’s story is all about the grand forces of war and peace, beauty and ugliness sweeping powerful beings up in their path. I’ve always felt that Kirby’s work on the Fourth World contained in it a lot of the sadness of a man who had seen the awful realities of war and lived to tell its gutted tale. That melancholia, that sense of grief for a reality mired in conflict is all there in V’s New Gods, but also there is hope for peace and love that underscores all of Kirby’s New Gods comics. Ram V’s work is often compared to that of the British invasion, and until new gods his notable capes titles, such as his Detective Comics, have been in conversation with that movement. New Gods however, feels like the exact kind of elaboration on Kirby’s work that the King of Comics would have wanted. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodridguez, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou If New Gods is one of the best monthly comics hitting shelves this year, Absolute Martian Manhunter is the best monthly comic of 2025. Combining Deniz Camp’s astounding writing with the auteurship of Javier Rodriguez, Absolute Martian Manhunter recreates its titular character in a way no one but these two wildly talented creators could. Camp, who will appear again later on this list, is one of the best contemporary comic writers working. Absolute Martian Manhunter reimagines one of DC’s strangest and least appreciated Justice Leaguers as a counter-terrorism intelligence agent who begins to be able to visualize, touch, and taste other people’s thoughts and emotions as the world is overcome by a great and terrifying evil: Darkseid. New Gods and Absolute Martian both reimagine Darkseid in ways that put his other modern and contemporary depictions to shame, imagining him as a sublime, unintelligible force of irrational "anti-life." Rodriguez’s art, which blew me away in his Zatanna and Defenders: Beyond has evolved to unimaginable heights. Opening up Absolute Martian to Rodriguez’s colorful depictions of the human consciousness is one of the great joys of comics this year. I would be remiss not to also sing the praises of my favorite letterer of all time Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, who is a frequent partner of Camp, and makes it impossible to ignore the wondrous alchemy of lettering. Ultimate X-Men by Peach Momoko Peach Momoko needs very little introduction to readers interested in the more fringe elements of the superhero comics world. Momoko had a rich background in underground manga before becoming a phenom for her watercolor cover art and her X-Men miniseries Demon Days. Momoko is a true auteur, writing, drawing, and water-coloring her books. When Demon Days first hit the stands I was blown away by both the sheer scale of the project and its striking quality. Like Javier Rodriguez in Absolute Martian, however, Momoko has outdone herself in her newest X-Men book, which reimagines the team as a group of Japanese middle-schoolers who gain powers and are swept up in the battle between good and evil. Like much of the great shonen manga coming out of Japan right now, Ultimate X-Men takes what could have been a pretty cut and dry story concept, and imbues it with an emotional weight and maturity you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a book starring middle-schoolers who get powers. The book revolves around the conflicting forces of grief and isolation, and friendship and connection. Batman Superman World’s Finest by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, and Tamra Bonvillain I’ve praised a lot of DC’s current editorial direction over the last year or two, but their current event, "DC K-O," is one of the most half-assed, lackluster, and generally uninspired attempts at a story I’ve read in a long time. That being said, some of its offshoots, like those of "One World Under Doom" have impressed me. Waid and Mora’s Worlds Finest is one such series. Waid is one of those true industry pros who tends to really get his characters right. He’s worked on excellent runs of Daredevil, Fantastic Four, and Flash to name a few. When I say World’ s Finest may be the Mark Waid comic I am most impressed by, it really means something to me. He’s doing God’s work in combatting the kind of punch-em-up driven idiocy that is at the foundation of K-O, choosing instead to write a rare character portrait of the two most legendary superheroes of all time. The book is driven, fundamentally, by the friendship between its two titular heroes, along with their love for their various Bat- and Superfamilies. Mora’s art has the dynamism of Jorge Jimenez mixed with Chris Samnee, and it’s hard not to find a smile plastered across your face looking at the candy-colored blurs of Superman and Batman flying across the page. Plus it’s got some really excellent banter between Supes and Bats, which I really can’t get enough of. Batman by Matt Fraction and Jorge Jimenez After a bit of a mixed bag run on the title by Chip Zdarsky, fellow comics powerhouse Matt Fraction took on the Batman mantle with Jorge Jimenez, who was also a standout artist on Zdarsky’s own run. Jimenez and Fraction’s first four issues on Batman may become a generationally excellent run akin to Grant Morrison’s time on the title. Jimenez’s layouts are filmic, conveying action with a cool dynamism that a character like Batman just needs for a good run. Fraction also brings all the best parts of Zdarsky’s run into his own, focusing on a Bat family unified by love and support, rather than the typical catty strife that lazier writers return to over and over again. Supergirl by Sophie Campbell and Tamra Bonvillain Sophie Campbell’s Supergirl is one of the most enjoyable DC comics coming out right now. It’s heartening to see a female superhero book written and colored by two trans women, and edited by an all-woman team, especially after the Red Hood debacle. Campbell brings a refreshing messy goofiness to Supergirl that I found immediately satisfying. Campbell clearly cares a lot about the characters she’s writing, bringing a great deal of respect to every page without taking herself or the series too seriously. Each issue is emotionally compelling but also downright hilarious, with this month’s issue being a touching and rather horrifying holiday special about abandonment and trauma. Ultimate Spider-Man by Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checcheto, and David Messina Jonathan Hickman. The name rings with a kind of super-hero sanctity. Hickman became famous for his work on operatic Marvel stories like House of X/Powers of X, Secret Wars, and his runs on Avengers and Fantastic Four. These stories are spoken of in reverent tones by comics nerds. They’ve become the standard by which all other superhero events are judged, and very few events measure up. That’s why it was so shocking to find that Hickman was writing a single-character book on Ultimate Spider-Man. The premise of this book is simple: what if Peter Parker became Spider-Man as a forty year old husband to Mary Jane and a father of two? The answer is a sweet, funny, and beautiful story far more about family and community than it is about loneliness. I think of Ultimate Spider-Man as a portrait of what our superhero comics would look like if we ever allowed them to break free of the horrifying chronal stasis they are trapped in. Hickman’s Peter Parker is a character who evolves and matures, is allowed to love and laugh and grieve. I hope the series is indicative of the direction Hickman wants to take his future work. The art in these issues really shines as well, with some of the best inking from Checcetto and Messina as well as the best non-Momoko coloring from Matt Wilson. Black Cohosh by Eagle Valiant Brosi Black Cohosh is one of the most fascinating books I’ve read this year. Brosi’s work is an experimental tour de force in this novel. Ignoring the confines of the panel and perspective, his art grows out of the page with the free wildness of an untamed wood or a child’s mind. Black Cohosh is a tough read, as most books about painful childhoods are. The autofictional memoir follows Eagle as he grows up in an alternative living commune in Appalachia. His speech impediment makes him a target for child and adult bullies alike, and his only nurturing relationship is with his mother, who takes him out into the woods to hunt for plants and herbs. I would liken this book to Jeannette Walls’s seminal memoir The Glass Castle, which details her nomadic childhood brought up by similarly eccentric and neglectful parents. Black Cohosh is narratively and aesthetically virtuosic and I would not hesitate to say that, if you are looking for something akin to an American avant-garde in comics and literature, Eagle Valiant Brosi is a card-carrying member. Cannon by Lee Lai Lee Lai is the cartoonist who came closest to making me cry this year. Lee is one of the most important contemporary queer artists of our time. The book is a whirlwind of queer love, rage, friendship, and loneliness. Cannon follows the harrowing friendship of Cannon and Trish as they navigate the trials and travails of an aging friendship between adults. Cannon is a book that could only exist as a comic, melding the interior worlds of its characters with the external one, creating a novel which hovers somewhere between magical realism and gut-wrenching novel. Assorted Crisis Events by Deniz Camp, Eric Zawadzki, Jordie Bellaire, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou As foreshadowed, Deniz Camp appears twice on this list. Assorted Crisis Events is probably the most formally interesting work on this list, aside from, perhaps, Black Cohosh. The central question of this science fiction anthology masterpiece is "what if all the strange things that happen in a capes crisis even were happening to normal people all over the place?" In each issue, of which there are now seven, we follow a new protagonist as they are plunged into one of these crisis events; in one issue, a woman grapples with PTSD after she was forced to relive the same sixty seconds over and over again millions of times; in another, a woman must care for her husband who wakes up as a child with no memories of her one day, and as an old man the next. Camp’s work on Assorted Crisis Events feels very much in line with the formal experimentation of the great British Invasion writers and artists, who took it upon themselves to combine their narrative prowess with the untapped potential of comics as a medium. Like the great books of the Vertigo era, Assorted Crisis Events is the brilliant product of Camp, Zawadzki, Bellaire, and my beloved Otsmane-Elhaou, who come together in this book to make something greater than the sum of its parts. I should warn that this book is not for the faint of heart. Its vision of the future is apocalyptic, rarely, if ever cathartic, and all almost always heart-breaking. Adventure Time: The Bubbline College Special by Caroline Cash Caroline Cash’s Marceline and Princess Bubblegum lesbian love story one-shot for Oni Press’ newly revived Adventure Time comics is a real light in the darkness of this year. Written, drawn, colored, and lettered by Cash, the issue is in its third printing, and for good reason. Cash is doing what she does best: making hilarious and adorable lesbian rom-com comics. There’s a bit of her Peepeepoopoo comics in the one-shot, but really this is a book for young gay kids who are either discovering themselves or are in desperate need of self-representation. It’s a wonderful primer into the world of gay love stories in much the same way that the original Adventure Time was for a whole generation of kids. I’ve already bought two printings of the Bubbline College Special, and I’m contemplating getting a third, it’s that fun. Adventure Time by Nick Winn and Derek M. Ballard I’ve reviewed Winn and Ballard’s Adventure Time comics twice for Fanbase Press, at this point, and I could do it several more times without losing steam. I was an avid reader of the original comics from the 2010s, and these are very much in line with those weird little comics masterpieces. There’s a sense of freewheeling whimsy in these pages that reminds you of the importance of play and wonder not just in comics but life. If you’re a stickler about adaptations, and I certainly am about Adventure Time at least, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by what Winn is doing in his main stories, as well as Ballard’s back-up mini comics. They preserve the sense of the original cartoon and the old comics adaptation. *** (articles) (top) There's one in every comics library – that irresistible, untranslatable foreign masterpiece. You deploy DeepL and Google, but they surrender, unable to make sense of its distinctive dialogue. The gorgeous illustrations pull you back in anyway, inviting you to search each panel for clues. Yet even without understanding a word, this is a volume you pull out often, sharing it with friends, and dipping in at unexpected moments, like a favorite book of poems. Now, Fumiko Takano's slim, gorgeous Miss Ruki is finally available in English, deftly translated by Alexa Frank. This sweet, singular volume, praised by manga stars from Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) to Keigo Shinzō (Tokyo Alien Bros.), is one of my books of the year. Miss Ruki is 58 kaleidoscopic views of friendship. Two small-town girls, meeting again as adults under the bright lights of Tokyo, try for a bond which eluded them in childhood. With each snapshot of their grown-up lives, Takano is manga's Cartier-Bresson, capturing life's decisive moments with laughter and surprise. Her pen lavishes attention on the least utensil, bicycle basket, and library book, while bringing each shop clerk as fully to life as her two main characters. This is how Takano sees, how Ruki sees and, by the end of this lovely book, how we do as well. Perhaps that's the biggest gift of this delightful collection, granting us a sixth sense – of humor. After reading this book, Takano's unique take on life's fads and foibles stays with you, revealing Miss Ruki moments everywhere you turn. *** (articles) (top) Crimehot, Alec Robbins, Silver Sprocket Rly good. Valley Valley/Idella Dell, Audra Stang, Frog Farm Audra Stang cartoons with such emotional audacity that the weak will doubt there’s any effort to it. Miss Ruki, Fumiko Takano, New York Review Books Charming and delightful strips, beautifully drawn, which, considered in sum and with the context of Alexa Frank’s excellent translator’s essay at the end, portray how economics impact the use that normative social systems have for difference. When money is good, a friendly weirdo can be someone whose choices simply don’t align with the mainstream but whose presence affirms that mainstream as a site of choice for those within it. “They” can flourish well enough in warm juxtaposition. When money is bad, the Other is no longer tolerable because their different value set has been vindicated — they become an unwanted example to normal, formerly-successful, people suffering a loss of security. My hope is that people reading Miss Ruki will see the folly, or at least the cruelty, in that kind of reactionary exclusion. A secondary recommendation — Miss Ruki as an asexual equivalent to Pusztai’s Jucika! Light-hearted, responsive capers, once again offering affirmation through difference in conviction. She and Jucika would be penpals, I think. Mal Maywood’s Cliff & Father Eugene, Instagram This is not a finished comic, or a three-block narrative. Cliff & Father Eugene exist on Maywood’s instagram and Patreon, and on Tapas; very short episodes, moments captured. It’s the warmth, though—there’s such a gentle, dogeared masculinity present, like a leather wingback rubbed to a shine — it’s the tenderness of rendering and narrative choice combined with fridge-like solidity in build that reminds me of men from storybooks I read as a child. Gabrielle Vincent’s Ernest, or Raymond Briggs’ comfortable, cheeky adults: the worn-in, tired loveliness cues you that this combination of young gay parishioner and old gay priest is supposition rather than argument — what if everything could be alright? Well. What if? World Within the World, Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics As mentioned, alchemically firming. The Perfect Mistake, Yev Yanko, Instagram Also not a finished work to any degree, also available mainly via Instagram, The Perfect Mistake perfectly represents the comics I want to be reading every day, casually, easily: psychologically-driven horny bad-person romance, drawn deliciously with verve and dashing conviction and texture. If you like Baldur’s Gate, Yanko has additional content you may enjoy. The Stone Cold General & the Maid Perplexed by his Burning Passion, Iruka Bando & Youka Koinada, MangaPlaza Beautiful, refined, operatic lifework with real commitment to character and costume design, over a framework of straight-faced yet devious world building and narrative design. It’s great and in my opinion socially healthy to see straight-laced, kind, thoughtful and serious characters give each other emergency handjobs without this being dismissed as either a gag or emotionally inconsequential. Plus-Sized Misadventures in Love, mamakari, MangaPlaza Cute and funny and DEMANDING. If you find yourself troubled by the returning onslaught of thinspo, take shelter here. What if I Feel Pretty was good? Like really good. Show It To Me Baby!, Keiko Hagiwara, MangaPlaza MangaPlaza hosts a plethora of “adult romance” comics, which means sex-forward visuals and very involved sound effects — amongst them are some of strong narrative quality. Show It To Me, Baby! is an example which pursues the tentative, creeping, insecure and self-sabotaging internal yearn of career-women’s-problems romance classics like You’re My Pet without assuming that the directly sexual must come later in the story. *** (articles) (top) Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) I read a few Gilbert Hernandez graphic novels I’d previously skipped this year — Marble Season, Bumperhead, Love From The Shadows -—and while they were all great, Life Drawing reaffirmed why Jaime is my guy. The culmination of plot threads begun in Tonta and Is This How You See Me, Life Drawing splits its focus intergenerationally, attending to both the aging members of the established cast and the fresh-faced youth introduced more recently. The tone feels wistful and melancholic in its sense of retrospect but also captures what it’s like to experience feelings for the first time, the combo stirring up depths of emotion constantly, even when it reads like Archie comics shenanigans, making for a reading experience that feels as profound as life itself. Misery Of Love, Yvan Alagbe (New York Review Comics) I bought a French edition of this a few years back, assuming it would never be translated, as the depictions of explicit sex that made such an immediate impression on a flip-through suggested a nonstarter for the book trade, and that each such image was a beautiful painting made it function as an art book even if the narrative were abstracted to me. Now that I can read Donald Nicholson-Smith’s translation, instead of my tentative fumblings with Google Translate, I can begin to suss out exactly how many feelings are contained within the bodies and expressions Alagbe renders so gorgeously. A reread of Alagbe’s Yellow Negroes helps to contextualize these passions within a more linear framework, but as much as I like that book’s stark black and white, the painterly washes of Misery Of Love are more appealing, while the story they suggest is shiftier, providing more to return to. (I should shout out NYRC’s collection of the works of Michael McMillan, Terminal Exposure, which is just really cool — his career begins with comics that serve as the historical connective tissue between the underground’s Kim Deitch and the later generation of Mark Beyer and Richard Sala, and then moves on from there to something that engages the undergrounds’ nostalgia for the visual culture of yesteryear to more personal-poetic ends than his peers.) Key Change, Miles MacDiarmid (self-published) There are cartoonists who do alright for themselves making comics about bad interactions with strangers at bars, or awkward interactions with roommates, but Miles MacDiarmid is unparalleled in his ability to write such scenes with a degree of specificity and comedic timing, so that readers understand what is charged about each scenario, while others coast on a reader’s sense of identification with a protagonist to say, “Ha ha, you get it,” before a joke is even attempted. You could call this “sitcom comics,” but MacDiarmid’s control of the page is closer to filmic than televisual: See the economy at which the first two pages of Key Change establish the premise and contextualize and explain the front cover, before we even get to the sequences of dialogue that escalate tension as the story goes on. MacDiarmid was a member of the Freak collective of comics-makers, and I must also mention issue 8 of Shaheen Beardsley’s Oboy, a series whose first six issues were collected alongside MacDiarmid’s The Hive: Coronation by Freak a few years ago. If most of the efforts of the younger generation of baffle and depress you, these are the sort of funny and well-drawn comics that will keep your enthusiasm for the medium going. Absolute Martian Manhunter, Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez (DC Comics) Credit editor-in-chief Marie Javins, because after years of mainstream comics being the worst they’ve ever been, DC has resumed putting out comics people actually want to read, with the Absolute line generating comic shop chatter. Even if you enjoyed issues of Al Ewing and Steve Lieber’s Metamorpho revival, it’s not hard to see why the Absolute line would connect with a larger, younger audience by abstaining from DC’s typical nostalgia for the 1960s. At least the sixties as manifested in silver age comics: Javier Rodriguez constructs a cartooning language in Absolute Martian Manhunter that employs the skill he’s honed as a colorist, designing his work for color to make for particularly bold, flowing page layouts that speak the argot of silkscreened psychedelic poster design in a way that can communicate to readers weaned on manga’s black and white pages. Deniz Camp provides the artist with a script to work with that’s not YA-brained garbage; characters move through these layouts with purpose and rhythm, telling a story with more on its mind than just IP rejuvenation. I’m taking one page’s description of a nuclear bomb screaming as a reference to Gravity’s Rainbow, while a plot point involving cookie poisoning seems to refer to both David Foster Wallace’s story “Mister Squishy” and how for decades the most famous bit of Martian Manhunter’s characterization was that Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis made him like eating Oreos. It’s hard for me to resist this combination of formalist cartooning brio and a sense of having read actual books, and it’s rare that it even comes up. Tongues Volume One, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) With congratulations comes a concomitant casting of blame: I suspect Absolute Wonder Woman, with its combination of strong drawing, elaborate layouts, and recasting of mythology, overshadowed Anders Nilsen’s Tongues, which did similar things, and I thought was certain to crossover to a mainstream fantasy-inclined audience. Tongues has a stately pace, years in the making, which Absolute Wonder Woman trades for the fast-moving continual escalation assembly-line-produced comics can afford, boosted in the attention economy by the presence of a beloved corporate trademark, coming off like the American remake compared to Nilsen’s European art film. Tongues is the greater accomplishment, simmering as the reader sinks into it, moving between plot threads it slowly braids together. Unfortunately, the 360-page Volume One feels like it just stops, rather than reaching an ending, with the climax and conclusion forthcoming in book two. While I’ll be there for the second collection of Absolute Wonder Woman when it’s out in February, (as well as checking out the collection of artist Hayden Sherman’s work on Batman: Dark Patterns), I’ll also be anticipating Tongues’ conclusion, likely to appear a decade from now, which indicates a staying power few artists can be bothered to be imbue their work with, in these days where the ambitions of art are flattened by the demand for content above all. *** (articles) (top) Girls Gone Wild #1 by Katie Lane (2d Cloud): Katie Lane’s comic has two sections; however, the Girls Gone Wild story has stayed with me more than any other comic I have read this year. Lane’s line feels drawn from life, as she collages moments into one. Lane’s dense, scratchy lettering is complemented by drawings that fill the page and capture perspectives in the quiet moments of conversations. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram): Big Gamble Rainbow Highway is filled with paranoid compact pages; each panel builds anxiety and paranoia. Myer’s ink-only line is expressive and fluid. The moments that break open and Myers’ drawing chops break out of the page’s confines are what made this one of my favorite comics of 2025. Key Change by Miles MacDiarmid (Self-Published): Key Change scratched an itch for me this year. I was a fan of MacDiarmid’s Hive from a few years back and was very excited about another venture into his character's world. Characters that MacDiarmid can make endearing and engaging within a page of their appearance. MacDiarmid’s ear for the interpersonal is translated into one of the most entertaining and funny reads of the year. Leone in “Blood from the Stone” and Other Stories by Max Burlingame (Cram): This year, I became obsessed with Max Burlingame’s mark-making. It would be easy to get lost in the hatching and patterns of any given panel if the story didn’t also propel the reader through its blood-obsessed world. Shout out to Cram for the excellent presentation of Burlingame’s work. *** (articles) (top) "I don’t even know if I like comics anymore," narrates Tara Booth at the start of her contribution to issue #54 of kuš!’s š! anthology. This year has been, as ever, an interesting one — between unrelated personal malaises and various industrial impediments (the final downfall of Diamond, for one), my reading has slowed down somewhat substantially. But now here I am, reminding myself that there is, in fact, some beauty left in the world of comics. And what better way to start than with — you guessed it — š! #54. I’m always quite fond of the guest-edited issues, and in this instance guest co-editor Caroline Cash delivers a strong showing, balancing kuš! favorites with a nice bit of shock to the Baltic system; of the latter category, Emma Hunsinger’s lesbian fantasy-drama and Leo Fox’s almost-Nabokovian narratorial play certainly stand out. Elsewhere, though I typically don’t tend to sort by publishers in these write-ups, New York Review Comics continue to be perhaps the single most vital curatorial line we have in our little Anglosphere. Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé is one of the most moving instances of form-following-function that I’ve encountered yet, while Miss Ruki is just about the platonic ideal of a crowd pleaser that still manages to please; Michael McMillan’s Terminal Exposure, meanwhile, subverts the common taboo-busting narrative of first-generation underground comix by looking outwards, both artistically and physically, for inspiration. (A special mention likewise goes to The Complete C Comics, which is a beautiful achievement of archiving in itself but which I have yet to read in its entirety; ditto Dash Shaw and R. Kikuo Johnson’s collection of Rea Irvin’s The Smythes, which I was hoping to read by the time of this write-up, but, alas, life gets in the way.) Outside of NYRC, too, we got two quite monumental reprint releases courtesy of Fantagraphics: World within the World is the long-overdue Julia Gfrörer shorts collection we’ve all been jonesing for (all of us with taste, anyway), while the archival Night Drive by Richard Sala serves as a beautiful road-map to the late great cartoonist’s restless career. The return of Anders Nilsen with the first collected volume of Tongues (Pantheon) and the first book of Linnea Sterte’s A Garden of Spheres (Peow2) proved a surprising complement, both of them focusing, through a genre-inflected lens, on that apocalyptic storm looming on the horizon and the beings charged, for better or worse, with bringing it forth. For Nilsen, this comes with some surprising divergences from his usual form (full coloring, for one; a much heavier narrative bent, for another); in Sterte’s book (which, in the interest of full disclosure, I had the pleasure of proofreading part of, for its self-published serialization), the cartoonist appears fully in her wheelhouse, with a charmingly-languorous approach to world-building in the vein of Angélica Gorodischer. Elsewhere, Michael DeForge (keep an eye out for my interview with him sometime in the new year) and Kayla E. both used life experience as a launchpad. For DeForge, the launchpad is a narrative one, as Holy Lacrimony (Drawn & Quarterly) draws — in part, and irreducibly—on DeForge’s own struggles to further that thematic fixture, the authenticity of human connection; Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish (Fantagraphics), meanwhile, draws on comics history as a mechanism of aesthetic detachment (and emotional repression) in a frenzy to clean that which cannot be cleansed. The first issue of Joe Walsh’s The Shifting Ground (self-published) offered a similar aesthetically-driven take on autobio, marrying the textural directness of Frank Santoro with the cogitative digressions of Kevin Huizenga, while Nick Bunch’s How to Stop Smoking Cigarettes (Cram) saw Bunch venture ever deeper into textural frenetics while still maintaining a beautifully vivid and immediately-intuitive grasp on flow and legibility. In what must, for want of a better term, be termed “literary fiction,” two more of comics’ finest observers of human interaction returned this year: Lee Lai’s second long-form outing, Cannon (Drawn & Quarterly) is a mental spiral in the truest sense of the term, running in all directions with painful clarity; Carol Swain’s three-piece revue Another Way Out (Dark and Golden) takes a more sedate approach, forcing its readers to do their own mental and inferential calculus. And what of the future? This year saw the release of three striking books by cartoonists entirely new to me: Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy (Drawn & Quarterly) merges a distinct strain of the D&Q lineage, from Seth to DeForge, with ruminations on the intersection of political and personal; Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles) offers up some beautiful anti-adventure stories; and Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram) packs both an emotional rattle and a graphic one. Maybe I do like comics, narrates Tara Booth at the end of her š! #54 contribution. Ain’t that just the way. Until next year … *** (articles) (top) For someone whose one and only lasting dream job is writing a workplace sitcom starring members of the circa-1987 Defenders, I fell off superhero comics hard in 2024. I've drifted away from the genre for years, mostly on account of basic growing up, but this year, absolutely nothing clicked. Friends and colleagues insist that a lot of quality cape books came out in the last year, and I'm sure they're right; in fact, you can probably read all about them in this very article. But the few times I tried, I just couldn't stick with it. Maybe the whole idea of reading about imaginary heroism when we live in a time of such complete lack of courage leaves me flat. Maybe I'm just being old. Regardless, it wasn't hard to pick ten great ones from a year where culture so often failed us. I struggle to find a common theme: In many ways, it found me looking back at the great creators of the last few decades, but maybe that's simple nostalgia. But maybe it's also thinking of one's self as increasingly part of the past, as the future becomes something that feels all used up. A thread of something ending, even to just transform into something else with or without you, runs through it, of history as a nightmare from which we are forever haunted. These are ten I won't easily forget. Insectopolis: A Natural History, Peter Kuper (W.W. Norton & Company) The insect apocalypse has been much on my mind this year, and I'm not alone. In his latest, Peter Kuper asks: What if it already happened? What if the insects studied us the way we once studied them? And what if ... it really wasn't all that bad, after all? Kuper's wild, whimsical history of the relationship between man and bug is informative, entertaining, expertly constructed, funny, tragic, and addictive, everything a comic by a real pro should be. Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) It is often a conflict when praising the work of an established talent in the comics world: Are you praising them because of excellence or because of familiarity? Luckily for all of us, Jaime Hernandez leaves no space between them: these stories, with seemingly only the thread of the complicated dynamic between Tonta and Maggie between them, ultimately cohere with a shimmering unity that matches his tremendous draftsmanship, seemingly getting better every year, to a tee. The Mongoose, Joana Mosi (Pow Pow Press) One of the best meditations on grief that I've read in a decade, The Mongoose, with its deceptively simple black-and-white line art and its expanses of silence, reminded me of nothing on first encounter as much as the late Chantal Akerman's masterful Jeanne Dielman. Only the presence of a playful, ominous, and possibly imaginary mongoose keeps its head above the clouds, but the combination is transcendent: sad, funny, smart, meaningful, and with quiet, stunning emotional power. More Weight: A Salem Story, Ben Wickey (Top Shelf Productions) At times like this, when it's easy to believe this country was doomed from the start, it's almost trite to praise a book that so convincingly makes that very argument, hitting a large and prominent nail right on the head with the story of a group of puritanical fanatics that start looking for a special scapegoat. Wickey's canny art, the elegance of which skates right up to the edge of the grotesque, makes More Weight the complete package, the most successful combination of art and story of the year. Muybridge, Guy Delisle [Helga Dascher & Rob Aspinall, translators] (Drawn & Quarterly) Artists in every medium have been drawn to retell the story of Eadweard Muybridge. And why not? He practically invented the modern conception of a moving picture, and it's no surprise that someone as curious and capable as Guy Delisle would want to take another crack at him. Muybridge's life was almost too eventful to comprehend, but Delisle draws the heart of the man and his work out at just the right moments, his clean and expressive lines providing perfect framing for his subject's genius. Nocturnos, Laura Pérez, translated by Andrea Rosenberg (Fantagraphics) The most powerful and effective treatment of the menacing nature of nighttime since Roger Ekirch's At Day's Close, Pérez's new graphic novel establishes that the dark hours are just as full of mystery as they ever were. With nebulous art that throbs with the same eerie energy that infuse the stories, it's a series of vignettes that have the same incomprehensible logic of an inescapable dream. The use of color may be the most effective of any book I read in 2025. The Once and Future Riot, Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Joe Sacco has been on an absolutely Olympian tear of late. More productive than he's ever been, he's also honed his visuals to a razor's edge, and the clarity and the insightfulness of his approach has proven itself crucial to the moment. This gorgeously limned account of the Uttar Pradesh riots in India over a decade ago, it reverberates into the present with undeniable demands about the nature of violence, how we know what we know, and the bloody ways in which those things connect. The Past is a Grotesque Animal, Tommi Parrish (Fantagraphics) The tumbling, ranging nature of Tommi Parrish's sumptuous work about identity, relationships, sexuality, and just about everything else under the sun wouldn't shine the way it does without its exquisite visuals, with their vibrant shifting painted surfaces, but it doesn't have to. The combination leaves us with a shockingly intimate creation, like walking through a stranger's house and learning more about them in every room. A vital piece of trans art at a time it is desperately needed. Salt Green Death, Katarina Thorsen (Conundrum Press) A historical reconstruction, an intricate mystery, and an investigation of the way we are harmed and helped by the people meant to have care of us, Thorsen's book — composed of masterful waves of shifting colored pencils that fit its historical period magnificently — tells the story of a disturbed man named Joseph O'Dwyer's life-altering encounters with the psychiatric system of Canada in the postwar years. It's a tremendous piece of work, making a small story resonate into much greater meaning. Tongues, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon Books) When I first encountered Anders Nilsen's riveting retelling of the myth of Prometheus, brought squalling into Afghanistan in the 21st century, I thought it was instantly one of the most memorable things I'd seen in a long while. Time and repeat reading has not disabused me of that belief. There is unexpected depth in the portrayal of its archetypical characters, and its honeycomb structures mirror each other and reflect its themes of language and history with precision and intricacy. HONORABLE MENTION Black Cohosh, Eagle Valiant Brosi (Drawn & Quarterly) Calavera, P.I., Marco Finnegan (Oni Press) Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) Drome, Jesse Lonergan (23rd St.) Gaza in My Phone, Mazen Kerbaj (OR Books) The Giant: Orson Welles, the Artist and the Shadow, Youssef Daoudi (23rd St.) Holy Lacrimony, Michael DeForge (Drawn & Quarterly) In the End We All Die, Tobias Aeschbacher [Andrew Shields, translator] (Helvetiq) John Muir: To the Heart of Solitude, Lomig (NBM Publishing) Lovers and Haters, Gilbert Hernandez (Fantagraphics) The Magnificent Adventure, Milo Manara (Fantagraphics) The Murder Next Door: A Graphic Memoir, Hugh D'Andrade (Street Noise Books) The Pit, Erik Kriek (Living the Line) Simplicity: A Novel, Mattie Lubchansky (Pantheon Books) World within the World: The Collected Short Comix 2010-2022, Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2024 was a terrific year for the medium, with new releases by greats like Olivier Schrauwen, Rick Altergott, Maurice Vellekoop, Emil Ferris, Peter Bagge, Dash Shaw, and many others (not to mention a bumper crop of books by Charles Burns). Could this year possibly live up to it? Well, pretty much. Although some long-awaited projects (like Jay Stephens’ Figgy Furthermore and the fifth volume of D&Q’s Yoshiharu Tsuge series) got pushed back to 2026, there was more than enough to make up for it. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed everything listed below, and could have included many more if time (and space) allowed. So, in no particular order … Tongues, Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) Surely this will be on many people’s lists. Superbly written, beautifully illustrated, and charged with a lightning crackle of dry humor, this bold reimagining of the story of Prometheus weaves three separate narratives into a complex (and timely) meditation on the present state of humanity. Nilsen’s most ambitious project yet, its visual inventiveness never lets up for a second, every page bursting with ideas that can sometimes barely be contained, but which never seem superfluous. To say it’s the work of a Promethean talent would just be too obvious. But I’ve done it now, so what the hell. World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) From a distance, this beautifully presented volume looks like some long-forgotten collection of obscure fairy tales. The scary kind. And that seems appropriate, as some pretty horrible things happen within its pages. But no matter how grim they get, it’s impossible to look away from these utterly compelling tales of human misery, which are infused with a dark eroticism and flashes of pitch-black humor. Although recalling at times the work of Eddie Campbell, Tony Millionaire, or early Chester Brown, Gfrörer’s work remains utterly unique, the product of a fiercely intelligent cartoonist who isn’t afraid to stare into the abyss. Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) One of the best reissues of the year. Fantagraphics did an exemplary job resurrecting this early gem by the late Richard Sala (all but impossible to find in its original form), expanding the original self-published comic into a handsome hardcover designed by Daniel Clowes and rounding it out with a lengthy introduction and several previously unpublished pages. A delightfully eccentric mélange of gothic noir, Universal monster films, and the surreal serial epics of Louis Feuillade, it had everything you could want from this irreplaceable master of the macabre. The Weight by Melissa Mendes (Drawn & Quarterly) Ten years in the making, it was wonderful to see this sprawling coming-of-age tale finally published in a single volume. Loosely based on a memoir written by her grandfather, Mendes has crafted a brutal, but deeply moving and occasionally uplifting story that delves deep into the messy, confusing business of being alive. Epic in scope, but intimate in design, the whole book is a masterclass in cartooning. Deftly paced and using minimal dialogue, Mendes relies on subtle shifts in facial expression and body language to communicate a whole range of emotions, while layers of ink wash bring a richness of depth and texture to the everyday details of mid-century rural America that drip from every page. Another Way Out by Carol Swain (Dark & Golden Books) After more than a decade of silence, the prospect of any new material from Carol Swain had begun to seem very distant indeed, so the sudden appearance of this comic from UK-based Dark & Golden Books came as a welcome surprise. Featuring two previously unpublished stories and an extract from a forthcoming graphic novel (more good news!), it was a perfect showcase for her atmospheric pencil and charcoal drawings, and dreamlike, mysterious tales which seem both eerily familiar and one step removed from the world we know. It was like she’d never been away. Beat It, Rufus by Noah Van Sciver (Fantagraphics) One of the most prolific cartoonists working right now, it seems almost surprising that Noah Van Sciver has only released one new book this year. But that one was an absolute treat. Mining similar territory to his beloved Fante Bukowski series, this tale of a washed-up musician who heads out on a desperate, drug-fueled road trip was another perfectly observed study of the delusional but ever-optimistic losers in which he’s specialized for more than a decade. Very funny and oddly moving, it’s a paean to those people who, for better or worse, just can’t stop dreaming. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) You’d think enough had been written about the Mitford sisters over the years, but this captivating book somehow managed to make the story of Nancy, Diana, Unity, et al. seem fresh again. It helped that it wasn’t just a straight biography, but a beautifully designed and exquisitely drawn account of the spell these eccentric and quintessentially English characters cast over Pond when she was a young girl growing up in Southern California. Without letting up for a second, she combines their individual stories into a single dizzying narrative, told with a kind of dry humor that would have made its subjects proud. Tedward (Fantagraphics) and Pleasure Beach #1 (Self-Published) by Josh Pettinger It’s been a good year for Pettinger, with a complete collection of everybody’s favorite “Old Fashioned Guy” hitting the shelves alongside the first issue of what looks like being his most ambitious series yet. Both blend moments of laugh-out-loud humor with nightmarish undercurrents that give them a real emotional weight. The first issue of Pleasure Beach reads like an anxiety-ridden fever dream about returning to the place you grew up. But with several different plot strands already up in the air, we can only wait and see where the story might be going. War Epic #3 by Nathan Cowdry (Self-Published) Cowdry apparently had a hard time completing this third installment of his self-described "epic," which might not bode well for its future. But we can only hope that he finds a way of moving forward, as this tale of a Nazi camp commandant attempting to mount a production of Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard with his unfortunate prisoners is one of the funniest, weirdest books out there at the moment. Although wrong on so many levels, it never feels like Cowdry is just doing this for the shock value, and it’s been a real pleasure watching his already considerable talents improve from issue to issue. My Name is Shingo, Volumes 4&5 by Kazuo Umezz (Viz) Volumes 4 and 5 of this ongoing series take Umezz’s weirdly prescient tale of artificial intelligence gone wrong (through no real fault of its own) into increasingly bizarre and unhinged territory. What began as a seemingly innocent tale of young love has gradually shifted into a delirious meditation on humanity’s relationship with technology. By the end of volume 5, things are beginning to crack at the seams, the story operating at a frenzied pitch several notches above anything that could reasonably be described as rational (and no, that isn’t meant as a criticism). Volume 6 will be the last in the series, but how this will end is anybody’s guess. Being Alive by Simon Hanselmann (Instagram) After the disappointing news that Hanselmann’s zombie epic, You Will Own Nothing And You Will Be Happy, is on indefinite hiatus, Megg & Mogg fans were rewarded this summer with an unexpected treat. Serialized on Instagram à la 2020’s Crisis Zone, this was a rollercoaster ride of weird clown sex and unsanitary car-toilets, flowing with exemplary comic timing and packed with hilarious one-liners. It began by introducing unforgettable characters like Butts Farto and Potatoes O’Brien, and clmaxed with the most inappropriate birthday party you could ever hold for a 9-year-old, where one of the principal cast members was forced to give himself a long, hard look. The blend of outrageous humor and genuine pathos gave the ending an unexpected poignancy that made it feel like an instant classic. A print version should be on the way soon. The Smythes by Rea Irvin (NYRC) Perfectly timed to coincide with The New Yorker’s 100th anniversary, that venerable magazine’s first art editor is honored with a beautifully presented collection of his little-known 1930s newspaper strip. At first glance a sort of elegant cross between Frank King and Crockett Johnson (although a bit too early for the latter, I know), a closer look reveals something entirely his own. The Smythes was a light-hearted satire of social pretension with a refined, Art Deco aesthetic that stood apart from many of his more boisterous contemporaries, and this is a wonderful introduction, ably curated by Dash Shaw, R. Kikuo Johnson, and Caitlin McGurk. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life by Dan Nadel (Scribner) Of course, this isn’t a comic as such, but it has to be included anyway. An in-depth biography of the father of Underground Comix was long overdue, and Nadel unquestionably did the project justice, producing a well-researched and critically astute study that delved deep into Crumb’s work and background, exploring the personal, political, and social realities that shaped his monumental oeuvre. Packed with fascinating details (Leonard Cohen almost wrote the introduction to Head Comix!?), and not afraid to take its subject to task when necessary, it will surely stand as the definitive account for many years to come. And if time allowed… Goes Like This by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics), Crickets #9 by Sammy Harkham (Self-Published), Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith (Abrams), Red Night and Light of the Moon & Other Stories by Hanawa Kazuichi (Breakdown Press/Mansion Press), Holy Lacrimony by Michael DeForge (D&Q), Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, Lorenzo Mattotti & David Mazzucchelli (Pantheon), Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (D&Q), Barnaby, Volume 5 by Crockett Johnson (Fantagraphics), The Art of Milt Gross, Volume 1 by Paul C. Tumey (Erratic Press), The Cabbie, Vols. 1&2 by Marti (Fantagraphics), The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books), Alienation: Final Cut by Inés Estrada (Floating World), Brain Damage by Shintaro Kago (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a hell of a time. The year in which America descended into a fascist government also turned out to be the strongest year for comics in recent memory, and certainly in the time I’ve been writing about them. Who knows: maybe that old canard about bad times producing good art might have something to it after all. In any case, a brief listing of some of the year’s superlatives: Most Cascading Dominos Due to an Industry Bankruptcy: Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. Seediest Self-Immolation of a Longstanding Comics Institution: Angoulême Comics Festival Best Republication of a Near-Forgotten Manga Classic: Drawn and Quarterly’s new collection of Shirato Sanpei’s The Legend of Kamui Most Predictable Aborted Retirement From Superhero Comics: Grant Morrison Most Alarming Looming Possibility for Corporate Interference: David and Larry Ellison’s bid to purchase DC Comics owner Warner Bros. Discovery. Five Best Books of 2025 The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco. Sacco’s latest (and supposedly last, for a time) work of journalistic cartooning is also his best since 1996’s Palestine. It’s also an unexpectedly relevant, if not to say prophetic, commentary on the nature of violence and democracy in action. My pick for the best book of the year. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond. Speaking of unexpectedly relevant commentaries on fascist eras. Mimi Pond’s vibrant, funny biography of the celebrated British sisters is more joyous and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pond has been working for decades, mostly under the radar, but if this is the book that finally makes hers a name to reckon with it will be well-earned. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore. Passmore’s passionate, unflinching look at a century of revolutionary defiance against racial oppression is often grim but never bleak: its underlying theme is one of hope, and a confidence that silence is the one thing no amount of tyranny or apartheid can ever fully achieve. Boy, I do seem to be going heavy on the historical nonfiction this year, don’t I? Maybe it’s the tenor of the times. Better liven things up with something fanciful. Batman and Robin: Year One by Mark Waid and Chris Samnee. Am I cheating by shoehorning a mainstream superhero comic onto this list? Absolutely. Is it legitimately better, on an objectively literary level, than, say, World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer or Tedward by Josh Pettinger, both of which my arbitrary cap of five entries prevented me from including? It is not. But it was as delightful and true a distillation of the mainstream superhero ethos as one could hope for; Mark Waid (having been unleashed at last on his proper home of DC Comics after a decade in exile) is at the top of his game; and Chris Samnee remains an artist incapable of making an unnecessary pencil stroke. I liked it. Existential Comics: Selected Stories 1979-2004 by R. Crumb. Like most sensible critics, I have ambivalent feelings about Robert Crumb. His new floppy of original material this year, Tales of Paranoia, was a reminder of the sort of unreconstructedly retrograde and paranoid worldview Crumb has always embodied (his continued adherence to anti-vax conspiracies was, alas, predictable). But this Dan Nadel-edited collection of some of Crumb’s most outstanding comics is a reminder of the other side of that personality — the originality, lack of apology, and phenomenal artistic versatility that has always made R. Crumb inimitable in his field. The book is wonderful and troubling, as an underground ought to be. *** (articles) (top) Paul Jon Milne / Suture At first sight I thought, “won't get arsed by Milne throwing out a comic with a flying v(agina) flanged upon”, but I confused it with an angelic shape, which avowedly happens a lot to me. The author's topping last year's triple efforts of Creep Heap 2025, Limit Formation Initial, and These Aren't My Brutes, with his telling of an epic of Frankensteinian proportions, wherein a creature might suffer alone by getting its parts together. Palpable the pain it went through when being subject to crazy bio engineers trying to conquer soil they're not rooted in, empathized on the total alienation felt, while following fascinated a setting staged in a way only Milne is capable of, thanks to his unique graphic skills powering his narration. Furthermore I was dead sure he created the impressive coloring with crayons, but he corrected me, when I asked him on Bluesky about it: “the 'big' pages were often coloured with felt pens or acrylic paint, or both, but the bulk of it's mostly just flat photoshop colours. I liked using felt pens, they were my favourite pages. They run out fast though, would like to colour a whole comic with them at some point but I need to buy more ... used too-bright lightbox for the felt pen layers, which often didn't give me a clear impression of the colours or the shapes at all, so I just winged it and had fun, and I liked the results.” Such is Paul, a modest and gentle man. Ingrīda Pičukāne / Feminae Explorarum (kuš!) A fascinating collection of former published musings on fashion, colors, and French (the language), where women do what they're supposed to do: not suffering, picking mushrooms while moving through the woods like they're catwalking a fashion editorial, sending drunkards to a voyage on a river like Frankenstein's creature was about to do before Whale had to cut it out, flooding the world with rivers of menstrual blood, and so on. James Corcoran / Stramash 63 (self-published, Kickstarter) Hard knocks, but are you ruff enuff, dog lovers? This is a kind of sequel to the first three Stramash issues, and the plotting does plant the evil that men do in different ages, but bloodshed knows no history, except for chronicler James Corcoran, with support on colo(u)rs by Colin Bell. If you're into PI stuff, the classic way, but with a sense of wonder, this is your joint. The broad-brush henchmen in this are overtly ghastly, just sayin. Deniz Camp, Javier Rodríguez / Absolute Martian Manhunter (National Periodical) Vertigo'd: Right now I have no knowledge of any series that's pulling the rug from under your feet in a more effective way, and I dunno why you have to resurrect a label like Vertigo – which should be left dead for good – especially, if your portfolio features series like AMM, the fantastic Kryptonite Spectrum mini by the Ice Cream Man weirdos, or what Zatannic Panic could've been, if it would've went more in the body horror direction the Plastic Man story featured solely chose. Gerry Duggan, Kelvin Mao, Robert Windom, Jae Lee, June Chung / This Ends Tonight (Image) Three's a charm, or three story lines being interwoven while colliding at different time stamps: And I say Bill Everett's the forefather or -mother to Jae Lee's Namor and ~ita plus everything that followed. Just check the faces of the submariner and especially the fighting girls portrayed by Everett every now and then and compare those to the protas in This Ends Tonight, the energy generated by the artwork is of a kinetic kind rarely seen elsewhere, maybe in L'Intervista by Manuele Fior, or La Guerre by Thomas Cadène and Loïc Sécheresse. From a majority of the team that brought you Seven Sons. Liam Sharp et al /The Savage Sword of Conan #8 (Titan) Sharp as a sword: Like in the days of Doré, Foster, or Raymond, magazine's like that are the main justification for print's existence, because digital does the stellar artwork of one Liam Sharp no justice at all. Its overwhelming effect is reminiscent of that time when you were opening your first Planet of The Apes mag to discover Mike Ploog's and Tom Sutton's filigree black and white contributions to Terror On The Planet Of The Apes, and of course, and because it's so obvious, we'll have to squeeze Barry Windsor-Smith in here, too. There's a full issue done by Sharp, the eleventh, but I didn't manage to read it by now, because I have a life. But I bet it's overwhelming. Various / Back Issue #157: Keith Giffen tribute (TwoMorrows Publications) Excerpt from an interview, that drove me to tears: CADIGAN: Was that the one time in your career when you put your heart and soul into your work more so than any other? GIFFEN: I always try to throw 100 percent of myself into the work, but I guess the Legion thing, there was a little bit more in there, a little bit more in terms of what I really wanted to do in terms of storytelling and tone in a book. Yeah, I guess that was. Out of all the work I'd done for DC up until that point, yeah, Legion was the book that I put that little bit of extra into-the "Five Years Later." Lina Müller, Luca Schenardi / Plant Based Monster Trucks (Nieves) The one wherein I asked the question “Now, what's your stance on comics”, and identified as a latitudinarian. Yvan Alagbé / The Midnight Traveler ; Le Voyageur (Èditions Adverse) An excerpt from an upcoming meditation on the colonial phantoms still ruling over white minds: “That for his 2025 release The Midnight Traveler Yvan Alagbé chose the most odd of all the otherwise loincloth-sporting gents, who, if not dressed in a costume, obviously goes by the name of Kit Walker, might be due to the myth behind the seemingly immortal man, because the Phantom job gets passed on from father to son when cracking with old age. Le Voyageur, an essayist pamphlet leporello initially created for the Italian edition of Yellow Negroes, or, as the legend goes, *hidden in it*, and republished just this autumn by one of the French publishing houses most dedicated to the art of bookbindery, Éditions Adverse, presents jungle plagiarism and fumetti neri italiani pastiche galore, a meta-textual retelling of the relationships between black and white, readable as an allegory on the depiction of people of color still held hostage in territories of white fantasy. 't was created by a certain Démoniak, who also published a four part mini series named Eros negro (jouer avec le feu), which translates as Black Desire (Playing with Fire).” sleepyhouse2 / hard core drugs (self-published, online) The online cmcs dept. update for 2025: Maxim Peter Griffin continues to run on full steam, while Tym Godek's motor seemingly started stuttering a bit, but nonetheless provided us with insights on the dynamics developing between love and charismARTic, as did Derek M. Ballard on the daily fight of a bringing-up father; the latter both having new print manifestations on their hands; Tym Godek at Domino, and Dr. Ballard at Adventure Time. MEANWHILE, sleepyhouse2 entered the scene. Her web comic hard core drugs, running on Bluesky and Tumblr – as every good comic should – visually evokes a German comic strip series from the 1950s, Manfred Schmidt's Nick Knatterton, a parody intentionally born out of its creator's wishes to drag the idiocy of comics into the limelight after reading an issue of Superman, but unfortunately spotlighted said idiocy in such brightness, that soon it began to outshine the stars, and finally became one itself. Add some Clamp-influenced manga shizzle, ca. Clover, to the concept, and you get a drug dramedy of its very own kind, by diving into the realms of addiction and self-exploitation. But what I love the most about it, is its recurring use of German and Yiddish, the latter in a kinship with the German language, which makes the association with Nick Knatterton a tad obvious, nicht wahr? *** (articles) (top) 1. Monsieur Chouette, David B, L'Association This is a tale about the nature of fear, the imagination and the afterlife. It's also the best thing David B has done since Epileptic. BUT: After 35 years, the trailblazing L'Association risks extinction due to production/transport costs, the squeeze on indie bookstores and the huge amount of well-publicized competition from big BD publishers. I urge you to join as a member (benefits include a discount their on their 800+ work catalogue, which gave you Epileptic, Persepolis and Emmanuel Guibert's Alan's War). Or just make a small contribution here. 2. Béla sans monde, Simon Roussin, Editions 2042 Roussin is one of today's most original artists. This is psychedelia beyond psychedelia, with poetic storytelling and specially-printed, fluorescent pages. Gorgeous and hallucinatory. 3. An Illustrated Treasury of Russian Curses, Ass Edition (жопа), Pollard & Kuznetsova Canadian cartoonist Jess Pollard and journalist Elmira Kuznetsova turn мат, Russia's age-old art of cursing into English counterparts with matching cartoons. Their work is now a globally popular, five-book series. (I'm a Russian student, but you don't have to be.) All volumes come as E-books; not recommended for kids, unless they're kids who want to shock immigrant parents. In 2026, also look for Pollard's upcoming It's Just Crabs, "a tragic tale of crab evolution". 4. Le repaire de la Meduse, Brecht Evens, Actes Sud BD/ Musée Thomas Henry The French/English catalogue of a museum show (the cover unfolds into a two-sided artwork) that featured Evens' work with Atelier Michael Woolworth. In it, the artist discusses visual language, his artistic partnership and different forms of printing, alongside special pages from his exceptional, ongoing Le Roi Meduse ("The Jellyfish King"). 5. Marseille tatouée ("Marseille tattooed"), group work, Éditions Fotokino A great idea, beautifully executed by some favorite folks: Annabelle Perrin, Nine Antico, Bonnefrite, Cagne Canine and Simon Roussin. Artists asked residents of Marseille about their tattoos, then drew the speakers. A special mention also for Nine Antico's 2025 album Une Obsession (Dargaud). 6. L'Enquete qui Pietinait ("The Stalled Investigation"), Benoit Jacques, Benoit Jacques Books A 32-page parody of a police procedural in the simple form of a newsprint paper. Matchless silliness and hilarity from of my all-time favorite artists. Helped make my year. 7. Smoke Signals, Gary Panter, Desert Island, Brooklyn Another newsprint gem; more people should be drawing and printing these! Newsprint has a great comic history; use it more! 8. Vu de L'Atlantique, Serge Clerc, Éditions Barbier L'Atlantic is one of several bars Clerc frequented during a couple of difficult years. This contains his sketchbook from the time, with everything he sketched and overheard. All the art is in his signature angular, retro style and page 180 has one of the best bar stories I've ever heard. 9. Signé Coco, Les Arènes, Corinne "Coco" Rey A nice fat collection of cartoons by Coco, a true pioneer (and not because of her sex). Organized by theme and containing the Charlie Hebdo cover Coco drew after the Nov. 13 massacres: the spirit of French cartooning in an image. 10. Les Oiseaux, Noam Courtois, Brigitte Boulent Editions 2025 Noam, who was seven-and-a-half during the Covid quarantine, kept himself occupied by drawing birds. This is a collection of them published by his grandmother. No one sees like kids. *** (articles) (top) Res ipsa loquitur “Cast” (Hagai Palevsky, Aaron Losty, Marissa Louise, Claire Napier, Self-Published). A wind-up gag, the type of joke in which the build-up to the punchline becomes the actual subject, is very hard to do right; it requires a dozen tiny variations on the same thing, a slow rising of the stakes, each one functioning as a joke by itself. “Cast” is a near-perfect example of such a gag, building its sixteen pages ever upwards until one almost reaches the heaven (that is both figurative and literal in this case) Last Summer at Camp Righteous (Ollie Hicks, Good Comics). A continuation of Hicks’ usual themes (Americana, religious hypocrisy, fucking) that never fail to entertain. There’s a knife-edge balance to these characters, who can both caricatures and people at the same time. Nap Comix (Rachel Smith, self-published). Kids say the darndest things. Crickets #9 (Sammy Harkham, Breakdown Press). The best part of Blood of the Virgin was the cowboy actor story (the one in color); so it’s nice to see Harkham surrendering to popular demand and doing another cowboy story in living color. This issue starts in a more traditional manner before going to Looney Tunes territory for its (extremely long, extremely satisfying) climax. No need to read any previous entries, or even follow the plot that heard, just sit back and enjoy world-class cartooning. Judge Dredd: And To the Sea Return (Rob Williams, Henry Flint, Annie Parkhouse, Rebellion). I wasn’t quite as keen on this story as some of the previous Judge Dredd "epics" (which are thankfully still rather short), never the most subtle of strips but he can certainly make the implicit into the explicit one time too many. Still … any excuse to see Henry Flint make another showcase of himself. You find yourself wondering why the American market didn’t try to poach him and thankful he isn’t misused on some terrible superhero story. A rare talent that started great and just keeps getting better. “Duke Ellington on Mars” (Michael D. Kennedy, Drawn &amp; Quarterly). The rest of Kennedy’s 2025 collection of comics, Milk White Steed, swings between ‘very good’ to ‘very very good’ but this short story is outright great. Pure comics poetry, as ridiculous as it is sublime. Red Night (Hanawa Kazuichi, translated by Ryan Holmberg, Breakdown Press). This book is gross, sick, violent, pornographic, morally reprehensible, visually nauseating, intellectually confused, physically painful (it gave me a paper cut) … god help me, I loved it. Legend of Kamui (Shirato Sanpei, translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, Alexa Frank, Drawn and Quarterly). Shirato Sanpei’s massive historical saga seems like the stuff cliches are made of, but it is simply because you are looking at the pure source of these cliches. And, of course, everything that you think you know of historical manga, the kind that glorified battle and the bravery of the samurai, is best forgotten about. Sanpei casts his net wide as he chronicles the life of the rich and the poor, the noble and the worker, the great and the small … the only weakness one could point to is that the net is sometimes too wide — with the cast of characters becoming as complex as that of a Tolstoy novel. Would that all works would make such complaints necessary. “Zorn’s Lemma” (Chloe, self-published). A new work by Chloe that is like a Jazz standard run through the thematic obsession of an early grindcore album. Not sure if its aiming at John Zorn but it is the closest a comic book (or probably any other non-music medium) came close to aping the sensation of listening to Naked City for the first time. World Within the World: Collected Minicomix and Short Works 2010-2022 (Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics). The most striking things about this collection is: a) that Julia Gfrörer is only with us since 2010, since the impact of her work is so crushing you just assume she'd been there long before; B) even when doing stuff that reads like a typical webcomics gag (what is Fraser met Akira?) her pencils and attitude give the whole thing a sharp sensation that raises above the obviousness of the gag. That’s her work, a small knife so sharp you fail to notice you’ve been stabbed until you look down and see the pool of blood. *** (articles) (top) As I write this it is nearly Christmas 2025. This year, like every year, I look back and get bad feelings in the pit of my stomach about all the books I didn’t read and all the cons I didn’t table. Then I get an email, asking me for my list of favorite reads of the year and I feel like a phony. I imagine a cartoonist Christmas office party, I am standing behind the monstera as much, as it allows, with any luck I won’t get noticed. Then I think of what I draw and realise that won’t happen. The following books are titles I read this year, which really spoke to me with their expressions of visceral existence, humanity, whimsy and draughtsmanship. I enjoyed them all very much. Help!, Ethan Llewellyn and Francis Todd, Self-Published Filth, Underground Kingdom Comix Anthology, artists: Mat Greaves, Vincent Bell, Robertson, @__Threesix, steven Harper, Olly telling, Struan Sloan, Matt Simmons, Adam Falp, covers: Ethan Llewellyn, Kai Reynolds, Harry Deane Willmott, Francis Todd Tedward, Josh Pettinger, Fantagraphics 2x, Carol Swain, Dark and Golden Books The Devil’s Grin Book One, Alex Graham, Fantagraphics Astorial Compendium of Short Stories featuring Tamblyn the Secret Architect, Ed Pinsent, Self Published Worms, Book the Second, Erika Price, self published I will now release my koala death grip on the monstera, tell myself I can be a normal person who talks to folks; I did read some great work this year and table at some lovely places. I am VERY lucky to be in such great company and have their work in my life. *** (articles) (top) Punica Fides. A new book by one of the greatest Italian artists active today. It tells the story of a city in ruins, where the population is fighting in a never-ending conflict within itself and with the authorities. Bruno’s imagery is intense and dark, soaked in dense black inks. Bruno is a pure comic artist, one who never compromises his vision. The JoJolands. Many years after the last time I read anything from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, this new installment brought me back to Hirohiko Araki’s work. He probably has already invented and done everything he had to, but after nine series the madness of this series and the super dynamic art is still so exhilarating. I’m collecting the Japanese edition, which looks beautiful. Penguin Gohan. In Your In Face Comix, a very courageous small Italian publisher has released a collection of short stories by Shigesato Itoi and Terry King, the master of heta-uma, and I couldn’t be happier. The craziest stuff you could ever come across, still looking so fresh and avant-garde after over 40 years. Still from the same publisher, I also had the chance to read a collection of shorts by Kazuichi Hanawa from the 70s, entitled Chiaro di Luna, who some may remember for his autobiographical Doing Time. His fiction is disturbing and deeply fascinating. Les moutons veulent du sel, a graphic novel by my friend Emanuele Cantoro, published in France by Ça et Là, tells the story of a child growing up on the outskirts of Rome who finds a form of salvation through nature and a flock of sheep. Cantoro’s art is spontaneous and strikingly fresh. Monsieur Chouette. The new graphic novel by Monsieur David B (in France by L’Association and in Italy by Sigaretten with the title Signor Civetta) is a wild, oneiric journey into the land of the dead, somewhere between the Divine Comedy and Alice in Wonderland. The book is a thick, visionary, funny, and unsettling experience. Takemitsu Zamurai and Nihon no Kyōdai. Two manga by Taiyo Matsumoto were published in Italy this year. Both are relatively old works and very different from each other. Takemitsu Zamurai (originally published in Japan between 2005 and 2009, in Italy by Edizioni BD/J-Pop Manga) is a slow, dreamlike samurai story with mesmerizing artwork, while Nihon no Kyōdai (in Italy by Coconino Press) is a collection of stories from the early 1990s that tell you what Matsumoto was going to become in the future and at the same time almost feel as if they could have appeared in Garo in the 1970s. My Friend Kim Jong Un, a thoroughly researched and very entertaining book on the history of the Korean Peninsula, confirms once again the talent of Keum Suk Gendry-Kim, one of the most brilliant cartoonists working today. I live how her comics can be so many things at the same time: funny, intelligent, grotesque, delicate, and so much alive, just like her smooth and fascinating art. I’ve read the Italian edition by Bao Publishing, while in France the book is available from Futuropolis and in English soon by Drawn & Quarterly. The short-story collection The Green Hand and Other Stories by Nicole Claveloux was finally published in Italian by Eris Edizioni (available in English by New York Review Comics, 2022), and a major exhibition dedicated to her work was held in my hometown, Bologna, during the A occhi aperti festival. Claveloux was part of the French comics new wave of the late 1970s and '80s, blending psychedelic atmospheres with highly technical, Topor-inspired drawing. Reading her work pushed me into a '70s trip, collecting old issues of classic French magazines like Charlie and, of course, Métal Hurlant. I also discovered the work of Lika Nüssli from Switzerland — amazing artist and wonderful person — and returned to old sentimental sports manga by Mitsuru Adachi, as well as early issues of Rumiko Takahashi’s Ranma ½. I’ve recently picked up the new Crickets by Sammy Harkham and Gary Panter’s Smoke Signal. I haven’t read the collection Tongues by Anders Nilsen (which I expect to see mentioned often on this page), just because I am already collecting the series (which I hope to see in Italy soon, hopefully translated by me, just like Big Questions). Toward the end of the year, Canicola delighted Italian readers with two books I had been eagerly waiting for: the dreamy and stylish Il sogno della cicala by Dario Sostegni and Raffaele Sorrentino, and Il bus incantato, a true story from Iran told by the very talented Majid Bita. And then, a big shout-out to all the good comics I forgot to mention. *** (articles) (top) Favorite books of 2025 … Frankly, I still have a huge pile of more than 30 unread books beside my bed! I also skipped talking about all the small press gems that I gathered this year in Montreal, Toronto and Rome. So here goes: a mixture of English and French, some familiar to the Comics Journal readership and some secret gems for the more curious and audacious readers out there. Books whose design and format transcend the norm; where the artist went further and farther to produce a cross between a graphic novel and an art book/object. These books are usually treasured for a long time and 2025 produced a lot. Goes Like This, Jordan Crane, Fantagraphics Books I have every comic book Jordan Crane ever did and I probably have already seen all the material in this compilation but WOW! When I got a hold of this book and flipped through it, the beauty of the design, from the texture of the paper to the the printing and the spine, knocked me out. It is just an incredibly beautiful book that showcases the advance in printing technics. Granted, it’s not cheap! It’s a must for anybody interested in that type of art book/graphic novel hybrid that rises above all the others. Thank you Fantagraphics for taking risks and producing such gems. Tongues Vol. 1, Anders Nilsen, Pantheon Books Over the years I did buy from Nilsen at TCAF a few of the individual chapters but when this volume came out, I was curious to see if it was going to include the cut out pages and all the little extras that cost a fortune to print and is usually reserved for shorter hand assembled print runs. Well, Pantheon did an amazingly fateful job on this one. L’infiniment moyen et plus si infinités dans les limites finies d’une édition minimaliste, Marc-Antoine Mathieu, Delcourt I don’t think any of his boundary pushing work has been translated in English, am I wrong? All of his books are narrative experiments, and Mathieu manages each time to produce a theatrical experience within the pages of his graphic novels. So far, he’s included cut out panels, a pop-up, conceptual stories where for example, you begin that story in the middle, a story that takes place within seconds. This artist challenges himself at every opportunity. His latest is very cheeky. Using a magnifying glass, he drew as small as he could an 82 pages story fitting in a one inch book that is packaged with a magnifying glass. Mathieu has managed to draw something even smaller than the smallest Chris Ware text! The packaging is beautiful, it’s an art object/graphic novel/high concept album. It’s also funny in a Kafka way, as the title is probably the longest ever for the tiniest graphic novel ever drawn and printed. Muséum, Eric Lambé, FRMK FRMK are know for difficult books and as ambitious as FRMK are, their books are not for the average reader of comics. They produce gorgeous books for adults interested in the combination of literature and art. Eric Lambé has had great success lately with Antipodes (Casterman), an album written by David B. that came out in 2024. In this solo outing, Lambé’s book is about what you experience and take away from a museum, images bound in sensations and feelings. Lambé manages to create a playful narrative, sometimes abstract, sometimes surreal with very little dialogue. The work of a master. Lézards rêves, Jean Giraud Moebius, Moebius production Moebius production’s new book explores and showcases excerpts from the artist sketchbooks. It’s like discovering a caché of gems that Giraud/Moebius left behind after passing away. This book is filled with gorgeous improvised illustrations and short stories that reminds us of his mastery in fishing out striking images from his subconscious mind. The book itself is small, a beauty to hold and behold. The Moon and the Serpent Bumper Book of Magic, Alan Moore and Steve Moore, Top Shelf This reminds me of The Museum of Lost Wonder by Jeff Hoke, published by Weiser in 2006. It tackled the same subject, magic and the occult sciences, in the same way, both sharing an illuminating vision of the world of magic, explaining and putting these things in perspective. They are fun books: playful, erudite but accessible. In the case of The Moon and the Serpent, probably the last ever comics from Alan Moore. Just for that reason (but there are many more), seek it out. And a few more, in a more classical format. Bowling with Corpses, Mike Mignola, Dark Horse When I heard Mignola was doing original stories after Hellboy, I bought this book but I put it away because, somehow, I expected to be disappointed. How could he top his work with Hellboy? Well I can report that it was quite the opposite. Unshackled by the heavy mythology created for the Hellboy universe, these new stories are a breath of fresh air. Funny, whimsical and amazing page layouts, this book shows that Mignola is a master storyteller/artist and I look forward with glee to what he will uncover in this new universe that he’s created. Soozy No 1 and no 1 1/2, Seosie, self-published Okay, here’s at least one independent book from TCAF that I got it this year. New pages from Seosie were also published in Charlotte mensuel in France. It’s really difficult to illustrate sexual situations and make it cute and and funny. A lot of people still associate pleasure with violence and punishment. Not so here with Seosie. She is such a talented artist, able to paint realistic canvas and then switch to cartoony figures for these books, while her drawings are still exquisite and expressive. The French in France have already discovered her! Your turn now… Absolute Martian Manhunter, Camp and Rodriguez, DC I am not that into multiverses and superhero comic books — corporate products spiked with new sauces every few years! A good friend gave me Absolute Martian Manhunter by Camp and Rodriguez knowing I would like that one … and I did. The LSD-tinged visuals within create a really interesting narrative mixing nearly abstracts visuals and symbols within a more classic comics grid, but with a modernistic twist. A really interesting experiment by both authors within the trappings of the genre. Wishing they’ll attempt something like that someday, but in a more adult vein with their own characters.\ Tales of Paranoia, Robert Crumb, Fantagraphics books I have missed Crumb, it’s been decades since I bought one of his 32-page comic book. Here, he reminds us that he is still a master at this! His stories are rich, compact, deep and layered. More please Robert! And here we enter the French zone ... L’association strikes back! This year, as l’Association still struggles with the financial comic book bubble that is bursting in France, three founders of l’Association came out with excellent graphic novels and story collection, reminding us that they are still at the top of their creative game. Monsieur Chouette, David B., L’Association After many years, a return to a longer black and white narrative that follows two main characters as they go into hell as imagined by David B. David’s stark black and white images result in some of the most interesting and gorgeous composition within a page that I have seen in 2025. No one is more adept at balancing black and white masses and turning them into light and darkness. A work by a master storyteller. La fin du monde, Stanislas, L’Association This is a collection of short stories in a ligne claire style. It's a melt-in-your-mouth goodness though the eyes experience! A complete delight. MENU, 30/40, Jean-Christophe Menu, L’Apocalypse Comic legend and designer Etienne Robial relaunched the 30/40 collection that he used to publish at Futuropolis with an issue written and drawn by Jean-Christophe Menu. Again, Menu shows off his complete mastery of the form and proposes multiple stories, longer works on the passing of his father and mother are moving and touching, elegys from the heart. Menu also revisits past series and characters and shows that he is still one of the mort important contemporary French comic creator. Québec highlights. Distributed mostly in Quebec book shops (with a few copies shipped out to France and Belgium), most of the States and English Canada have no idea that such a vibrant community publishes really distinctive and original works in French within Canada. Once in a while Drawn and Quarterly, Conundrum Press and POW POW will translate some, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. ROTOTO, Richard Écrapou, Monsieur ED Richard Écrapou (best know as Richard Suicide), winner in 2015 of the best Québec graphic novel, has been illustrating books for kids for quite some time with great success. This is the first time Richard, who is know in Quebec comics for his writing stye for adults, tackles his first kids story by himself. What you wind up is kinda of an artists book for kids, in the vein of Françoise Mouly’s Toon Books but with a sharper and edgier vision. Libres d’Obéir, Casterman et Le Prince des Oiseaux de Haut Vol, La Pastèque, Philippe Girard Philippe Girard, who burst on the international scene with the Leonard Cohen biography, On A Wire (Drawn and Quarterly), had a stellar year in 2025. His book chronicling Antoine de St-Exupéry’s stay in Québec during world war two, and months prior to writing The Little Prince, explores where he was in his life and suggests what might have led him to writing the second most popular book of all time. This graphic novel by Philippe and the following that came out a few months after, Libre d’Obéir showcases his innovative layouts which often plays with graphics and symbols. adapted from Johann Chapoutot’s essay, it is essential to understanding our current events as it explores how the Nazi work ethics was co-opted by big corporations, from Germany to the United States. Really good adult subject matter rendered by an author reaching a peak in his career. Interludes de Courtoisie, Noémie Poulin, Moelle Graphik Three stories, weaved both symbolically and figuratively into a wordless narrative. Not quite abstract, this book somehow casts a spell: an hypnotic flow of images takes over you when you start reading. Mysterious and hard to define, an expending worldview told though images. Magical in the purest way possible, like real life can sometimes be. Filles du Roy (origines), Louis Rémillard and Dom Leblond, Septentrion Louis Rémillard is one of the first self-publishing Quebec artists who became active in the '70s. In the last few years, as he passages seventy years of age, he managed to hit his stride with richly detailed and historically accurate stories about the First Nations in Quebec and Canada. His latest, working with scriptwriter Dom Leblond, is a long term chronicle about the King’s daughters (les filles du Roy), mostly women living in poverty in France who in 1663, who were enticed to sail to the new world and settle in New France (Québec), marry and populate the French colonies. With his eye for fascinating details, Rémillard illustrates a engaging story about the trip these women undertook to get to North America. A rich, entertaining and fascinating read. Pierre Fournier: Le Capitaine Québec, Jean-Dominic Leduc, La Pastèque, Okay, at least one French book on Québec comics history. It might even be sold out by the time this list appears. Still, Jean-Dominic Leduc does an incredible job of retelling Pierre Fournier’s journey as he attempts, through the creation of comic book characters like Capitaine Kébec, to create a viable space for Quebec comics creator to thrive in the seventies and eighties. Much more than a biography, thought Fournier’s eyes, we witness how the pioneering efforts by Fournier and other like Jacques Hurtubise, played out and created the basis for what would become the modern Quebec comic book/bande dessinée Montreal scene. A fast paced fantastic read with a rich visual iconography. Spread Love Comix No. 30, edited by Uncle Gil, Spread Love Smaller than a regular comix, Spread Love has been coming out monthly for a few years now. A love letter to those underground seventies anthologies, it features a lot of new young underground comix voices like Robin Bougie and Dexter Cockburn. It usually has an interesting short interview conducted by Uncle Gil (with the likes of Dennis Kitchen and Dave Cooper) and a selection of comics that are trashy, a bit shocking to some, but in the end, it all amounts to good clean (and dirty) fun. This one is published in English.

Features The Editors | December 23, 2025 We both know the history of superlatives creates a flattened, reductive interpretation of our world. But they're also the quickest way to label a praise for those recommendations we give in order to connect with one another, and isn't that why we're here? To find something in common, to stave off the loneliness for another hour? Should you have any additions, questions, or qualms: treat yourself by commenting below. We'll be seeing you in 2026. — The Editors (Click on a name to jump to their selections) Jean Marc Ah-Sen Robert Aman Tiffany Babb Jason Bergman Colin Blanchette Kevin Brown Clark Burscough RJ Casey Henry Chamberlain Helen Chazan Michael Dooley Alex Dueben Malcy Duff Austin English Jim Falcone Andrew Farago Shaenon K. Garrity Nicole Georges Corinne Halbert Charles Hatfield Tim Hayes Bart Hulley Christopher Irving John Kelly Hank Kennedy Christina Lee Chris Mautner Sean McCarthy Tate McFadden Daniel Meyerowitz Claire Napier Brian Nicholson Isaac Odai Hagai Palevsky Leonard Pierce Richard Pound Zach Rabiroff Oliver Ristau Cynthia Rose Tom Shapira J. Webster Sharp Valerio Stivè Marc Tessier *** (articles) (top) My favorite comic releases and reissues of the year, in no particular order: *** (articles) (top) Although I firmly believe that the best comics are being produced right now — works that will only be surpassed by those yet to come— I can’t help feeling, when asked to sum up the year, that noticeably fewer comics have seen the light of day compared with last year. This impression is entirely subjective; I have no empirical data to support it. Still, it may not be wholly unreasonable given the dark clouds gathering over the comics landscape: rising tariffs, increasing production costs, Diamond’s bankruptcy, to name just a few possible factors. And if that weren’t enough, several publishers have reported serious financial losses, among them France’s L’Association, which has publicly appealed to its readers for support in order to survive. That said, the year has also delivered a number of truly outstanding works, which I have done my best to rank in the list below. An undisputed number one is Swiss cartoonist Nando von Arb’s Bouquet de peurs. This brick of an autobiographical work, dealing with von Arb’s mental illness, manages to fuse influences from Frida Kahlo, Brecht Evens, and illustrations reminiscent of Czech children’s books from the 1970s in a wholly unique way. Although mental illness is far from a new subject in comics, Bouquet de peurs is the most compelling work on the topic since David B.’s portrayal of his brother’s epilepsy from the 1990s. Anders Nilsen’s Tongues may contain one plot element too many, but few cartoonists can juggle Greek mythology, a talking chicken, soldiers, an American hitchhiker, and more with the same finesse as Nilsen. The result is a stunning reading experience, driven by powerful and often haunting imagery. Moa Romanova’s second book in English, Buff Soul, can be read as a graphic travel diary, drawing on a long tradition of documenting life on tour. Romanova follows her friend ShitKid to a music festival in Texas, and while the book includes genre-typical elements — such as the rebellious and often self-destructive tendencies of the rock music scene — its greatest strength lies in its sensitive portrayal of genuine friendship. When Jean-Christophe Menu, together with Étienne Robial, decided to revive the legendary 30/40 series, Menu was the first to contribute a volume of his own. Expectations were high, and he had no trouble living up to them. The comics dealing with his parents’ deaths rank among the finest work he has ever produced — and, by extension, among the strongest examples of autobiographical comics as a genre. World Within the World, Julie Gfrörer’s collection of short stories revisits her familiar uncanny version of our world, one filled with desire, despair, and the universal need for connection. For all their macabre qualities, the dark corners Gfrörer explores are also very funny. In sixth place, I’ve put Ville Ranta, who seems incapable of making a bad book. For over twenty years, Ranta has chronicled his life in comics. His latest work revisits the period when he was active at a Finnish cultural magazine, where he, among other things, published a comic that satirically commented on the Finnish political leadership’s response to the Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark—a topic he discussed in an interview with The Comics Journal. In Les buveurs de vin, the reader follows both the events themselves and their aftermath, interspersed with prodigious amounts of drinking. That Ranta remains untranslated into English becomes more baffling with every new book. New York Review Comics deserves special praise for finally translating into English another book by Yvan Alagbé, co-founder of Amok and one of the most influential publishers of the French alternative comics scene of the 1990s. The book continues Alagbé’s sustained exploration of race and colonialism in contemporary France. A younger — but equally prodigious — storyteller is Cameron Arthur, whose fanzine Swag has been a joy to follow. Stories from its early issues have now been collected into a single volume. With cartoonists like Arthur, the future of comics looks bright. *** (articles) (top) *** (articles) (top) The vast majority of my comics reading in 2025 was research for interviews on this site. Of those, I have to mention Anders Nilsen's Tongues, and the truly surprising return of Jeff Nicholson's Colonia as particularly noteworthy new books. Otherwise most of the new comics I read this year were ... fine, I guess? Not a whole lot came to mind when I sat down to look back on the year. We did get a new Love & Rockets collection from Jaime Hernandez (Life Drawing), which was excellent as always, and I also very much enjoyed Santos Sisters vol. 1 by Greg & Fake. But a lot of other books were just forgettable, if not downright disappointing. With one surprising exception, The Solitary Gourmet. There's a local Japanese restaurant my family eats at regularly, and they always play the television series based on this manga on their screens. Without subtitles, of course, forcing us to try to guess what's going on. I had dubbed the series "Inspector Food" because it looked like a show about a detective, only one where all he does is eat. I wasn't too far off, I suppose — he's not a cop, just a salesman. But anyway, the manga by Jirō Taniguchi and Masayuki Kusumi is wonderful. As noted by Joe McCulloch in his review, the book is best enjoyed in small bites, something I appreciate. It's small, it's quiet, there's no major drama to be found, it's beautifully illustrated, and it's all about food. Maybe I'm having flashbacks to all the time I spent wandering Tokyo by myself, or maybe it says something about my state of mind, but this weird book about a man eating food by himself is my favorite graphic novel of 2025. *** (articles) (top) 1) Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles Zine Publications) I passed up the opportunity to buy this book a few times before I pulled the trigger, and even then, I only bought it because of the high quality of Bubble’s other publications (Stories from Zoo by Anand was a revelation), not because the book looked that interesting at first glance. I was wrong. It’s a fantastic book of short stories, and it’s the book that I’ve thought about the most since I first read it. I hope that we see a lot more work from Cameron Arthur. 2) Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) I was shocked when I heard that Crumb had a new comic book coming, hot on the heels of Dan Nadel’s wonderful biography. It was a pleasant shock, even though I was prepared for it to be forgettable work by a once great artist. Luckily for me (and everyone else, except his haters), he’s still a great artist, and he can still draw like a motherfucker. Even though he’s wrong about almost everything, Crumb communicates his beliefs clearly and effectively. This comic is by far the best value of the year as well. It’s a dense, satisfying read, and it’s re-readable as well. It delivers more than most graphic novels with ten times the page count. 3) Tongues Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) If you’ve been reading Tongues in its serialized form, then you’re probably aware that it’s a very good comic, but reading the existing story in one go is a different matter entirely. There’s still another big book coming to finish this story off, but I think it’s safe to say at this point that it’s Nilsen’s best book so far. Considering the fact that his previous work has ranged from good to excellent, that’s no mean feat. This book is the summation of his work as a cartoonist, and it’s thrilling to witness a great cartoonist at the peak of his powers dive headlong into his own preoccupations in such a considered and mature way. 4) Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) I knew nothing about this book or its creator before I read it. I flipped through it and looked good. When you take the time to actually look at it, though, you realize just how good it looks. The sheer craft on display is mesmerizing. Torices utilizes every kind of form and mode that he can think of to tell the story of a hapless loser meandering through his pathetic life who fails to aid one of the few people that’s ever been kind to him. The story is simple and it’s not as funny as it thinks it is, but I’ll admit I was impressed by the audacity of the storytelling, and the book overall. 5) King-Cat Comics and Stories #84 by John Porcellino (self-published) At this point, King-Cat is like the tides. It’s a natural force that seems inevitable, and you know the form will be familiar. The content is never the same, even if the preoccupations are. Love, death, music, groundhog sightings … they’re all here, as usual. At this point, Porcellino is an institution, of a kind; and like a lot of institutions, he’s taken for granted. He shouldn’t be. I’m grateful for each new issue of King-Cat and I hope he makes them for years to come. 6) The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Measured against Joe Sacco’s other books, this is a fairly minor work. Of course, a minor work by Sacco is better than most cartoonists could ever hope for. India is vast, both in terms of its geography and its history, and this relatively thin book only scraped the surface of the corruption, sectarianism, and bloodletting that has plagued the country’s modern history. The book is beautifully drawn and Sacco packs a lot into these pages, but for the first time when reading one of his books I felt like maybe he had bitten off more than he could chew. As always, I’m glad he took the bite, especially since no one else seems likely to follow in his footsteps and make harrowing books like he has, over and over again. 7) Love Languages by James Albon (Top Shelf Productions) Each of Albon’s books is different from the last. I’ve liked all of them. This book walked a tightrope, though instead of falling into the abyss, the danger was that it would fall into cloying sentimentality. That’s not a fate worse than death, mind you, but when the story is a romance that risk is high to begin with. The romance in this story is well-earned, even if it isn’t revelatory. Albon’s storytelling is, however. I’ve never seen a comic handle multiple spoken languages as skillfully as he does here, blending English, French, and Mandarin together, artfully. It’s a beautiful comic by an underrated cartoonist. 8) The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) I don’t know what I expected this book to be, but it was different than whatever I expected. I knew that the drawing would be great, and it is. There are times when you come across a page that’s so unbelievably gorgeous it just stops you in your tracks. Tyler’s exploration of her grief, and grief in general, gets exhausting after a while, but I think that’s the point. Over the course of 200+ dense, lushly illustrated pages she digs into one of the hardest experiences life has to offer, and from that pain she creates beauty. It’s a book that will sit with you. 9) Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) Richard Sala has been one of my favorite cartoonists for a very, very long time. This book, originally printed in a magazine format forty years ago, has eluded me, so imagine my surprise, and pleasure, when I heard that it was being printed in a luxurious hardcover edition. This early work is a lot of fun. All of Sala’s work was fun, though the way it was fun varied greatly over the years. For anyone who fondly remembers his Invisible Hands segments from MTV’s Liquid Television, I would imagine they would enjoy this work. For me, it was the missing piece of a puzzle I’ve been putting together for a few decades and, happily, a wonderful comic from beloved cartoonist. 10) Ginseng Roots: A Memoir by Craig Thompson (Pantheon) What this book is, is impressive. Making a book this long is impressive (440+ pages) but it’s not uncommon nowadays. What is uncommon is how much cartooning went into every single page. Thompson lavishes those pages with a lot of ink, and a lot of stories, too. It’s subtitled “A Memoir” and it is one, but it also delves into the history of his family, his community, ginseng farming (in China and North America), and where they all are at today. The ambition of this book impressed me, and it delivered on that ambition. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman Vol. 1: The Zoo by Scott Snyder, Nick Dragotta, and Frank Martin DC’s Absolute series reimagines well-known heroes without their well-known back stories. This Bruce Wayne grows up lower- to middle-class, so he lacks the financial resources of the traditional story, leaving him to rely even more on his mental abilities. Gotham is the same place, though, overrun by crime bosses and a group called the Party Animals who seek to sow chaos. The strongest part of this work is that the focus remains solely on Batman’s desire to do good in the world, to seek justice for everybody, which has always been at his core. You Must Take Part in Revolution by Badiucao and Melissa Chan Badiucao and Chan don’t provide a neat ending to their work, as there aren’t easy answers for how and when one should act against a tyrannical government. However, they’re clear that inaction isn’t a viable option. Spent by Alison Bechdel It seems obvious to mention Alison Bechdel when talking about great work from the year, but she’s taken a bit of a risk here by returning to fiction after her past three memoirs. While she certainly focuses on friends and community, as she did in Dykes to Watch Out For, her exploration of how we spend our time or money or energy seems particularly relevant today. She even ends with a brief glimmer of hope in community, something we could certainly use right now. Muybridge by Guy Delisle Delisle goes well beyond Muybridge’s famous photograph of a horse to create the world of invention that he was a part of. Most interestingly, Delisle shows Muybridge’s influence on animation, motion pictures, and graphic works like Delisle’s, an influence that continues well beyond what Muybridge could imagine. Absolute Wonder Woman, vol. 1: The Last Amazon by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Mattia de Iulis, and Dustin Nguyen Here, Diana doesn’t grow up on Themyscira. Instead, she’s raised in the underworld. Rather than preventing her from caring about and fighting for humanity, that banishment simply gave her more weapons to fight for justice. Nightwing: On with the Show by Dan Watters, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Wes Abbott Dan Watters and team take on the challenge of picking up Nightwing’s story after the amazing run led by Tom Taylor. They draw on Nightwing’s past experiences with the circus and his early days with Batman, while throwing him in the middle of a gang war that has begun after Blockbuster’s death in the earlier series. *** (articles) (top) Well, I don’t know about you, but 2025 sure had a lot of “Lemon, it’s Wednesday” vibes to it for me, so, much like last year, a list compiled in a bedraggled state, running to the lecture hall with a slice of toast in my mouth, but a list nonetheless, from your friendly neighbourhood linkblogger. While the lion’s share of the pop culture outlet coverage seemed to go to the title with the steroidally embiggened versions of Gotham’s denizens, for this regular-sized reader the most interesting of DC Comics’ Absolute line have absolutely been Absolute Wonder Woman by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, et al. and Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodriguez, et al., the first volumes for both of which mess with their respective mythoi in interestingly spiky ways, and don’t mind assuming that the reader will be able to keep pace and catch up when dropped in media res, and both of which also have some of the most pleasingly arresting visuals I’ve seen in a superhero comic for a while. Now, as long as they don’t tank the ongoing supracontinuity fun with plodding crossover events that kill an entire line’s momentum, we’ll be laughing. Taking the coveted top spot for comic that made me say “oh, mate, brutal” out loud the most times while reading it this year, we have The Sickness, Volume 1 by Lonnie Nadler, Jenna Cha, et al., the timeline hopping nastiness of which put me in mind of the creeping descent into madness and unmooring from reality as depicted in Providence by Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows. The slow burn reveals and peeling back of the consistently unnerving story playing out in the first collected volume for the series has left me strongly anticipating that volume two will also be a future best-of contender. Cleansing the palate after the nastiness [complimentary] of the last pick, comes the warmhearted delights of Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank, which was yet another annual pick cribbed from Sally Madden and Katie Skelly’s aces Thick Lines podcast, and which was a much needed dose of a slice-of-life strip that’s just consistently Really Nice and Properly Funny. The closing narrative coda, returning to best friend protagonists Miss Ruki and Ecchan ten years down the line, is genuinely lovely. As a classic dyed-in-the-wool trade-waiter, I was very glad to see The Santos Sisters by Greg & Fake receive a winningly handsome collected edition (peep that see-thru acetate dust jacket and thick paper stock) this year, which serves well the nod and a wink punchlines to dirty jokes with clean lines to be found within. This book sings as this year’s shining example that, sometimes, like Dandadan in last year's list, all you really need, to pep you up during a grim period in history, is a comic that’s horny and weird and fun and good to look at in equal measure. *** (articles) (top) Alive Outside, ed. by Cullen Beckhorn and Marc Bell (Neoglyphic Media).

Thank you to all the artists listed below. (If I have written about any of these books in my “Arrivals and Departures” column this year, I will include a link.) Honorable Mentions (in no order): Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy Tedward by Josh Pettinger Prop Comic by Veronica Graham Animal Denial by Emilie Gleason K is in Trouble Again by Gary Clement Them Shaped Clouds by Max Huffman The Shifting Ground Vol. 1 by Joe Walsh Laser Eye Surgery by Walker Tate The Past is a Grotesque Animal by Tommi Parrish Slick Susan and the Mysterious Soup by Rebecca Kirby The Weight by Melissa Mendes “Kristof” by Alex Schubert Igor the Assistant by Haus of Decline Top 10 of 2025 (in order!): 10.)

Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang 4.) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. 3.) Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers 2.) Dogtangle by Max Huffman 1.) River Rangers #8 by Henry McCausland *** (articles) (top) We began 2025 with a big event title, the first volume of Tongues, by Anders Nilsen, and we end the year with another career milestone, Ephemerata by Carol Tyler. Both books are equally captivating in their own ways and speak to the care and dedication of their respective creators. Both books are multi-layered, push the limits of the medium and maintain the traditional structures in beautiful ways. Other titles in 2025 doing the same at an exemplary level are Insectopolis by Peter Kuper, the collected Gingseng Roots by Craig Thompson, The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco, Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy, Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith and The New York Trilogy, featuring Paul Karasik as editor and contributor. There’s always more to add to a list and it depends upon the focus, among other things. Perhaps it can be dependent upon a cool factor—but we can’t all be cool kids, right? A list of what gets excluded is as intriguing as what gets included. Anyway, I suppose you can honestly get tripped up in terms of what best represents any given year. One thing to keep in mind is that any art form, particularly comics, is years in the making and various versions of it might come out at various years until you get the definitive version. You also have the heavy hitters, the giants in the industry, right alongside newcomers. If you think it’s easy for me and my friend and colleague Paul Buhle to sift through the onslaught on titles each year and review them at Comics Grinder, then you’ve got a screw loose. At the end of the day, it’s those big-name comics artists, out there leading the way, who are hopefully keeping us all honest. They’re there to set an example and are supposed to tell us we’re all in this together. With that in mind, I add to this list, in no particular order, notable cartoonists making notable work: Introverts Illustrated by Scott Finch, available thru Partners & Sons. This Slavery by Scarlett & Sophie Rickard, published by SelfMadeHero The Poet Volumes 1 & 2 by Todd Webb (self-published). Molly and the Bear by Bob and Vicki Scott, published by Simon & Schuster. Wally Mammoth: The Sled Race by Corey R. Tabor & Dalton Webb, published by HarperCollins. Tedward by Josh Pettinger, published by Fantagraphics.

The King’s Warrior by Huahua Zhu, published by Bulgilhan Press. *** (articles)(top) I hate writing best-of lists. Even with the caveat of “favorite” over “best,” I feel these lists are often a testament to what I have not read and what I have overlooked far more than what I love. Nonetheless, I persist with these damn things, because telling people what comics I love is something I was put on this earth to do. Perhaps this is weakness, but nothing has made me gladder as a critic than the kind words from readers and artists alike that I've gotten over the years. I'll go on. (lol) 2025 was a bad year for human rights but arguably a good year for comics. A great argument in favor of it being a good year for comics is that I published a few. An even better argument is that we got the collected Dogtangle this year. My favorite comics are formally ambitious, ranging from literary work to literal pornography, all tied together by a persistent excitement for the medium they live in. I've listed out a few: Dogtangle by Max Huffman, Fantagraphics 2025 is the year of Dogtangle. Social satire that collapses in on itself. Cartoon humor that verges on formlessness. A love story, perhaps. A very big dog. I should have more words about Dogtangle, but how can I sum up this mass of mutts? It speaks for itself, or, perhaps, barks. A Garden of Spheres Vol. 1 by Linnea Sterte, Peow2 A vast, beautiful, curious book that demands revisitation. Wide open vistas for the eyes to drink. What Happened After My Place Got So Humid It Grew Magic Mushrooms and I Ate Them and Got Super Horny by Karasu Chan, J18 I am dead serious, one of my favorite comics this year was this ero-manga with that title. Visually inventive and deeply funny pornography about a woman's delusional quest to make a real friend, bolstered by energetic mark-making and impeccable comedic timing. Likely the comic I have recommended to people in conversation the most this year, tied with the majesterial Dogtangle (usually brought up in different company, mind you ... Usually.). Unsinkable Ship of Fools by Jonas Goonface, Iron Circus Remaining on the subject of pornography (and we must!), nobody draws people fucking right now quite like Jonas Goonface. Ship of Fools is a brilliant work of folklore-by-way-of-sex-farce full of color and weight that should embarrass all other action cartoonists of any variety. Deep erotica that you will return to. Aneido's Anthology 1: The Soul-Selling Corporate Drone & Other Fanciful Tales by Aneido, Red String Translations Recency bias may be speaking here (I just read this one), but after trudging through a fair bit of yuri this year, green or otherwise, Aneido is the artist whose work has captivated me the most overall and this collection is my favorite yet. Their line is soft and pleasant, their stories hang dreamlike in a space between wish fulfillment and something more otherworldly. A reminder that queer comics and alternative comics share the same urge at their root, to do something better than the mainstream. Idella Dell and Valley Valley by Audra Stang, Self published There are a lot of comics I read on social media this year and some of them were even very good. Audra Stang is doing something else, the freshest comics-on-comics thing to come along in a long time. Stang loves her characters, and beats them over and over with deeply familiar grief and rage. Both of these women suck and I am rooting for them. Szarlotka by Jas Hice, Frog Farm A small, fucked up story, one of the most beautiful two-tone riso print jobs I've seen in a long time, a novella of a zine that cements Hice as an artist to watch. I can't get enough of the Hichcockian vice of voyeur and victim in this one. Troubling! SF “Shorts Folio” Serialized Fragments of Supplementary Files #1 by Ryan Cecil Smith, self-published Speaking of amazing riso printing, this comic is probably my favorite book as an aesthetic object this year. These colors, wow! It's been a while since Smith's cast of adventurers last graced spinner racks, and they are truly a sight for sore eyes. You simply have to love a comic about a mailman in space. Round World Thinking by Ana Woulfe, Reptile House Another beautiful riso artifact, that stands beside Dogtangle as a gag comic that is a universe unto itself, a liberatory trans-femme project in the Gendertrash tradition that gets into the weeds with plants and isn't afriad to let out a cackle. More comics like this forever! In brief, I will also mention a few of my favorite reprints and localizations of “classics” from this year: More ink will be spilled on these by yours truly in due time. To take a brief dip in the conflict of interest reservoir, most of my favorite zines this year were by the Hamilton-based cartoonist Zoot, who I have published in my anthology comic Afternoon Affair and who tabled next to my press at Expozine in Montreal. Bias disclosed, nobody is doing it like them. Highlights this year included the informative How To Get Bit By A Werewolf, the furry dyke drama Butch Bait (published by the gods at Diskette Press), and the truly miraculous BL boner pill crack ship The Hardest Day Of My Life. Read those if you get a chance, and you'll understand why I couldn't not mention them. And on that questionable note, I bid you adieu. Hopefully 2026 is a better year for everyone, and a lot of comics are good as well. *** (articles) (top) It's my second annual “Not-E*sn*r Awards by a Former Will Eisner Awards Judge (2020)," where I'll again bypass the nomination process and declare category winners based on my own "Best of the Year" opinions. Any relation between other, official Awards and mine is purely comical.1 Ice Cream Man #43: One-Page Horror Stories by W. Maxwell Prince, Martin Morazzo, Zoe Thorogood, Grant Morrison, Matt Fraction, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Geoff Johns, Matt Fraction, Patton Oswalt, Jeff Lemire, etc. (Image) ~ Best Single Issue/One-Shot You needn’t be familiar with Ice Cream Man and co-creators Prince and Morazzo’s bold, ongoing structural experiments with the medium to enjoy the rich variety of flavors offered, here served in tasty, single-page scoops. Prince adroitly authors multiple stories and writers like Johns, Morrison, DeConnick, and Fraction bring their own unique, terrifying sensibilities, each rendered in styles to enhance the stories, wonderfully told through a variety of narratives and formats. Among the most imaginative are a Candy Land-ish board game, a Gustav Doré-styled descent into Hell, and, most frighteningly: a New York Times front page. Creepy. And yummy. Monkey Meat: The Summer Batch by Juni Ba (Image) ~ Best Limited Series With stylized art reminiscent of Michael T. Gilbert, Monkey Meat immerses you in its hilarious, energetic asphalt-and-jungle world. Inside the Monkey Meat Company, feces are flung at capitalism, gods, tourism, the military, colonization, and even piloted robots. To emphasize his themes, Ba makes full use of his medium with such devices as selective coloring and frequent, intense, in-your-hairy-face splash pages. These absurd, endearing, despicable anthropomorphs have you hoping for further installments. The Seasons, Volume 1 by Rick Remender and Paul Azaceta — Best New Series and Paul Azaceta, The Seasons #1-4 (Image) ~ Best Cover Artist Seasons is a delightfully sinister adventure/horror/mystery, rendered in joyous, vibrant hues. Remender introduces us to the enchanting Season sisters, each bursting with their distinct personalities: Autumn, serious archaeologist; Summer, globe-trotting, temperamental superstar; Winter, passionate artist and mentor to the effervescent Spring, who kicks off a carnival adventure in a thrilling chase of… an envelope? Artist/co-creator Azaceta treats us to bold visuals on every page, and each of his four covers has its distinctive appeal, such as a threatening skull-clown faux-collage and a bold graphic recalling Esteban Maroto and Bob Peak’s Camelot. When you’re in the mood for fun, scary adventure, Azaceta’s creative virtuosity bids you to welcome any time of the year. Little Batman, Month One by Morgan Evans and Jon Mikel (Penguin/Random House) — Best Publication for Kids In Little Batman, writer Evans offers smart and well-delineated answers to nagging questions such as “Why does Batman need to pose as Bruce Wayne?” from the point of view of Bruce’s son, Damian. The young Wayne wants Little Batman’s exciting life all the time — “Homework is a crime!” — but he also learns the importance of being himself. Mikel’s art, a delightful mix of Sergio Aragones and Kyle Baker, keeps things lively, with pastiches of Batman: Year One and Golden Age Batman. And his splendidly fun silent sections — drawn by “Damian” and dabbed with outside-the-lines “crayon”, courtesy of colorist Ian Herring — should inspire even the youngest future Bat-artist. This little Batman story is most enjoyable for big people as well. Daisy Goes to the Moon by Mathew Klickstein and Rick Geary (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Publication for Teens The history behind Daisy is a trip in itself. Briefly, the real Daisy Ashford (1881-1972) began amusing her family with stories beginning at age four. Eventually, J.M. Barrie (of Peter Pan renown) printed them complete with the misspellings and rambling logic of genuine childhood innocence. Here, Geary departs from his established panel format while still displaying his unmistakably endearing storytelling mastery to perfectly tell Daisy’s rocketing adventures. Young readers will delight in her lovable self-admiration, bravery, cleverness, and playful wordplay, as well as her lighthearted, endearing companions. Adults will appreciate the antiquarian science, as well as giggle at Daisy’s spirit and cheekiness. Read it together with the kids. You’ll love it to the moon and back. Emma & Capucine, Volume 1 by Jérôme Hamon and Lena Sayaphoum (TokyoPop) ~ Best International Publication for Teens In this elegant bande dessinée, the teenage Emma and her younger sister are aspiring prima ballerinas with their sights set on the prestigious Paris Opéra. Like a splendidly choreographed dance performance, Lena Sayaphoum’s art is rendered with grace, eloquence, and spirit. His soft, fluid illustration style and muted color palette hit all the right notes to intone this tender tale of discovery, growth, and familial relationships. The Art of Milt Gross Vol. 1: The Judge Magazine Comics 1923–1924 by Paul C. Tumey (independently published) ~ Best Humor Publication Humor knows no decade. Or century, for that matter. The screwball cartoons of cartoon virtuoso Gross show that the best humor is still fresh and hilarious after 100 years. This, the first in a series, presents hundreds of rare, revolutionary cartoons from Judge during the early 1920s, which formed the foundation for Nize Baby, Count Screwloose, He Done Her Wrong, and numerous other successes (for the definitive compendium, see Tumey’s Gross Exaggerations: The Meshuga Comic Strips of Milt Gross, 1926-1934, from Sunday Press). Everyone will identify with the schadenfreudenly-funny frustrations of Gross’s everyman characters who deal with life’s simplest incidents that hilariously snowball from bad to worse to worser to worsest. Plus, the enlightening commentary by historian Tumey adds insight and depth, noting how Gross often reworked his gags, basically stealing from and improving upon himself. With the master of cartoon pantomime, words can’t fully express our enjoyment. And that’s no Banana Oil. Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best European Humor Publication Never mind the Marvel and DC Universes. The best way to enjoy – and challenge – yourself this year is to tumble into the anarchic, delightfully absurd Cornelius Universe. At nearly 400 pages, Spanish artist Torices gleefully explores the entirety of the comics medium through deliriously shifting eras and spaces, which he renders in a madcap array of styles and textures. Cornelius gleefully homages and vastly expands upon everything from Frank King’s Gasoline Alley to European bandes dessinée. And humor knows no boundaries: as proven here, it can be both merry and wretched, hilarious and unsettling. It’s also a celebration of the art of comics, skillfully pushing the very boundaries of the medium. Rich with multiple interpretations, Cornelius generously rewards repeated re-readings. Drawn to MoMA: Comics Inspired by Modern Art by Jon Allen, Gabrielle Bell, Barbara Brandon-Croft, Roz Chast, Liana Finck, Ben Passmore, Walter Scott, Chris Ware, others. (MoMA) — Best Anthology Beginning in 2019, the Museum of Modern Art commissioned an array of comics creators with diverse styles and sensibilities to create new strips, using visits to MoMA as their inspiration. And this book rewards us with fresh, thoughtful short stories offering a variety of approaches – literal and internal – and perspectives – sometimes playful, often poignant – from talents such as Roz Chast, Gabrielle Bell, Ben Passmore, and Liana Finck. Each, in their way, offer insights on the many diverse modes of art appreciation: aesthetic, social, personal, etc. Truly praiseworthy is the book’s ability to inspire and incentivize readers to experience and engage with gallery works as well, and bring back their own stories. Oh, and did I mention that the book also comes with a tall, spectacular Chris Ware fold-out poster, suitable for homes and galleries alike? The Novel Life of Jane Austen: A Graphic Biography by Janine Barchas & Isabel Greenberg (Black Dog & Leventhal/Greenfinch) ~ Best Reality-Based Work Whether or not you’re an Austenite, you’ll find this book as an elegant, captivating study. Barchas’s astute and affectionate devotion to Austen plays out on every page. And Greenberg’s delicate art and soft color palette affords the reader a captivating tour of 18th century London society and a fascinating glimpse into the Pride & Prejudice author’s life from young lady with nascent writing skills to struggling scribe to acclaimed novelist. Projections of Austen’s inspirations for her fictional scenes and character are well defined via her family’s heartbreaking economic and literary struggles. As she comes to realize that she’s “never alone”, we can all be rewarded by so positive a view of life. (Incidentally, Austen’s 250th birthday was just celebrated on Dec. 16) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Graphic Album–New Visually striking and contextually disturbing, this book is ultimately cathartic. Daringly designed with vignettes, ads, and games – Kayla E.’s remarkable tribute to the versatility of the medium – it bluntly explores the author/artist’s life as she endures abuse, emotional and physical, and mostly from her sadistic mother. Her simple, almost cutout-like art is unquestionably moving, capturing her heartbreak and growth. And its bright, vivid colors – especially the shocking red – are intensely penetrating in every unsettling scenario. There’s a creepy familiarity to the surroundings, which a check of the end notes reveals to be true: many pages are inspired by the more wholesome, sanitized 1950s comics like Archie and Little Dot. If you can handle the emotional excursion, you may find some precious hope amidst the rubbish. Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, David Mazzucchelli, Lorenzo Mattotti (Pantheon Graphic Library) — Best Adaptation from Another Medium City of Glass was revolutionary when it was first published back in 1995 – as an exceptionally well-done collaboration between Karasik and extraordinary artist Mazzucchelli – and the term “graphic novel” was relatively unknown. And on its own it’s justifiably considered a masterpiece, due in no small part to Karasik’s influence from Harvey Kurtzman, who he had as an SVA teacher, and Art Spiegelman, who he apprenticed for on Raw. And now we have all three of Auster’s brilliantly interwoven postmodern existential pulp detective stories in graphic novel form, with Mattotti’s art acting as center-story transition in illustrated novel and Karasik himself skillfully providing full-circle closure. These stories are essentially about writing – words – which Karasik and his two sterling collaborators have transformed into stories about words and images, so skillfully structured as to become most valuable as tutorials on communicating complex, intricate narratives – of loss, obsession, even meaninglessness – through creative, evocative visual storytelling. The Red Badge of Courage by Steven Crane, adapted by Steve Cuzor (Abrams) ~ Best International Adaptation from Another Medium Sorry, kids: Cuzor won’t help you write your book report. Instead, he’s given us one of the most powerfully illustrated adaptations of a book you may ever read or see, capturing Crane’s emotional shock of combat as if Civil War photographer Matthew Brady was reporting on that very battlefield. This is an excellent, primal condemnation of soldiers’ terror of dying, of cowardice, and of the damned depersonalization of men reduced to nothing more than fodder. Stark yet subtle chiaroscuro drives home the story’s violent misery, enhanced by Meephe Versaevel’s nuanced coloring, rendering days with muted browns and moonlit nights with soft blues. Crane makes this story real, terrifying, and profoundly human. Muybridge by Guy Delisle and Helge Dascher (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best U.S. Edition of International Material For 25 years, Canadian cartoonist Delisle has been producing first-person graphic travelogues through Asia and the Middle East. Muybridge is something completely different, a classic American story of a ambitious immigrant coming to America, embracing innovation, then fame, rising and eventually falling. It’s a huge-scale biography of one of the greatest influences on early filmmaking, art, and comics, while reading like a Dickens novel. Delisle follows a Canadian tradition of conveying more information, more detail, with far fewer lines, and he uses this to great effect in illustrating Eadweard Muybridge's film and motion experiments while revealing them as prototypical comics. In fact, it’s not just a brilliant biographical novel: it's also a visual treatise on sequential movement that belongs in the hands of any student of comics as well as cinema. Kylooe by Little Thunder (Dark Horse) ‚ Best U.S. Edition of International Material—Asia This trilogy of intimate, intensely emotion-driven stories, unified through a cute, white monster named Kylooe is a heartfelt gem. First is a psychedelic fantasy of an outcast high schooler, a Princess Camille seeking her Little Nemo. Next is a melancholy romance for anyone who’s ever broken up with someone they wish they hadn’t. And finally there’s a father/son tale about government-mandated emotions that hints of Harlan Ellison. This deeply moving, eminently shareable book is smartly rendered by Little Thunder, a pseudonymous Hong Kong author/illustrator, with deeply moving stories that’ll make you wish for a Kylooe in your own life. The Smythes by Rea Irvin, edited by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw (New York Review Books) — Best Archival Collection/Project — Comic Strips Irvin’s artistic legacy goes far beyond Eustace Tilley, his iconic monocled dandy and butterfly enthusiast who graced The New Yorker’s very first cover, with his Smythes among his more obscure works, most unfortunately, as it’s been an unheralded masterpiece. But this has been rectified by Johnson and Shaw with this gorgeous, deluxe, oversize highlighting from the strip, which originally ran Sundays in the Herald Tribune in – of course – New York in the 1930s, post-Market Crash. Every page is a chuckle and a half of clever and endearing banter between milquetoast John and Margie of the outrageous fashion sense. This collection reprints the best of five years of Irvin’s sweeping art and highlighting his eye for playful, innovative design as well as his graceful line. Of the millions of jokes about henpecked husbands and pretentious, social-climbing wives – hello, Maggie and Jiggs! – this is an undeniable classic. And among the back-page miscellany is Irvin’s witty 1943 Sunday funnies parody, Superwoman, which ran once before receiving a cease and desist notice from National, now DC Comics. Lore Remastered by Ashley Wood and T.P. Louise (Simon & Schuster/Image) — Best Archival Collection/Project—Comic Books Louise and Wood’s acclaimed, groundbreaking Lore is now reassembled for your reading pleasure. Part mesmerizing comic narrative, part text with intensifying illustrations, all serve as an engrossing and terrifying story of a woman searching for her father’s killer who discovers that mythic creatures, once banished from the world, are demanding to return. Newcomers to Wood’s art should find themselves enraptured by every image. This collection has added art pieces that astonish on their own. This is one for all lovers of fantasy. Jordan Crane, Goes Like This (Fantagraphics) — Best Writer/Artist You’ll find this in the twisted-mind section of your local bookstore. Within its trip-inducing cover is a daring compendium of narratives that span genres from warped Western to distorted Hitchcock to familiar, bitter relationships to oddly adroit wordplay and more. Crane’s wide variety of experimental, offbeat tales, splash pages, and interstitials evoke Frank King, Geoff Darrow, Seth, Warhol, William Morris, Shag, and, well, his own memorably sensation-inducing genius. Elsa Charretier, The City Beneath Her Feet (Dstlry) — Best Penciller/Inker and Jordie Bellaire, The City Beneath Her Feet — Best Coloring In this bloody action/thriller/romance, Charretier’s layouts explode and just keep exploding, right from the “La Femme Nikita”-style opening. Even in seemingly simple straight-on camera monologues, her slightest of strokes give us telling expressions with bits of business that reveal the character’s pain – tiny tears welling – or bitter joys in suffering smiles. The foregrounds and backgrounds meld into moods you can feel. This is nonstop breathtaking exhilarating, storytelling. And Jordie Bellaire’s in top form. Her colors are brilliant, as in both vivid and radiant. She breathes intensity into the drama and the action by choosing colors you don’t often see, in line holds and panels in specific tones that yell at you to pay attention! Throughout the whole book there’s never a dull page. Never. Jakub Rebelka, The Last Day of H.P. Lovecraft #1-2 (Boom Studios) — Best Painter/Multimedia Artist Red can be a raw, intensely disturbing color, and French artist Rebelka uses it to express the slow demise of horror master Lovecraft. Disconnected, bloodshot eyes are awash in crimson goo. A red-striped lighthouse morphs into a torrential scarlet sea. Blood courses down a hospital wall. A ruddy Cthulhu haunts the background. Lovecraft himself is perpetually presented – in the hospital, with his wife, with Houdini – in unsettling vermillion. Then there are the grays: the gloom that consistently surrounds Lovecraft’s psychological distress. In paint and ink, Rebelka unnerves us to our very heart on each and every page. After having read The Last Day … you may never view red the same way. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn and Quarterly) — Best Graphic Memoir and Mimi Pond, Do Admit — Best Lettering Best Memoir Awards aren't typically given to a true tale of six sisters in England, starting at the turn of the 20th century, but there you go. A study in contrasts, Pond has smoothly and skillfully woven her 1960s working-class San Diego childhood into the lives born to British aristocracy. Also, Best Lettering Awards aren't typically given to works that aren't Todd Klein variations, but every single letter of every word in Do Admit is exquisitely hand-lettered on every page, from cover to end. And I defy any other graphic novel this year to claim anywhere near the skill, imagination, and wit Pond's put into the variety of expressive texts and talking, serif, sans, script, blackletter. And she further enlivens her narrative with illustrations of newspaper and magazine covers, movie posters, maps, and hand-written... memoirs, all bursting from panels and pages, designed, sized, and styled with the greatest dexterity as well as spirit and verve. Best Graphic Novel of the Year? Yes, and not just admittedly but absolutely! ImageTexT, v. 15 #3, edited by Anastasia Ulanowicz — Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism ImageTexT’s most recent online journal has four exceptionally solid, smart, illustrated features with a diverse array of relevant political themes: an exploration of Chris Ware’s New Yorker covers about school shootings; a critical study of anthropomorphism in Soviet political cartoons during WWII; a tough examination of Australian cartoonists’ brutal attacks on Chinese men in the late 19th Century; and an in-depth analysis of the blurred lines between mainstream and underground in the 1970s, citing Denis Kitchen’s Arcade, Bill Griffith/Art Spiegelman’s Comix Book, and Steve Gerber’s Howard the Duck. And hey, it’s absolutely free for you to read right now. How Comics Are Made: A Visual History from the Drawing Board to the Printed Page by Glenn Fleishman (Andrews McMeel) — Best Comics-Related Book When reading a newspaper comic strip, how often have you wondered about the physical process of how they’re created? This question is hardly recognized, much less explored in-depth, in most comics histories. Well, throughout this informative, entertaining book Fleishman provides everything you need to know about the technical mechanics of the medium, which does a great deal enlighten us and enrich our enjoyment. His intelligent, humorous commentaries, with anecdotal asides, are simply a delight. All the information is presented in straightforward style, and expertly enhanced by hundreds of photos of massive machines and other tangible materials of mass reproduction of strips from classic – lookin’ at you, Yellow Kid – to contemporary to web. And as our Sunday funnies fade into the digital aether, why not spend a few post-paper weekends curled up with a comfortable copy of How Comics Are Made? Back to Black: Jules Feiffer’s Noir Trilogy by Fabrice Leroy (Rutgers University Press) — Best Academic Work The more the opportunity to introduce Feiffer to the world, the better the world becomes. And Leroy deserves the highest praise, not only for astutely situating this three-volume loving homage to noir within the broader context of his extraordinarily prolific and diverse art careers but also for his detective work on these detective stories, with insightful analysis of the ways in which Feiffer's loving homage to noir astutely uses American history from the Great Depression through the McCarthy era to incisively satirize and subvert our present culture. Also noteworthy is Leroy's appreciation of Feiffer's visuals: hiscreative reconfigurations of hard-boiled cinema devices into his subtle, sophisticated layouts and unique graceful, limber linework. Comic Book Apocalypse!: The Death of Pre-Code Comics and Why It Happened, 1940–1955 by David J. Hogan (Schiffer) — Best Scholarly Work This informative, engaging history takes an unblinking, insightful analysis of midcentury America's evolving culture, from the start of WWII to the institution of the CCA, which explores beyond the usual sex, crime, and horror comics suspects. Visually rich, with its clean page layouts and hundreds and hundreds of large, sharp color reproductions, this is the most attractive study of that censorious era to date. More scholarly books should be gifted with such luxurious design. Arthur Ferrier’s Pin-Up Parade! by Rian Hughes (Korero Press) — Best Publication Design America can count Russell Patterson, Dan DeCarlo, Bill Ward, and George Petty as its top echelon among classic cheesecake pin-up artists, and in the UK, Scotsman Arthur Ferrier is most highly – and rightfully – held in the highest esteem for his elegant, sophisticated renderings of the female figure during pin-up’s golden age. His prolific output ran from the 1930s to the ’60s, often in humor magazines such as Punch and Blighty over several decades. And now, Korero Press has released a magnificent, oversize, comprehensive, three-volume compendium with nearly 1,000 pages, including hundreds and hundreds of his brilliant illustrations, primarily single-panel gags but also comic strips and a variety of publication covers, adverts, and other ephemera. Ferrier's fluid linework – capturing his women's joyous spirit, expressive gestures, and even their evolving fashion styles - is simply a delight to behold. Plus, a couple dozen pages of each book are devoted to his own essays and correspondence course lessons on his craft. Most impressive for me is the superlative skill with which this dazzling, deluxe collection has been luxuriously packaged to a fare-thee-well with the highest production values by Britain’s master graphic designer/comics artist Rian Hughes. In 2020 Hughes merited two Eisner nominations, “Best Publication Design” and “Best Comics-Related Book” for his superb Logo-a-Gogo, also published by Korero. And here, he’s outdone himself. He’s combined Ferrier’s art with marvelous midcentury colors and typography onto the solid, sturdy cloth-textured slipcase box as well as each of the hardback covers. And then there’s the ribboned bookmarks, patterned endpapers, and luxurious cotton matte paper stock and crisp inks to enhance the vintage aesthetic. Pin-Up Parade! is easily the most spectacular publication of the year, bar none. It’s available in its entirety in England but at this time the first, Showgirl Sirens (1940-1949) – which includes an insightful intro into Ferrier’s career by Hughes – can be purchased in the U.S., with the other two, Burlesque Bombshells (1949-1954), and Cabaret Cuties (1954-1968), in the offing.

Hothead Paisan by Diane DiMassa Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan Mafalda: Book 1 by Quino, translated by Frank Wynne *** (articles) (top) As another year comes to an end, inside my home there are no seasons, and my bookshelves look like they contain the beautiful, ripened fruit of a perpetual stagnated tree. Returning though, I fear that the fruit will finally fall before being picked. Captain Carrot and the Amazing Zoo Crew still swing from the branches of these bushes, as if their powers of flight were just shenanigans on a bungee cord, awaiting the lost weekend in their company I crave. And too many other tomes are still, so very still, and silent, just their bright spines remaining joyful and noisy unfaded from elsewhere sunlight. As I look again in my bookshelf’s direction however, I am safe in the knowledge that some pages have been turned. I realise this year’s reading has been mostly focused on reading about cartoonists. They have inspired me in different ways: Recently I have been following the line of David Berman on lucky lyric sheets and his Portable February collection. And I have been returning to The Angriest Dog in the World, celebrating that special man. Sometimes we don’t get around to eating all the apples on my Dad’s apple tree, and they land on the ground and start to rot. And that’s ok. Still ... I’m glad comics never go rotten. *** (articles) (top) Below, I've picked 3 books that were all important to me for the same reason: when you have been involved with comics for a long time, as an artist or reader , there will be inevitable moments where you question if the medium is capable of all that you want from it, you begin to doubt your deep involvement in the artform---then, if you're lucky, at just the right moment, works like the ones listed below emerge and affirm all your most utopian hopes for the artform. If your faith is wavering in comics (and if you really love them, you must have this crisis from time to time), read any of these books: Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé I will be writing about this book at length in the upcoming print edition of The Comics Journal, here is small excerpt of what I wrote there: In a New York Times review of this book by Sam Thielman, a character named Michel's worse transgressions are listed, including that he "was in love with a woman who wasn’t his wife." Thielman read Misery of Love sensitively, but I found far more potent moments of Michel’s violence (both sexual and otherwise) in my readings of the book. Here we see how this work can be made anew upon each reading. Thielman stresses that he read the work multiple times (and recommends other readers do the same), but finds different fault lines than I did. Alagbé, in my reading, suggests that Michel has engaged in far worse transgressions, which Thielman ignores or does not see. In one sequence, his daughter Clare’s childhood self is confronted by cries from her mother "it was you who wanted him to be in love with you," "it was you who led him on," "little fool! how did you come up with all this?" One might expect an insinuation like this to occupy the climax of a narrative, but for Alagbé it is one note in the whole blink-and-you-will-miss-it focus and you’ll feel the tragedy, only for it to vanish by the next image — with the mist of it lingering back and forth across the book. One (to me, horrible) image shows Michel cradling Clare, during her childhood, in his arms. Alagbé uses the soft ink wash he employs throughout the book to a shocking effect here: the weight Michel applies to Clare is forceful, his face a distorted mess of wash, his hands cruel. This image communicates brutality, even in isolation. If we looked at it apart from the rest of the narrative, it would still provoke and we would draw conclusions from it, though more visceral than certain. Placed alongside 463 other images, all of them with their own unique weight, it pulsates. As we approach our fourth or fifth reading, the image lodges in our mind, infecting how we look at previous and subsequent sequences. The miracle of Misery of Love is that all 464 images carry the same force of reverberation. Alagbé presents us a "graphic novel" that defies the way in which we have grown comfortable reading graphic novels, which is as prose. This work is actually graphic, in that the images contain meaning independent of textual assistance. In a non-poetic work of art, there are times when information is presented artlessly: "he got in the car," "he ate dinner," etc. An elegant prosaic entertainer can make dead moments like these part of his rhythm, with meaning beyond what is necessary left aside. The plot, after all, must move forward at times. Misery of Love denies itself such license. One image gives us Alain (Clare's boyfriend, who is of African descent) in a car, next to Clare. Alagbé, without telling us, without prodding us, without begging for our understanding, depicts Alain’s at a remove from Clare. His stance, the tension of those seated in front of him, the contrast between Clare’s face and his, an ever so subtlety exaggerated ratio of proportions between Alain and his fellows — it’s as if Alagbé collages Alain into the picture, the expression he wears believable but at the tip of total remove from the scene he occupies. This is how the picture confronted me on my fifth reading. In my earlier attempts, I ignored it entirely. The anger within this drawing is all the more remarkable for how it can be shoved aside until the reader breathes life into it. The book concludes with a smile, one that, once more, throttles us back through the earlier graphics, casting new perspectives on all that we have just witnessed. The greatest works, in thought and in art, are not systematic but living organisms inviting participation of the heart and mind. With Misery of Love, what this final smile means can never be solved, but can be felt with increasing depth the more that is given to the book. The Devil's Grin Vol. 1 by Alex Graham I truly think this is one of the best comics of the past decade, maybe one of my favorite comics ever. With graphic novels as the dominant delivery system for comics going strong for over a decade, most GN's remain single-issue comic ideas stretched out to an undercooked 200 pages (or more). Devil's Grin is worth the pages it's printed on, there's no padding. And while it is long, ambitious and dense, this is a comic much more than it is a novel, its writing is in the drawing (a cliche we hear all the time in comics, but this book can explain the truth at the heart of the cliche) and I love how it's drawn. While certain panels don't match the hyper-perfection of alt comics at their most ascendant, there's no way anyone else besides Alex Graham could draw this: she gets the expressions exactly right in a way that a more "perfect" drawer could never do, all of Noel Sickles printed work (which I adore) combined can't equal the writing (and by that I mean comic drawings) that Graham's cartooning is built on. It's as if Graham figured out how to make the "great American alt comic" by synthesizing the approaches of alt comics literary ambitions with the "draw in your own way" mini-comic movement, which are more opposed than people think. If I was to show a panel from this work to a comics person who swears by the craft of, say, an Archer Prewitt, it may leave them cold. But Graham has, I believe, outdone so many cartoonists who wrestled with a dual loyalty to airtight craft and ambitions of "writerly" comics. Devil's Grin is wrestling with neither of those things, it lays down a gauntlet of its own excellence. Unlike your normal book-of-the-moment faux sensitivity, this work contains a level of emotional intelligence that so many cartoonists struggle to even approach let alone ever come to achieve. While there are intense/"transgressive" moments happening in Devil's Grin, this should not obscure that the book has, as its main focus, an investment in how people treat each other and a sense of moral clarity that most muddled graphic novels never even bother to broach. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard (and many more). Essay by Bill Kartalopoulos, Foreword by Ron Padgett. Looking at this new C Comics collection brought up some thoughts. Since the early '00s, poetry comics DID happen, but they did NOT happen in publications like Ink Brick. There is the famous Jean Cocteau quote about a child prodigy poet, Minou Drouet. When asked what he thought of her, Cocteau said "all children are poets, except Minou Drouet." That's how I feel about Ink Brick. All comics [have the potential to be] poetic, except those published in Ink Brick, comics that just graft cartooning onto outdated and conservative poetic forms. What's happening now, at the heart of comics fringes, is something different than simply breaking up a sentence over many panels and calling it "comics poetry." Instead, many young artists focus on publishing work that is a short exploration of a thought or a feeling, and this exploration unifies text and imagery in the pursuit of eliciting feeling from the reader. Instead of naturalistic fiction (which dominated alternative comic spaces in the '80s and '90s) we begin to see less and less focus on characters. Even autobio seems to be disintegrating. Self-publishing art cartoonists now often begin with an unnamed person speaking directly to the reader, with great focus on how such a person poses on the page, how they carry their weight. We see, in these kinds of comics, an avoidance of epiphany and an avoidance of resolution, though (crucially) without an avoidance of feeling. If we attempt to trace the origins of this, I'd say Doucet looms large, though I'd narrow her influence to before her concessions to alt comic conventions got the better of her (New York Diary and everything that came after, until her return to form with Time Zone J). In an early Doucet strip, called "Month of December," Doucet stands on a bridge and says "Christmas is coming." She sniffs her nose, "it's cold." In the final panel, she hurls herself off the bridge: "... and I'm gonna die?" That is the entire strip. Is it about suicide? Depression? Maybe, but no simple prosaic judgement can contain the strips power. So many emerging cartoonists work in this way today. This makes sense, as pure comics get at the core of poetry better than poetry itself could. Poetry strives to make expression new while working with an inherited set of symbols, the letters of the alphabet you write your poetry in. A comic like Doucet's goes farther, she does not write "I stood on the bridge and began to speak to you." She draws the bridge, her description of this specific bridge is already charged with a poetry that the letters themselves could never contain, no matter how you place them or rearrange them (all the tortured word placement of modernist poetry could have been solved, it seems, with drawing). Traditional cartoonists worked hard to make the bridge disappear. If Milton Caniff's story required him to draw a bridge, he'd do it perfectly, but so perfectly that you would not notice it or linger on it, the bridge merely a prosaic detail to connect point A to point B, no matter how proudly he drew it. Doucet allows the charge of her expression to be seen in every line, you ignore nothing, it's all part of the whole, just as nothing can be discarded or ignored in poetry. Doucet, and the generation that embraces her approach, is not like the group of avant-garde poets who made C Comics. Joe Brainard and his ilk lived and breathed what poetry was and is, they devoted their life to it. When they sought to make comics, the tools of poetic expression were already on call within them, and the tools were finely honed. The work in C Comics feels mature and exact, work made by people conscious of what they were doing. Poetry comics circa 2025 are most often made by those with no (or little) interest in orthodox poetry, but instead in how comics can be used for self expression. This search for how to use comics in a mature way has been subverted and derailed for a century. When someone taps into the poetic potential of comics, you see it happen on the page, you feel the charge, "finally, this is how it can be done!" Lately, I see this moment of conception everywhere, all the parts coming into place organically and the thrill of artistic gestalt happening in a way that it has really never happened before, the absolute triumph of raw artistic discovery. You'd think C Comics would connect to this, but it feels oddly distant, not so much a relative to today's explosion as it is an acquaintance who, if you come to think of it, you never actually met. And yet, despite this disconnect: as contemporary underground and fringe comics lean deeper into their poetic destiny, it is very important that this book is out now. C Comics is a tome that can now be corresponded with, there is enough strength in contemporary and organic poetic comics that the community making them won't be bulldozed by what is within this book ("it's already been done"). Instead it can act as a prophecy that you missed, and reading it now is exhilarating in its affirmation but not so influential as to change the flow of where we are already headed. Post Script: I haven't finished Melissa Mendes' The Weight yet, but I read the early chapters years ago and found them incredible. This list wouldn't be complete without mentioning this book that I look forward to reading in full in the new year. *** (articles) (top) I’ve been on a monthly comic embargo since I left high school, but 2025 was the year to reel me back in. Kieron Gillen and Caspar Wijngaard started knocking down the dominos they’ve been setting up for the past 10 issues of Power Fantasy. Christopher Priest's essays at the end of Marvel Knights: The World to Come have been just as engaging as Joe Quesada’s art. But without a doubt Absolute Martian Manhunter was the mainstream comic of the year. Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez are working in the Vertigo-tradition: reimagine a dusty DC IP, let the writer cram in as many purple prose captions as they need to describe the human condition, and pair them with an artist who can work outside the current house style. Probably their greatest achievement is making a comic with art that communicates instead of just illustrates. The fourth issue of the series starts with the cosmic-bringer of bad vibes known as “The White Martian” drawn like the silhouette on a men’s bathroom sign, with a black body and white circle head. In the next panel he lifts his head from his neck, then in the third he places it into the sky on the fourth panel, creating a heat wave that drives an entire city into a homicidal frenzy. Later in that same issue, the metaphorical enlightenment-golem known only as “The Martian” grabs a ray of white sunlight reflected in the protagonist’s eye, stretches it in his blocky hands, and separates it into three circular colors: red, green, and blue, the three colors that make up visible light. He overlaps the red and green–coincidentally the same colors used to signify the presence of The Martian throughout the comic–to create the color yellow, which he then places onto the city’s horizon as a setting sun, calming the madness and making everything right. It doesn’t make much sense explaining it, but you’ll love it when you see it. In the indie scene, I read some great stuff this year. Harper B’s Bring Me the Head of Susan Lomond was an extremely enjoyable one-shot that proves that funny comics usually have funny art. Corinne Halbert’s still finding fresh and funky ways to express her psychological journey to happiness in her newest installments of Scorpio Venus Rising. Audra Stang’s Another Year comics on Instagram are expanding the lore of Valley Valley and Idella Delle in tiny snippets that leave me wanting something longer. I also had the pleasure of picking up the first issue of Monograph Magazine at this year’s MICE Expo: a fanzine edited by Ivy Lynn Allie, E.B. Sciales, and Warren Bernard focusing on single panel cartoonists. This inaugural issue goes over the life of single panel cartoonist and first woman member of the National Cartoonists Society Hilda Terry. These were all small press triumphs, but if I had to choose a favorite indie of this year, I’m going with the obvious choice. I might be one of the four people currently reading Love and Rockets who’s closer in age to Tonta than Maggie. Life Drawing is the second trade starring Jaime’s new protagonist and her circle of friends/family. It’s nice to see Tonta get some breathing room after her last story, which felt like she was competing for attention with her pulpy family drama. Here we get an intergenerational crossover with Maggie and Ray while also getting to meet some of Tonta’s peers — I’m personally attached to the bug-eyed comic-lover Gomez, whose life feels closer to where I was at as a teenager than the more free-range Tonta. It’s a little disappointing that we only have 130 pages after ten years. Even two back-to-back weddings felt understated, but this collection gives the feeling that Jaime’s working up to something big. Until then, I’ll be reading and rereading what I have, just like with all of Jaime’s other comics. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a terrible year in many, many ways, but it was a great year for comics. Here's a dozen or so of my favorites from the past year: Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me: Mimi Pond's books are always great, and she just keeps getting better. Spent: Enter the Bechdelverse? Alternate reality Alison Bechdel hangs out in Vermont with the Dykes to Watch Out For cast and it's an amazing read. Raised by Ghosts: Briana Loewinsohn's been one of my favorite minicomics creators for years, and her graphic novels are even better. Life Drawing: Jaime Hernandez has been so consistently great for so long that people don't even comment on it when he drops another classic. The Love and Rockets curse. Absolute Batman: Extreme in all the best ways. Just a blast. Transformers: Another nostalgia trip, but a fun one. The '80s Transformers comic book we see in our heads when we think of what we were reading 40 years ago. The G.I. Joe and Void Rivals tie-ins from Skybound have been a lot of fun, too, and I'm glad that Larry Hama's still writing a monthly G.I. Joe comic and hope he gets to keep on doing that as long as he wants. You and Me on Repeat: Mary Shyne's debut graphic novel. Groundhog Day with teen angst and quantum mechanics in the mix. Looking forward to seeing what she does next. And to Think We Started as a Book Club ...: A best-of collection of New Yorker cartoons from Tom Toro, one of my favorite cartoonists from that magazine's 100-year run. Actual laugh-out-loud cartoons. Instagram cartoons from Joey Alison Sayers, Jeffrey Brown, Mike Dawson, Jen Sorensen, and Luke McGarry: I'm not on Instagram all that often, but the political, diary, and just-plain-weird comics from these artists help get me through the day. Ooops...I Just Catharted! 50 Years of Cathartic Comics: Terrific hardcover collection of unsung visionary Rupert Kinnard's Cathartic Comics from Stacked Deck Press. I hope this book leads to a reappraisal and renewed appreciation for his groundbreaking comics. The Essential Peanuts: Did we really need another Peanuts book? Of course we did! Mark Evanier on Charles Schulz with some all-star cartoonists sharing stories about the world's greatest comic strip. What's not to love? Almost Sunset: Wahab Algarmi's debut graphic novel has a lot of heart, and I think kids and parents will be reading this one and sharing it with friends and family for years to come. Top Two "conflict of interest" books of 2025: The Nefarious Nights of Willowweep Manor: The follow-up to Shaenon K. Garrity and Christopher Baldwin's hilarious The Dire Days of Willowweep Manor. Madcap hijinks for anyone who loves Agatha Christie and Jane Austen, or who's seen the Clue movie fifty times. I'd love for them to do a third book to make this a trilogy. Snoopy, The Story of My Life: The Myth, The Legend, The Beagle! Did we really need another Peanuts book? I must think so, or I wouldn't have written this one, Snoopy's autobiography, illustrated with classic Peanuts comic strips. I love the design, too, which looks and feels like a book I'd have checked out from my local library a hundred times as a kid. *** (articles) (top) I can’t remember how I got hung up on the Mitford sisters and their what-do-you-mean-one-of-them-was-a-duchess-and-one-was-a-Communist-and-two-were-literal-Nazis drama, though it probably started with reading Nancy’s gossipy biography of Enlightenment scientist Émilie de Châtelet, Voltaire in Love. And I’ve been a fan of Mimi Pond since … well, if it’s too glib to say “The Simpsons,” her two graphic memoirs about working at a diner in Oakland are fabulous, not to mention essential reading if you want to live in the Bay Area. So for me the event of the year, no contest, was Pond’s Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me. Pond’s cartooning is smart and witty and just weird enough to do the Milfords justice. Read with your jaw dropped from beginning to end. In other, non-Pond news, this was a great year for new artist debuts. Kayla E. came out of nowhere for me, which probably means I was looking in the wrong places, but Precious Rubbish blew me away. So did Yudori’s historical drama Raging Clouds, in different but equally powerful ways. Ben Wickey’s More Weight: A Salem Story is a towering achievement, but then there’s the quieter beauty of Lee Dean’s The Girl Who Flew Away. Finally, this is an amazing time for manga. We’re finally getting a lot of great older manga in translation, including The Legend of Kamui, Ashita no Joe, and, from secret essential comics publisher New York Review Books, Fumiko Takano's Miss Ruki. Takano is primarily an alternative manga artist, and if more of her work gets translated it will blow your brains out your ears. Gene Bride by Hitomi Takano is an amazing feminist sci-fi manga that I hope is getting the attention it deserves. Oh, and everything out of Smudge is a must-read for me because I cannot resist gross old manga, but this year’s Smudge standout is Shinichi Koga's Mansect. MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! Happy holidays! *** (articles) (top) My list of 3 favorites this year are all smart, tender stories that attend to the topic of growing up, but in very different ways. Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) Clever, distinct and devastating, the trauma and resilience of Li’l Kayla are delivered in a clean and spooky mid-twentieth-century comics frame. Through a dense intertextual web, Precious Rubbish expands and illuminates the potential of the form. Jelly Cake #2 by Stef Choi (self published, stefchoi.com) Animator-turned-cartoonist Stef Choi’s autobiographical coming-of-age comics are a delight. While other girls are donning thongs, tween Stef wears a homemade diaper-sized menstrual pad to school where she dodges racial epithets and pines only for nacho day and a boy named Michael Camaro. Cannon by Lee Lai (Drawn & Quarterly) When I finished reading Lee Lai’s book the first time, the words I chose to describe it were: “a rich story, elegantly told." The characters in this gorgeously rendered black and gray graphic novel are written with intricate, intersecting plot lines that explore family (both blood relations and queer-chosen), grief, growing up, repression, and rage. Watch for magpies, meditation, and plantar fasciitis. *** (articles) (top) We're all here on this end of year round up because we LOVE comics. I’m a comic book artist who also happens to work at a comic book shop. You can find me slinging books, Blu-rays, toys and more at legendary Sci-fi megastore & emporium, Forbidden Planet in NYC. These were the books that made the biggest impact on me this past year. Whether they made me think, grow a big smile on my face, laugh out loud or cry watery tears, these books had the GOODS. In no particular order, here's a selection of 20 outstanding works from 2025, in a medium I truly adore ... COMICS. Okay, okay, you got me. It's actually 21 comics. I tried and tried to make this list an even 20, alas some great stuff came out right at the end of the year and I couldn't leave any of these gems out. Without further adieu ... Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC! Still intensely thinking about it and I read this puppy WEEKS ago. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodríguez (DC Comics) I adore this series, Javier Rodríguez is a true visionary artist and his sense of color transcends realms. This team of creators is POWERFUL. Absolute Batman 2025 Annual #1 by Daniel Warren Johnson (DC Comics) HELL YES, get 'em! This was SO satisfying, DWJ gives the people what we want, this one-shot is truly OUTSTANDING. E Is for Edward: A Centennial Celebration of the Mischievous Mind of Edward Gorey by Gregory Hischak (Black Dog & Leventhal) This book is EXQUISITE. Getting to see smaller panels on huge page spreads brings me immeasurable joy, simply GORGEOUS. My Gorilla Family and Other Stories by Ichiro Iijima, translated by Ryan Holmberg (Living the Line) OBSESSED. This freshly translated 1970s horror manga anthology is absolutely bananas. It'll make you laugh, make you puzzled, and fill your heart with wonder and joy. Exquisite Corpses by James Tynion IV and more ...

This blew me away, I had no idea one of my favorite directors wrote this lushly illustrated, magnificent graphic novel all the way back in 1967. THANK YOU, Anthology Editions for bringing this astonishing tome back into the world.

The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard, foreword by Ron Padgett, essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books) Curious, adventurous, kooky and GROUNDBREAKING collaborative comics made by Joe Brainard and his New York School poet friends in the 1960s. *** (articles) (top) The usual caveat: I can’t keep up! The sheer variety of “comics,” its profusion of genres, formats, presses, and publishing sectors, frustrates any bid for comprehensiveness. Each year, I end up reading more of the year’s recommended comics after I file my list with TCJ than before, and even at Eisner-voting time (months later) I feel behind. My list this year, a score of titles, privileges book-length comics and publishers of same — no surprise, as it was a great year for such. Come springtime, I hope to compile a drastically revised best-of list. (Thanks to Nami for the manga tips!) Spent, by Alison Bechdel (Mariner Books). Colors by Holly Rae Taylor. If you can’t get out from under your reputation, why not spoof it? That logic seems to underlie Spent, a winking autofiction in which “Alison,” the character, gets rewritten, Fun Home gets parodied, and the prospect of its TV adaptation sparks a nervous comedy. Spent boasts, besides Alison and her partner Holly, a community of characters from Dykes to Watch Out For. As Alison suffers from creative block, struggling with a memoir-in-progress about consumer capitalism, the larger cast steers the story into funny, humane territory. Self-indulgent? I’d say loving and ingenious: a playful, inevitably political time capsule of this moment. Kaya #24-31, by Wes Craig (Image Comics). Colors by Jason Wordie. As I said two years ago, Kaya is a familiar sort of story: a postapocalyptic quest starring two super-powered kids, mismatched siblings, one of whom is a prophesied Chosen One. Together they rove, and together they fight robots and monsters. I know, I know. But Craig has been running flat-out from the starting gun, topping himself again and again with pages of thrilling inventiveness and moments of surprising emotional oomph. The sister/brother conflict is credible, the psychic stakes complicated, and the world-building crazed. Even the robots have problems. Craig’s drawing and Wordie’s coloring go hand in glove. Pure, craftilicious pleasure. Goes Like This, by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics). Crane’s best work tends to be elegant yet anxious: classic cartooning with desperate emotional undercurrents. Muted but astringent, his comics mix graphic classicism with existential terror; at the same time, the work is gorgeously swoon-worthy. This curiously designed volume (with varied paper stocks, an exposed spine, and visible stitching) gathers in more than a quarter century of comics and prints, walking a tightrope between narrative understatement and visual splendor. Compulsive worry and quiet dread are delivered with severe narrative control and deadpan pacing, but also ravishing color. The book is both a printer’s orgy and a masterclass in holistic design. Mike Dawson's Monthly Minicomic Club, by, yep, Mike Dawson (self-published subscription service via Patreon). Dawson lives up to his motto, “self-publishing is a power,” every month. Though he has many graphic novels to his name, and another forthcoming, his zine/minicomic service is the heart of his work. Each month he sends out a mini (usually digest- or CD jewel case-size), typically an observational slice of life riffing on pop culture (Hamilton, Stranger Things, Queen), sometimes from a bemused dad’s perspective, often politically charged. Dawson happily mocks himself, and embarrassed recollections of his younger self are constant. The work is somehow both high-spirited and contemplative, in a rounded, fat-lined, insanely readable cartoony style. I’m hooked. FML #3-6, by Kelly Sue DeConnick, David López, Cris Peter, and Clayton Cowles (Dark Horse). This apocalyptic, vaguely semiautobio sitcom set in Portland may be the best comic book DeConnick has written (and that’s saying something). A breathless farce about schoolmates and bandmates, and then again the agitated adults around them, most especially a tensely wired yet lovable punk-rock mom, FML nails the nightmarish, post-COVID, Trumpian world we now inhabit. Each issue hijacks different genres and piles on new absurdities, some all too painfully real. Artist López is assured and delightful, managing the chaos with loving inventiveness. This series fairly screams “passion project,” and, like a costume party at an ICE stakeout, gives me hope. Muybridge, by Guy Delisle (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Helge Dascher and Rob Aspinall. Delisle’s latest, tonally deadpan yet graphically sharp as usual, recounts not only the career of Eadweard Muybridge and the invention of chronophotography but also the dawning of photography in general and even of cinema. Basically, Delisle treats Muybridge as the missing link between photography and moving pictures. At the same time, his Muybridge is no hero; Delisle stays detached and ironical, treating the man’s trials and wrongdoings (even the committing of murder) matter-of-factly. There’s no pathos in Muybridge’s decline and death, but you can tell that Delisle is fascinated. Ingenious and insinuating — a rare feat of explanation and oblique commentary. Precious Rubbish, by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). This is one of the most harrowing memoirs I’ve read. Kayla E. adapts layouts and drawings from roughly mid-century children’s comics, turning them into templates for a terrifying story of familial dysfunction and incestuous abuse. Taking up the aseptic formalism of Chris Ware, she goes even further, into drawing that is frankly stilted and repetitive, full of exactly repeated poses that give her pages a sort of Colorforms aesthetic. Filtering awful details through this insulating formalism, the book elicits feelings of helplessness, rage, and horror. This feels like triumph of self-understanding and release, as well as, perhaps, righteous vindication. Astonishing. Checked Out, by Katie Fricas (Drawn & Quarterly). Checked Out follows a young queer cartoonist and librarian in NYC as she researches an impossible project, navigates a funky workplace, and endures breakups and loneliness. Its 350 pages blow by like a bullet train, funny and fearless, in a sloppy-looking, ostensibly deskilled style that’s actually quite skillful and evocative (comparisons: early Groening? Allie Brosh?). The book’s offhand manner belies its pinpoint observations and droll self-awareness. I read most of it standing up, in one long, flow-state session. It’s that kind of trip. Smart as hell, and touching, with an ending that makes failure (by standard measures) look like victory. Life Drawing, by Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics). This latest collection from Xaime compiles comics that were already great as a serial (in Love & Rockets). I enjoy re-reading them in one go. Here, two of Xaime’s signature characters, middle-aged Maggie and younger Tonta, are on a collision course, in humorous vignettes that bring out their foibles, vulnerabilities, and assumptions (while also eavesdropping on many other believable characters: the usual miraculous repertory cast). Xaime has a talent for reintroducing characters you think you know from unexpected angles, and he does that here, oh so slyly. The results are droll, charming, and moving – and, of course, cartooned to perfection. Mansect, by Shinichi Koga (Smudge/Living the Line). Translated by Ryan Holmberg. Social outliers literally turn into bugs in this round-robin story of contagion, metamorphosis, and, naturally, body horror: an antetype of Junji Ito’s work, or, if you like, Charles Burns’ Black Hole. Childish bodies age and shrivel suddenly; people are swallowed; an infant feeds on its mother. One victim leads to another in a chain, and pseudoscientific rationalizations cannot quell the nauseating unease. Holmberg and Smudge do heroic service here, translating Koga’s creepy mid-Seventies manga into one handsome, icky volume. The grotesque imagery will eat you up from the inside. Oddly, I enjoyed this, and thought about it a lot afterward! Raised by Ghosts, by Briana Loewinsohn (Fantagraphics). This delicate, flickering book, a semiautobio reverie, evokes a 1990s girlhood via discreet, emotionally subtle comics, punctuated by revealing passages of diaristic prose (journal entries, notes-to-self) that appear as artifacts or scraps interleaved throughout. Bri’s handwritten notes grant her relief from a broken family and frightfully quiet house (her parents are heard but never seen). Loewinsohn, however, avoids overstatement, preferring muted pathos and poetic bemusement. Just over halfway through, Bri falls into a long dream, a visual tour de force, and the book shifts, ending on a surprising note of affirmation. The story is entirely Bri’s, inward, subdued, and immersive. Surrounded: America’s First School for Black Girls, 1832, by Wilfrid Lupano and Stéphane Fert (NBM). Translated by Montana Kane. Surrounded (originally Blanc autour, Dargaud, 2020) recounts the founding, growth, and eventual destruction, but also lingering influence, of Prudence Crandall’s academy for young women of color in Canterbury, Connecticut. Lupano’s scenario mixes scrupulous research with speculative elements, including symbolic characters whose voices amplify radical and feminist perspectives. Fert’s Mary Blair-influenced art is delicate but vigorous, cartoony yet historically anchored. The tale continually underscores the ambient threat of racist violence (sadly fulfilled in the end), yet the telling is discreet and the lead characters irrepressible. Ably translated, with an informative afterword by the Prudence Crandall Museum, this deserves a brighter spotlight. Land of Mirrors, by María Medem (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Aleshia Jensen and Daniela Ortiz. A lone woman tends a lone flower in a lonely, unpeopled landscape. The flower gives her purpose and pleasure, but anxiety too. Unexpectedly, a stranger befriends her and leads her to a land of sociable if vague people who surround themselves with mirrors. Among them, she feels joy, release, but also distrust. This Spanish fable about aloneness and community is narratively elusive and abstract, yet formally exquisite, built out of delicate linework, intensive patterning, braided symbols, and otherworldly, psychedelic color. The formalism recalls John Hankiewicz, the palette Peter Max, but Medem is unique. I restarted this the moment I finished. Tongues, Vol. 1, by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon). Tongues modernizes the Prometheus myth on a grand scale, yet in cool, crystalline, and disorienting style. An unnamed prisoner (our Prometheus) has his guts eaten out by raptors, over and over; gradually, the prisoner and his torturers learn to converse. Meanwhile, a young woman on the run may just kill the king of the gods. Anomic human functionaries (mercenaries, drifters) scurry around in the gods’ orbit; the very cancellation of humanity may be imminent, and the wastes of war are everywhere. Hypnotically designed and colored, Tongues boasts pages the likes of which I’ve never seen. It’s also bracing and prophetic. A Song for You & I, by K. O’Neill (RH Graphic). This middle-grade GN is quintessential O’Neill: a pastoral, pseudo-medieval coming-of-age fantasy with anticapitalist, communitarian vibes. Here, a headstrong ranger-in-training (with a flying horse!) makes a bad decision, then must atone by aiding a young shepherd/musician. Each helps the other overcome their shyness and regrets. I didn’t recognize the assigned gender of one of the characters until quite late, but that’s fitting; gendered self-recognition is key. The novel’s quiet treatment of trauma and self-doubt echoes O’Neill’s Tea Dragon series, but with more breathing room for spare, decompressed storytelling (and fetching, Miyazaki-esque art). A lovely dispatch from a great body of work. Black Arms to Hold You Up, by Ben Passmore (Pantheon). Satirical and didactic, this graphic novel depicts generations of Black resistance to white racism. Passmore writes with his usual offhand wit but also an aggrieved heart and new tenderness. Protagonist “Ben,” cynical and despairing, gets unstuck in time as his father takes him on a tour of Black history, starting with the betrayal of Reconstruction and coming right up to now. Passmore never ducks complexity; his portrayals of militants and communities are often mocking and sharp. But he’s never cheap. Ben ultimately embraces what he has been dodging, in a finale blending rage, love, and even hope. Epochal, beautiful, brilliant. King-Cat Comics and Stories No. 84, by John Porcellino (self-published). John P.’s King-Cat is a pillar of my reading life: a periodic gift that blends love, loss, anecdote, and reflection. His cartooning is beautifully spare and perfectly attuned to what he has to say. Every issue moves me. This latest one is particularly sad, saying goodbye to old friends (human and critter) and to his mom. I felt sad for John while reading it. Then again, it also made me smile and, once, even laugh out loud. Childhood memories, everyday busyness, Zen parables, an isometric diagram of his own bed (mournful and funny) – once again, it’s a complex, full-hearted treasure. The Legend of Kamui, Vols. 1 and 2, by Sanpei Shirato (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, and Alexa Frank. I first read Shirato in the Viz/Eclipse Kamui floppies of the late 1980s. These impressed me with their historical texture, Marxist critique of class, and stoic brutality. They were bracing. Turns out they were translations of Kamui Gaiden from the 1980s, not the legendary Kamui Den serialized in Garo in the 1960s. This sumptuous new D&Q series adapts (at last!) the Sixties work, with much drawing by Shirato’s assistant, Goseki Kojima. The plot is long and tangled, and the tone, unsurprisingly, downbeat and fierce. Kamui himself is just one player in the sprawling cast. Astringent comics: tough-minded, tragic, but grand. Ashita No Joe: Fighting for Tomorrow, Vols. 2 and 3, by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba (Vertical). Translated by Annelise Ogaard. This classic manga is a troubled story of aspiration and hunger with a melodramatic, utterly committed style. It follows Joe, an indigent young boxer, proud, belligerent, and rash; his mentor Danpei, a washed-up, alcoholic ex-prizefighter reliving past glories through Joe; and Rikiishi, a more clinical boxer on whom Joe fixates as rival and nemesis. Their rivalry starts in a reformatory (this is also a prison story) but ramps up when Riikishi and Joe get out of stir. Joe is often genuinely unlikable, an asshole really, yet I’m compelled to root for his rise. An addictive cocktail of violence and pathos. Ginseng Roots, by Craig Thompson (Pantheon). Craig Thompson’s best book-length comic, inspired by his childhood experience working in the ginseng fields of rural Wisconsin. Wildly ambitious and self-contradictory, it’s at once a revisiting (and partial repudiation) of his breakout book Blankets, a study in how agribusiness (in this case ginseng farming) shapes everyday life, and an excuse for globetrotting journalism. Thompson’s unguarded earnestness (practically a badge he wears) belies the rigor and intelligence of this sprawling, uncategorizable book, in which luscious brushwork collides with diagrammatic infographics and Thompson delivers some of the most gorgeous comics pages I’ve seen. I reviewed this for TCJ back in July. Absolute Wonder Woman #4-14, by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Jordie Bellaire, and Becca Carey, et al. (DC). Tegan O’Neil digs this comic, and so do I. I don’t care about DC’s “Absolute” line, but this series remains their brightest jewel, a badass remix of Wonder Woman that feels more alive and radical than almost any other WW comics since Marston. At first, I thought the pitch (WW as a sorceress raised in Hell) was stupid, but boy I was wrong — as I said last year! The issues with fill-in artists (subbing for Sherman) are less awesome, reminding me of the genre’s strict clockwork and aesthetic patchiness, but they’re still good. My favorite superhero comic of recent years. The Ephemerata, by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). This study in grief makes for a stunning exhibition of organic, inky drawing — cartooning dug and chiseled from the hard stuff of life. Its beauty underscores its weirdness: starting out as a Bunyanesque allegory about dwelling in “Griefville,” it builds a quirky mythos out of private, hermetic symbols, but then settles into literal autobiography of a sort familiar from Tyler’s past work. As usual, Tyler pours everything she has into the work, every shock, ache, and loss. The results are wayward and bemusing (like three books knotted into one, really) but also staggering in their flinty honesty and wise reflection. Mushishi Collector’s Edition, Vol. 1, by Yuki Urushibara (Kodansha USA). Translated by Andres Oliver. There’s a whiff of Kitaro and Black Jack about this weird early-2000s manga that follows the wanderings of a cool, laconic man of mystery. Yet the mood is different: sad, curious, quietly restive. Ginko is an itinerant mushishi: an expert in mushi, strange, protean beings mostly unseen by humans that nonetheless impinge on human hosts, imparting both strange powers and tragic burdens. Are mushi like germs? Are they like ghosts? Ginko, knowledgeable and aloof, serves as a go-between, Kitaro-style, solving (or sometimes failing to solve) problems caused by mushi infestations. Beautiful, eerie, and full of confounding dilemmas and haunted characters. Clementine Book 3, by Tillie Walden Walden has invested so much in this Walking Dead trilogy that, for me, its franchise origins fall away. The whole series is good, but the last book stuns. Here Clementine, her partner, and friends settle into a semi-utopian refuge, which Walden then complicates in a most disconcerting, anti-utopian way. Two conflicting leaders, both powerful women, clash over how the community should be protected. Meanwhile, Clementine is blindsided by grief. The role of violence in securing utopia is one of the reigning themes; what might happen to you when you trade human vulnerability for armored strength is another. Soulful and haunting. Comic Arts Los Angeles, Dec. 13-14, 2025. Not a comic, a festival. CALA has become the pivot in my comics year (which, I now see, runs from roughly May to May). When CALA was on hiatus (2020-2023), I missed it. This year was as wonderful as last: I got to see friends and favorite artists, host a panel, and learn about art and artists new to me. Many of my comics friends feel as if there’s a gushing firehose of mediocrity these days, and little of interest, but I disagree; seeking out new comics continues to be a joy. CALA amplifies that joy. Thanks, organizers and volunteers! *** (articles) (top) LAAB #3 by Ronald Wimberly, et. al. (Beehive Books) Apparently the final issue of Ronald Wimberly's political-cultural broadsheet-broadside, this time putting comics visuals from Tradd Moore and Celine Loup and others next to long essays in tiny print you read by wrestling the publication upside down. Comics as street literature, in a delivery vehicle you might fold into a paper airplane and throw at your local reactionary. American Reaper Book One by Pat Mills, Clint Langley, Fay Dalton (Millsverse Comics) An old Judge Dredd Megazine series collected and self-published by co-creator Pat Mills. There's some art by the unjustly ignored Fay Dalton, but the strip is dominated — indeed detonated — by the work of Clint Langley, whose pages of digitally activated fumetti images feel like putting your head inside a fan oven and enjoying it. On top of revisiting how Langley was augmenting comics with software in 2011, the book now forces you to reckon with what someone possessing one inch of Langley's gifts might type into ChatGPT hoping to reverse up the same road and get to this destination the easy way. Essential Judge Anderson: Childhood's End by Alan Grant, Kev Walker et al (Rebellion) Rebellion's eternal reprinting program presents (again) Psi-Judge Cassandra Anderson in 1993's Childhood's End, Alan Grant and Kev Walker's Chariots of the Gods on Mars number. For my money this is a bigger artistic deal than the near-contemporary stories drawn by Arthur Ranson which have become the anointed classics. Writer Grant's solo custody of Cassandra Anderson for 25 years was 2000 AD's greatest achievement that no one talks about, plotting a coherent course for her as a telepathic seeker who could still execute people in terrible ways without hesitation. This Essential volume adds Grant's final Anderson stories from much, much later, which are short and unhappy and repetitive and depressingly shallow, because by then the editor had clearly told him to knock all that off. Kirby at Marvel 1956-1963 by Michael Hill (self-published) Doctor Strange: A Decade of Dark Magic by Stuart Moore (Marvel/Bloomsbury) One of these is a self-published painstaking appraisal of Jack Kirby's grand achievements in the run-up to and aftermath of Fantastic Four #1, collated from primary and secondary sources plus modern community discussion and much peering at the actual art with a microscope, an extension of Michael Hill's According to Kirby blog. The absolute flaying of Stan Lee along the way reads Lee's creative shortcomings as personality flaws, springboards from there to his sexism and racism, and parallels the dogged persistence of Stan Lee exceptionalism with the number of people prepared to vote for Donald Trump. The other book reviews the first ten years of Doctor Strange comics from a fan-turned-pro's perspective, and indeed from Marvel's perspective since it published this via Bloomsbury. Being Ditko-adjacent compels Stuart Moore to mention the artist's "eccentric sociopolitical views," but that's blistering criticism compared with the glad hand offered to Stan Lee. A concluding anecdote from SDCC circa 2015 reports no shadow of The Man's late-life hassles as he twinkles in full magic grandpa mode, "a thoughtful man taking decades of criticism to heart." As with that bonkers official Stan Lee documentary, whether this is true or not is secondary to its role in brand management. The Jigsaw Review #1 edited by Mal Earl (Gweni Press) The start of an intended archival anthology series reprinting material from the UK's 1980s and 1990s small-press and indie circuits, which is almost terra incognita compared to the well-mapped things happening in North America at the same time. The Complete Crepax Volume #9 by Guido Crepax (Fantagraphics) If things had run to the original plan, which was ten annual volumes from February 2016, then 2025 would have brought the final one and the conclusion of the whole vast Crepax reprint project. Some bumps in the road have led to this year actually bringing book #9 of 12 instead. It would be fair to say the series has had its longueurs. But Volume #9 storms out of the gate, every strip crackling with sensual static. The four stories about Crepax's Anita character work as erotica and 1970s social commentary and horror fiction and the indulgences of a man drawing naked ladies, all caught in the turbulence of Crepax's artwork, trying to suggest what the sexy feels like not just looks like. How exactly does Crepax wring such demonic erotic mood from a little portable TV before a horny Anita starts copulating with it? How does he conjure Anita's self-destructing climax blasting the machine to bits, a smoking ruin between her thighs? You could stare at the pages for an hour and still not be on top of things. Mandala by Andy Barron (The Mansion Press) Love and death and resurrection in silent black-comedy melodrama and blazing Risograph-effect colors. On first read I thought the three main characters were Adam, Eve and Satan; but they might be id, ego and superego. Barron knows comics: the punch ups are all Kirby poses and power, and having ascended to orbit prior to a ballistic descent like Superman, the male-coded Um surveys a bulbous Kirby kosmos, asteroid belts and all. *** (articles) (top) I've been a die hard fan of the work of scénariste Alain Ayroles ever since I moved to France. This year, amongst other things, he released the final volume of the 'first cycle' of the intriguing L'Ombre des Lumières series, a transatlantic homage to Choderlos de Laclos' famous novel Les Liaisons dangereuses (and who could forget the film staring John Malkovich, Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer!) The writing, albeit in French, is magnifique and the artwork solidly supplied by Richard Guérineau who gives as much life to bleak colonial North America as he does the manicured lawns of 18th Century France. Ayroles uses extracts from letters written by the protagonists as a narrative device throughout, keeping you guessing as to who wrote what, to whom, and why at each instance. I shall not reveal the denouement — because I haven't actually finished reading it yet! *** (articles) (top) One book that really stood out for me this year was Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez, which blends mind-bending trippiness with a totally bonkers and heartfelt alternate version of DC's green Superman cipher. The best of the Absolute line from last year (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman) subverted expectations of the characters while still maintaining their defining core elements, while Camp's cerebral script and Rodriguez's experimental layouts and visual storytelling take it further to flip the script on the genre itself. If DC expands this for another six issues I'm there for them. *** (articles) (top) Like every year, I read a lot of things in 2025. Almost all of them were quite old. In no particular order, here are a few things that came out this past year that provided some relief from the chaos of the real world … Crickets #9, Sammy Harkham. An absolutely stunning cover and, as always, gorgeous art and compelling storytelling. My copy came with the incredibly cool bonus Hayseed zine, which is filled with sketches, notes, etc. Sammy is consistently one of the very best. Precious Rubbish, Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). All of the praise and attention that has been directed toward this gut-wrenching masterpiece is well deserved. I was lucky enough to read this brutal memoir during the process of its creation and knew it would be something special. Here’s an interview Mark Newgarden and I did with Kayla about the book for The Comics Journal. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life, Dan Nadel (Scribner). An utterly fascinating read that sets the bar high for biographies about living cartoonists, and controversial figures, generally. If you know very little about Crumb, it’s a great book. If you think you know everything — or at least all you need to know — about him, it’s an ever better book because you will learn much more. Crumb is certainly not for everyone, but for those seeking to learn just how he came to be the person he is, it’s all here. Here is an interview I did with the author about the process of making the book. Mineshaft #46. Another great issue of my favorite magazine. This one has amazing front and back covers by Drew Friedman, an interview (about death) with Robert Crumb, and many pages of great work by Noah Van Sciver, Simone Baumann, Christoph Mueller, Sammy Harkham, Aaron Horkey, David Collier, Robert Armstrong, Glenn Head, James Collier, Tony O'Neill, Jose Arroyo, William Crook Jr., Max Clotfelter, Billy Childish, and Joost Halbertsma. The Art of Lale Westvind. I have many of these Banzai Collection monthly anthologies and love them all. This one presents many pages of Lale’s wonderful art and has a very cool poster included as well. Banzai is really doing a great job curating important work by amazing artists that serve as great introductions to historical bodies of work. Smoke Signal 44 - Gary Panter Solo Issue. A 32-page tabloid full of Gary Panter’s art. If you were lucky enough to get your hands on one of these, hold onto it. It’s a thing of beauty. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly). A complex story involving historic sisters (who I had never heard of before the book arrived), this is a wonder–Every page is something to stare at for quite a while. As Tammi Morton-Kelly wrote in The Comics Journal, Mimi “delivers a luminous portrait of the Mitford sisters, a family whose charm and contradictions have garnered a rabid cult following.” Read the full interview here. Lattaland #4, Josh Latta. I really Josh's series of nasty gag panel comics, but this one contains something different. A personal story about his dying father set in a nursing home during the holidays. Leo Derek – In the Heart of Danger, James Stewart & Joshua Stewart. This actually came out … a while ago. It’s a 40-year-old treasure that has been unearthed. Definitely worth gawking at. It’s one of the many fantastic offerings from the new indy comics distributor Power Pulp. The Smythes, Rea Irvin, edited and with an introduction by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw, afterword by Caitlin McGurk (New York Review Books). Like many, I would imagine, the only thing I knew about Irvin’s The Smythes were the couple of pages in Bill Blackbeard’s Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics (1977). Johnson and Shaw collect more than 160 of Irvin’s gorgeous pages that show off his wit and subtle humor. ou can read Tammi's analysis of the book for The Comics Journal here. Scorpio Venus Rising #4, Corinne Halbert. Every page is great. Read a TCJ interview with the very talented Corinne here. The Complete C Comics, Joe Brainard, with a foreword by Ron Padgett and essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books). People can finally see for themselves the two volumes of obscure art comics that Brainard — and a host of collaborators — cooked up and self-published in the 1960s. HYPE*PUPjr, Frank Santoro. Frank's latest issue of his zine, which served as a recap of his inaugural Destination Dealers Con held here in Pittsburgh in November, took almost two years to come out. And this may be it for Frank's monthly color broadsheet. I'll miss getting these in the mail if that's true. They remind me of hardcore punk singles from the early '80s somehow. Hopefully all 48 issues will be collected some day. The Ephemerata, Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). A beautiful book about a troubling subject, but one that we all must face. Carol spent many years — and hours at the drawing board — charting out her thought about grief to create her most ambitious book yet. Also, I had the great fortune to get a sneak peek at a few things by some of my favorite artists. I’ve read a bunch of the penciled pages for Kim Deitch’s work-in-progress tentatively titled, Living the Dream, and cannot wait for this one to come out. What I’ve read are autobiographical pages about his breaking into underground comix and they are wonderful. I’ve also read a chunk of Jim Woodring’s mind-blowing take on the style and format of a 1930s Big Little Book, Quacky. It’s nuts in all the best ways and unlike any Frank story you’ve ever read. Jim perfectly captures the awkward narration of those books and gives them his own strange twist. That’s it for now. Stay safe everyone, and try to stay sane. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman and Absolute Martian Manhunter proved the cape-and-tights crowd might still have some life left in them. Peter Kuper’s Insectopolis explained the importance of nature’s creepy-crawlies. Mattie Lubchansky avoided the sophomore slump with Simplicity. Don’t let the colors and layouts fool you, Kayla E’s Precious Rubbish made for bracing reading. Patchwork by Kate Evans sewed together the threads of Jane Austen’s life. Ben Passmore’s Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance dramatized undertold episodes from American history. Yazan Al-Saadi’s Lebanon is Burning and Other Dispatches had relevance in this year of ceasefires where the firing never ceased. Finally, Taha Siddiqui and Hubert Maury’s The Dissident Club combined combing of age story and political thriller. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was strange: I witnessed a cultural reset that felt like a complete assault on my senses. Rhian Teasdale, the lead singer of Wet Leg, wearing a shirt that says, “Men are so back” is a good visual summary of this past year, and I’ve been coping by simultaneously gorging on junk food (rom-coms, reality TV) and healthy meals (books, good comics). As the gender divide gets deeper and discourse becomes rife with binary thinking, I found comfort in work that wasn’t afraid of ambiguity; that encouraged conversation and discourse, especially from a unique point-of-view. Here were some of the bright spots during an otherwise confusing and weird year: Do Admit! The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly): A 440-page historical graphic biography and memoir about the Mitfords, a noble British family of six eccentric sisters who were highly active in politics during the 20th century. Pond worked on this book for six years and it shows: Do Admit! is a marvel of research, writing, and drawing. Pond’s expert hand produces a light and breezy line, while dimensions and details are rendered in a Prussian Blue ink wash: her drawings are just as charming as they are immersive. While reading the book, I realized it somewhat disturbingly functions as a mirror to the present day as it recounts the history of fascism through the female perspective. As it becomes weirder and weirder to be a woman each and every day, I take solace in Decca (Jessica) Mitford’s story, who became a prominent muckraker and civil rights activist despite her gender and family’s conservative politics, making me believe that if she could do it, maybe we all aren’t so doomed after all. The Ephemerata by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics): The first Carol Tyler comic I read was “Uncovered Property” (1987) from Crumb’s Weirdo #20, in which she weaves in a subtle statement about gender dynamics through a funny childhood anecdote. Tyler has continued to explore her family in her decades-long cartooning career, culminating in The Ephemerata, the first installment of a two-part graphic memoir detailing a decade in which she experienced many deaths in quick succession. The book is breathtakingly rendered with deliberate crosshatching that reminds me of Tove Jansson; I have never seen anyone draw trees like Tyler can. Though the journey through Griefville can be painful (I did cry while reading this book), The Ephemerata has a relatable candor that will make readers who have also experienced significant loss feel seen. Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank (New York Review of Comics): This is a complete collection of Fumiko Takano’s “Miss Ruki” comics, which appeared monthly in Japanese woman’s magazine, Hanako, from 1988-1992. These full-color, 2-page comics are about Ruki and Ecchan, two women exploring their newfound freedom as working professionals in Japan’s 1980s economic bubble. The book serves as a happy antidote to my overstimulated eyes, and it is no surprise that Otomo and Matsumoto were huge fans. Miss Ruki boasts clear lines, simple pastel colored palettes, and minimal yet well-balanced backgrounds. Most radically, Takano uses her comic as a vehicle for critique of this rapidly changing time in Japan: I think of the comic from April 9, 1992, where Ecchan calls Ruki for help with her brand new rice cooker. Ecchan uses her cordless phone to contact Ruki with ease, but Ruki, still using a corded phone, humorously runs back and forth from her rice cooker to her phone to give Ecchan the instructions; making me think about how when technology makes our lives easier, faster, and more efficient, we begin to revere the minor inconveniences of yesterday. Kus #54 ‘It’s All Good!!!’, anthology edited by Caroline Cash (Kus): Cash’s editorial voice in this full-color 160-page pocket-sized anthology is best captured through her contribution to the book, “Drunk Girls”, an autobiographical comic about an off-kilter encounter in the dive bar bathroom. Featuring 20 international cartoonists, Kus #54’s comics observe the quotidian through an absurd Larry David-esque, yet emotionally intelligent, lens. I loved the comics by Tara Booth, Anand, Jurijs Tatarkins, and Leo Fox. My favorites include: “Magic Novice” by Emma Hunsinger, a story that uses magical realism to explore the nature of love; “Double Trouble” by Vivianna Maria Stanislavska, a comedic yet existential exploration of work, life, and death; and “Jessica” by Margot Sounack, who defines the “Jessica poster effect” during a drunken party that is beautifully rendered in pencil and marker. Akin to her own visual voice, Cash has curated a simultaneously thought-provoking and gut-busting reading experience in Kus #54. Hairspray Magazine #1, anthology edited by Karla Paloma (Self-published): Printed in black and white and featuring 10 international contributors, Hairspray Magazine features comics centered on the female experience, especially sex— Paloma’s editorial vision is simultaneously grotesque and accessible, making the anthology feel like a worthy companion to Chevli and Farmer’s Tits & Clits. My personal favorites from this anthology include “Me and my Bouffant” by Martina Sarritzu, “The Terrible Story of my Hair” by Noemie Barsolle, and perhaps the funniest one of the book, “The New Carreer” by Simone F. Baumann, whose visual style reminds me of the late Aline Kominsky-Crumb’s — a 9-pager about a woman leaving her publishing career to become a sex worker. Bold, defiant, and capturing the spirit of underground comix, Hairspray Magazine won “Best Alternative Comic” at the 2025 Angouleme Comics Festival, and I’m looking forward to the next issue debuting January 2026. Prop Comic by Veronica Graham (Most Ancient): A feminist reimagining of Popeye in the form of a broadsheet 20-page minicomic: Instead of Popeye, what if Olive Oyl was the main character? Through dizzyingly creative page layouts that brings to mind the idiosyncratic compositions of Chris Ware, Graham presents Olive as an avatar to explore our modern day anxieties about digital communication, the economy, and relationships. Artfully poetic, I always discover something new when I re-read this comic. Szarolatka by Jas Hice (Frog Farm): An 80-page risograph minicomic about a young mother whose life becomes upended by a strange neighbor.Beautifully printed in Federal Blue and Red, Hice’s visual language is simultaneously playful and somber; making their depiction of femme-specific experiences, such as objectification and motherhood, refreshingly accessible and a pleasure to read. I haven’t seen anyone depict femme interiority with such subtle mastery as Hice does. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram Books): A risograph minicomic depicting a surreal, psychedelics-fueled horror story about friendship and creative passion. Myers’s storytelling is poetic yet sincere, and her art exhibits a virtuosic talent for inking. There is an amazingly jaw-dropping spread near the end that I think about every now and then. I hope Myers makes comics forever. Wedding Juice, Issue 3 by Sanika Phawde (Self-published): I was lucky to get a sneak peek of the third installment of this Ignatz award-winning series at Gutter, a Brooklyn-based comic reading show hosted by Clar Angkasa and Mikey Maiden, back in June 2025. Wedding Juice is an autobiographical series that depicts the days before an Indian-American wedding. In this issue, Phawde uses bold colors and unique camera angles to show the hijinks that ensue when figuring out “wedding underwear” and “wedding priest” (you will have to read it to find out more!). Wedding Juice is distinct in its charming, empathetic, and humorous approach in depicting the cross-cultural experience– I’m excited for Issue 4. Tarwar by Ilan Manouach (Nero Editions): I stumbled upon this book at Printed Matter and was immediately drawn to its formal qualities: a black cover with its title in rainbow holographic letters, fuschia endpapers, and interior pages full of black panels that transform speech bubbles, onomatopoeias, and motion lines into main characters. Tarwar is a collection of black panels collected from millions of digitized comics across various countries and genres. Captivated by its aesthetic appeal, I purchased it immediately. Upon further research, I learned about Manouach’s conceptual approach to comics, which makes him no stranger to scrutiny, including of course, here at TCJ. Controversy aside (I’d rather eat glass than talk about AI Art), Tarwar is a beautiful book that fits perfectly in Manouach’s catalog as it asks more questions than it answers. Is it poetry? Is it theft? Is it art? Is it even … a comic?? For me, the only thing I can answer is that Manouach’s work scratches that navel-gazing itch that art school unfortunately trained into me. *** (articles) (top) No time for explanations or exclamatory descriptions! Too many holiday things to do! Here, in no particular order, are 10 of my favorite comics this year:2 Honorable mention: Absolute Martian Manhunter, Miss Ruki, The Smythes, The Once and Future Riot, Roy #1, Holy Lacrimony *** (articles) (top) I’ll start with Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang, since it deals directly with the spiritual rot of resentment and self-loathing predictably bred by popularity contests, artistic or otherwise. Evocative, discontinuous one-page vignettes cluster around a rivalry between the two title characters; Valley (at one point shown ice skating) is the Tonya Harding to Idella’s Nancy Kerrigan. Stang’s cartooning is pared down and punchy, served well here by each page having its own rich two-color Riso palette, courtesy a knockout print job by Frog Farm head honcho Alexander Laird. The story is littered with screens, mirror images, and projections of both the electronic and psychological variety, while the zine itself is a material argument in favor of printing and binding. I first became aware of Suerynn Lee at a panel of New Yorker cartoonists at the Art Students League early last year. The organizers ran a slideshow of the participants’ cartoons on a screen overhead while the panelists talked, and Lee’s had a depth and bite the others seemed to lack. Later Lee revealed that she alone among the panelists started making each cartoon by drawing rather than writing. Now, I think Chris Ware was onto something when he said that “allowing one’s drawings to suggest the direction of a story is comics’ single greatest formal advantage,” and by all appearances Lee makes full use of that advantage. The drawings in her zine Two Snakes (published by Christina Lee’s Alright Editions) are gorgeous — sinuous brush lines and atmospheric washes, translated beautifully into stochastic screens of melancholy ultramarine blue. A haunting fable about intimacy, art, and the ways we periodically outgrow ourselves and each other, it makes me hope that Lee keeps making comics like this in addition to single-panel cartoons. I’m sure Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish will — and certainly deserves to — appear on many of these lists, but I’m going to make a case for I’ve Always Known You!, a Riso zine printed by Travis Head at Virginia Tech. Where Kayla E.’s other comics get a lot of mileage out of the tension between the horrors of the story and the airtight slickness of the drawing and design, I enjoy the way the printing here brings a soft, slightly grubby touch to the presentation. Given her many allusions to classic kids comics, it’s a thrill to see some authentic misregistration, and at a certain level I think a story like this — characteristically concerned with abject abuse and neglect, as well as almost unfathomable pain and the miraculous possibility of its ultimate transcendence — should leave the reader’s hands a little dirty. I’ve already written about how much I love Gary Panter’s issue of Smoke Signal from this year, but I’d also like to shine a light on the very next issue by Tara Booth. While many cartoonists have broken out a paint box now and again, I can’t think of any whose work engages the language of painting — not only color but touch, viscosity, transparency, etc. — in the service of cartooning more successfully than Booth’s does. In this way her forms fully embody her primary theme of the tragicomic indignities of hungry, sweaty corporeality. Like Kayla E., Booth has an ambitious hardcover book out that should find its way onto many best-of lists, but for me the broadsheet format of Smoke Signal provides a more generous canvas for her discomfiting, hilarious, and often strikingly beautiful work. Nick Bunch’s How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes (Cram Books) is a sublimely cynical and enjoyable addiction/recovery memoir. Bunch, like a lot of younger cartoonists, seems to have learned to draw from watching The Point! on YouTube while eating fistfuls of brown acid and caffeine gum — and yes, I’m saying that like it’s a good thing. How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes is manic, breathless, claustrophobic, and compulsively readable. There's a grotesquely funny scene where Bunch’s lymphatic system is wrenched free of his body and subsequently holds a publishing meeting that’s worthy of Burroughs. I had a blast reviewing Mansect for TCJ.com, and two subsequent Smudge titles — Face Meat and especially My Gorilla Family— are also favorites from this year: glorious slabs of vintage Japanese grand-guignol weirdness brought Stateside with tender loving care by translator Ryan Holmberg and publisher/designer Sean Michael Robinson. And finally, the belated appearance of a U.S. collection of Quino’s Mafalda (Elsewhere Editions) — arguably the most important Latin American comic strip in history — is a major event, despite the nearly unforgivable lack of a contextualizing essay or even the years in which the strips were originally published. Speaking of context: if you want to be chilled to the bone, read it while keeping in mind Quino’s answer to a reporter’s question of what Maflada would have been like as a grownup: “Mafalda never would have reached adulthood. She would be among Argentina’s thirty thousand disappeared.” *** (articles) (top) Runaways by Rainbow Rowell, Elena Casagrande, and Roberta Igrata I have a strange and secret soft spot for Marvel’s Runaways, a book which definitely belongs under the "capes" label, but just barely. When the team was first created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona in 2003, the series was hailed as one of the most fascinating titles from Marvel at the time. The team had a wonderful mix of X-Men melodrama, Fantastic Four sci-fi concepts, and a Buffy-esque sense of the teenager. Second only to Vaughan, Runaways is defined by the writing of Rainbow Rowell, who has written runs on the series several times at this point, and likely has more Runaways issues under her belt than Vaughan himself. Rowell brings the same vibrancy essential to this run, which started in June 2025. It spawned from the rather uninteresting "One World Under Doom" event which recently ended to a collective yawn and eye roll, but Runaways exists largely apart from the greater Marvel universe. At its heart the run is a fun, jaunty character piece full of angsty teen witches, psychic velociraptors from the future, and existentialist Doombots. The series, which is coming out in trade in February 2026, is well worth picking up from your local comic shop. New Gods by Ram V and Evan Cagle DC’s New Gods is one of those rare superhero comics that were so incredibly ambitious, strange, and masterful when they were first created by Jack Kirby, that it’s hard to imagine topping its original run ever again. Ram V and Evan Cagle might just have done it. New Gods is one of the best monthly comics to be hitting the shelves of your comic shop. Full. Freaking. Stop. V nails the grand, sweeping tone that makes DC comics so compelling. Paired with Cagle’s intricate, jaw-droppingly beautiful art along with hall-of-famer guest artists such as Travis Moore and Filipe Andrade, the tales of Kirby’s Fourth World come to life once more. If you’re looking for a carbon copy of Kirby’s Fourth World saga, you’re not necessarily going to find it, but many of the really important parts of Kirby’s story are all there. V’s story is all about the grand forces of war and peace, beauty and ugliness sweeping powerful beings up in their path. I’ve always felt that Kirby’s work on the Fourth World contained in it a lot of the sadness of a man who had seen the awful realities of war and lived to tell its gutted tale. That melancholia, that sense of grief for a reality mired in conflict is all there in V’s New Gods, but also there is hope for peace and love that underscores all of Kirby’s New Gods comics. Ram V’s work is often compared to that of the British invasion, and until new gods his notable capes titles, such as his Detective Comics, have been in conversation with that movement. New Gods however, feels like the exact kind of elaboration on Kirby’s work that the King of Comics would have wanted. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodridguez, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou If New Gods is one of the best monthly comics hitting shelves this year, Absolute Martian Manhunter is the best monthly comic of 2025. Combining Deniz Camp’s astounding writing with the auteurship of Javier Rodriguez, Absolute Martian Manhunter recreates its titular character in a way no one but these two wildly talented creators could. Camp, who will appear again later on this list, is one of the best contemporary comic writers working. Absolute Martian Manhunter reimagines one of DC’s strangest and least appreciated Justice Leaguers as a counter-terrorism intelligence agent who begins to be able to visualize, touch, and taste other people’s thoughts and emotions as the world is overcome by a great and terrifying evil: Darkseid. New Gods and Absolute Martian both reimagine Darkseid in ways that put his other modern and contemporary depictions to shame, imagining him as a sublime, unintelligible force of irrational "anti-life." Rodriguez’s art, which blew me away in his Zatanna and Defenders: Beyond has evolved to unimaginable heights. Opening up Absolute Martian to Rodriguez’s colorful depictions of the human consciousness is one of the great joys of comics this year. I would be remiss not to also sing the praises of my favorite letterer of all time Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, who is a frequent partner of Camp, and makes it impossible to ignore the wondrous alchemy of lettering. Ultimate X-Men by Peach Momoko Peach Momoko needs very little introduction to readers interested in the more fringe elements of the superhero comics world. Momoko had a rich background in underground manga before becoming a phenom for her watercolor cover art and her X-Men miniseries Demon Days. Momoko is a true auteur, writing, drawing, and water-coloring her books. When Demon Days first hit the stands I was blown away by both the sheer scale of the project and its striking quality. Like Javier Rodriguez in Absolute Martian, however, Momoko has outdone herself in her newest X-Men book, which reimagines the team as a group of Japanese middle-schoolers who gain powers and are swept up in the battle between good and evil. Like much of the great shonen manga coming out of Japan right now, Ultimate X-Men takes what could have been a pretty cut and dry story concept, and imbues it with an emotional weight and maturity you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a book starring middle-schoolers who get powers. The book revolves around the conflicting forces of grief and isolation, and friendship and connection. Batman Superman World’s Finest by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, and Tamra Bonvillain I’ve praised a lot of DC’s current editorial direction over the last year or two, but their current event, "DC K-O," is one of the most half-assed, lackluster, and generally uninspired attempts at a story I’ve read in a long time. That being said, some of its offshoots, like those of "One World Under Doom" have impressed me. Waid and Mora’s Worlds Finest is one such series. Waid is one of those true industry pros who tends to really get his characters right. He’s worked on excellent runs of Daredevil, Fantastic Four, and Flash to name a few. When I say World’ s Finest may be the Mark Waid comic I am most impressed by, it really means something to me. He’s doing God’s work in combatting the kind of punch-em-up driven idiocy that is at the foundation of K-O, choosing instead to write a rare character portrait of the two most legendary superheroes of all time. The book is driven, fundamentally, by the friendship between its two titular heroes, along with their love for their various Bat- and Superfamilies. Mora’s art has the dynamism of Jorge Jimenez mixed with Chris Samnee, and it’s hard not to find a smile plastered across your face looking at the candy-colored blurs of Superman and Batman flying across the page. Plus it’s got some really excellent banter between Supes and Bats, which I really can’t get enough of. Batman by Matt Fraction and Jorge Jimenez After a bit of a mixed bag run on the title by Chip Zdarsky, fellow comics powerhouse Matt Fraction took on the Batman mantle with Jorge Jimenez, who was also a standout artist on Zdarsky’s own run. Jimenez and Fraction’s first four issues on Batman may become a generationally excellent run akin to Grant Morrison’s time on the title. Jimenez’s layouts are filmic, conveying action with a cool dynamism that a character like Batman just needs for a good run. Fraction also brings all the best parts of Zdarsky’s run into his own, focusing on a Bat family unified by love and support, rather than the typical catty strife that lazier writers return to over and over again. Supergirl by Sophie Campbell and Tamra Bonvillain Sophie Campbell’s Supergirl is one of the most enjoyable DC comics coming out right now. It’s heartening to see a female superhero book written and colored by two trans women, and edited by an all-woman team, especially after the Red Hood debacle. Campbell brings a refreshing messy goofiness to Supergirl that I found immediately satisfying. Campbell clearly cares a lot about the characters she’s writing, bringing a great deal of respect to every page without taking herself or the series too seriously. Each issue is emotionally compelling but also downright hilarious, with this month’s issue being a touching and rather horrifying holiday special about abandonment and trauma. Ultimate Spider-Man by Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checcheto, and David Messina Jonathan Hickman. The name rings with a kind of super-hero sanctity. Hickman became famous for his work on operatic Marvel stories like House of X/Powers of X, Secret Wars, and his runs on Avengers and Fantastic Four. These stories are spoken of in reverent tones by comics nerds. They’ve become the standard by which all other superhero events are judged, and very few events measure up. That’s why it was so shocking to find that Hickman was writing a single-character book on Ultimate Spider-Man. The premise of this book is simple: what if Peter Parker became Spider-Man as a forty year old husband to Mary Jane and a father of two? The answer is a sweet, funny, and beautiful story far more about family and community than it is about loneliness. I think of Ultimate Spider-Man as a portrait of what our superhero comics would look like if we ever allowed them to break free of the horrifying chronal stasis they are trapped in. Hickman’s Peter Parker is a character who evolves and matures, is allowed to love and laugh and grieve. I hope the series is indicative of the direction Hickman wants to take his future work. The art in these issues really shines as well, with some of the best inking from Checcetto and Messina as well as the best non-Momoko coloring from Matt Wilson. Black Cohosh by Eagle Valiant Brosi Black Cohosh is one of the most fascinating books I’ve read this year. Brosi’s work is an experimental tour de force in this novel. Ignoring the confines of the panel and perspective, his art grows out of the page with the free wildness of an untamed wood or a child’s mind. Black Cohosh is a tough read, as most books about painful childhoods are. The autofictional memoir follows Eagle as he grows up in an alternative living commune in Appalachia. His speech impediment makes him a target for child and adult bullies alike, and his only nurturing relationship is with his mother, who takes him out into the woods to hunt for plants and herbs. I would liken this book to Jeannette Walls’s seminal memoir The Glass Castle, which details her nomadic childhood brought up by similarly eccentric and neglectful parents. Black Cohosh is narratively and aesthetically virtuosic and I would not hesitate to say that, if you are looking for something akin to an American avant-garde in comics and literature, Eagle Valiant Brosi is a card-carrying member. Cannon by Lee Lai Lee Lai is the cartoonist who came closest to making me cry this year. Lee is one of the most important contemporary queer artists of our time. The book is a whirlwind of queer love, rage, friendship, and loneliness. Cannon follows the harrowing friendship of Cannon and Trish as they navigate the trials and travails of an aging friendship between adults. Cannon is a book that could only exist as a comic, melding the interior worlds of its characters with the external one, creating a novel which hovers somewhere between magical realism and gut-wrenching novel. Assorted Crisis Events by Deniz Camp, Eric Zawadzki, Jordie Bellaire, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou As foreshadowed, Deniz Camp appears twice on this list. Assorted Crisis Events is probably the most formally interesting work on this list, aside from, perhaps, Black Cohosh. The central question of this science fiction anthology masterpiece is "what if all the strange things that happen in a capes crisis even were happening to normal people all over the place?" In each issue, of which there are now seven, we follow a new protagonist as they are plunged into one of these crisis events; in one issue, a woman grapples with PTSD after she was forced to relive the same sixty seconds over and over again millions of times; in another, a woman must care for her husband who wakes up as a child with no memories of her one day, and as an old man the next. Camp’s work on Assorted Crisis Events feels very much in line with the formal experimentation of the great British Invasion writers and artists, who took it upon themselves to combine their narrative prowess with the untapped potential of comics as a medium. Like the great books of the Vertigo era, Assorted Crisis Events is the brilliant product of Camp, Zawadzki, Bellaire, and my beloved Otsmane-Elhaou, who come together in this book to make something greater than the sum of its parts. I should warn that this book is not for the faint of heart. Its vision of the future is apocalyptic, rarely, if ever cathartic, and all almost always heart-breaking. Adventure Time: The Bubbline College Special by Caroline Cash Caroline Cash’s Marceline and Princess Bubblegum lesbian love story one-shot for Oni Press’ newly revived Adventure Time comics is a real light in the darkness of this year. Written, drawn, colored, and lettered by Cash, the issue is in its third printing, and for good reason. Cash is doing what she does best: making hilarious and adorable lesbian rom-com comics. There’s a bit of her Peepeepoopoo comics in the one-shot, but really this is a book for young gay kids who are either discovering themselves or are in desperate need of self-representation. It’s a wonderful primer into the world of gay love stories in much the same way that the original Adventure Time was for a whole generation of kids. I’ve already bought two printings of the Bubbline College Special, and I’m contemplating getting a third, it’s that fun. Adventure Time by Nick Winn and Derek M. Ballard I’ve reviewed Winn and Ballard’s Adventure Time comics twice for Fanbase Press, at this point, and I could do it several more times without losing steam. I was an avid reader of the original comics from the 2010s, and these are very much in line with those weird little comics masterpieces. There’s a sense of freewheeling whimsy in these pages that reminds you of the importance of play and wonder not just in comics but life. If you’re a stickler about adaptations, and I certainly am about Adventure Time at least, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by what Winn is doing in his main stories, as well as Ballard’s back-up mini comics. They preserve the sense of the original cartoon and the old comics adaptation. *** (articles) (top) There's one in every comics library – that irresistible, untranslatable foreign masterpiece. You deploy DeepL and Google, but they surrender, unable to make sense of its distinctive dialogue. The gorgeous illustrations pull you back in anyway, inviting you to search each panel for clues. Yet even without understanding a word, this is a volume you pull out often, sharing it with friends, and dipping in at unexpected moments, like a favorite book of poems. Now, Fumiko Takano's slim, gorgeous Miss Ruki is finally available in English, deftly translated by Alexa Frank. This sweet, singular volume, praised by manga stars from Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) to Keigo Shinzō (Tokyo Alien Bros.), is one of my books of the year. Miss Ruki is 58 kaleidoscopic views of friendship. Two small-town girls, meeting again as adults under the bright lights of Tokyo, try for a bond which eluded them in childhood. With each snapshot of their grown-up lives, Takano is manga's Cartier-Bresson, capturing life's decisive moments with laughter and surprise. Her pen lavishes attention on the least utensil, bicycle basket, and library book, while bringing each shop clerk as fully to life as her two main characters. This is how Takano sees, how Ruki sees and, by the end of this lovely book, how we do as well. Perhaps that's the biggest gift of this delightful collection, granting us a sixth sense – of humor. After reading this book, Takano's unique take on life's fads and foibles stays with you, revealing Miss Ruki moments everywhere you turn. *** (articles) (top) Crimehot, Alec Robbins, Silver Sprocket Rly good. Valley Valley/Idella Dell, Audra Stang, Frog Farm Audra Stang cartoons with such emotional audacity that the weak will doubt there’s any effort to it. Miss Ruki, Fumiko Takano, New York Review Books Charming and delightful strips, beautifully drawn, which, considered in sum and with the context of Alexa Frank’s excellent translator’s essay at the end, portray how economics impact the use that normative social systems have for difference. When money is good, a friendly weirdo can be someone whose choices simply don’t align with the mainstream but whose presence affirms that mainstream as a site of choice for those within it. “They” can flourish well enough in warm juxtaposition. When money is bad, the Other is no longer tolerable because their different value set has been vindicated — they become an unwanted example to normal, formerly-successful, people suffering a loss of security. My hope is that people reading Miss Ruki will see the folly, or at least the cruelty, in that kind of reactionary exclusion. A secondary recommendation — Miss Ruki as an asexual equivalent to Pusztai’s Jucika! Light-hearted, responsive capers, once again offering affirmation through difference in conviction. She and Jucika would be penpals, I think. Mal Maywood’s Cliff & Father Eugene, Instagram This is not a finished comic, or a three-block narrative. Cliff & Father Eugene exist on Maywood’s instagram and Patreon, and on Tapas; very short episodes, moments captured. It’s the warmth, though—there’s such a gentle, dogeared masculinity present, like a leather wingback rubbed to a shine — it’s the tenderness of rendering and narrative choice combined with fridge-like solidity in build that reminds me of men from storybooks I read as a child. Gabrielle Vincent’s Ernest, or Raymond Briggs’ comfortable, cheeky adults: the worn-in, tired loveliness cues you that this combination of young gay parishioner and old gay priest is supposition rather than argument — what if everything could be alright? Well. What if? World Within the World, Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics As mentioned, alchemically firming. The Perfect Mistake, Yev Yanko, Instagram Also not a finished work to any degree, also available mainly via Instagram, The Perfect Mistake perfectly represents the comics I want to be reading every day, casually, easily: psychologically-driven horny bad-person romance, drawn deliciously with verve and dashing conviction and texture. If you like Baldur’s Gate, Yanko has additional content you may enjoy. The Stone Cold General & the Maid Perplexed by his Burning Passion, Iruka Bando & Youka Koinada, MangaPlaza Beautiful, refined, operatic lifework with real commitment to character and costume design, over a framework of straight-faced yet devious world building and narrative design. It’s great and in my opinion socially healthy to see straight-laced, kind, thoughtful and serious characters give each other emergency handjobs without this being dismissed as either a gag or emotionally inconsequential. Plus-Sized Misadventures in Love, mamakari, MangaPlaza Cute and funny and DEMANDING. If you find yourself troubled by the returning onslaught of thinspo, take shelter here. What if I Feel Pretty was good? Like really good. Show It To Me Baby!, Keiko Hagiwara, MangaPlaza MangaPlaza hosts a plethora of “adult romance” comics, which means sex-forward visuals and very involved sound effects — amongst them are some of strong narrative quality. Show It To Me, Baby! is an example which pursues the tentative, creeping, insecure and self-sabotaging internal yearn of career-women’s-problems romance classics like You’re My Pet without assuming that the directly sexual must come later in the story. *** (articles) (top) Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) I read a few Gilbert Hernandez graphic novels I’d previously skipped this year — Marble Season, Bumperhead, Love From The Shadows -—and while they were all great, Life Drawing reaffirmed why Jaime is my guy. The culmination of plot threads begun in Tonta and Is This How You See Me, Life Drawing splits its focus intergenerationally, attending to both the aging members of the established cast and the fresh-faced youth introduced more recently. The tone feels wistful and melancholic in its sense of retrospect but also captures what it’s like to experience feelings for the first time, the combo stirring up depths of emotion constantly, even when it reads like Archie comics shenanigans, making for a reading experience that feels as profound as life itself. Misery Of Love, Yvan Alagbe (New York Review Comics) I bought a French edition of this a few years back, assuming it would never be translated, as the depictions of explicit sex that made such an immediate impression on a flip-through suggested a nonstarter for the book trade, and that each such image was a beautiful painting made it function as an art book even if the narrative were abstracted to me. Now that I can read Donald Nicholson-Smith’s translation, instead of my tentative fumblings with Google Translate, I can begin to suss out exactly how many feelings are contained within the bodies and expressions Alagbe renders so gorgeously. A reread of Alagbe’s Yellow Negroes helps to contextualize these passions within a more linear framework, but as much as I like that book’s stark black and white, the painterly washes of Misery Of Love are more appealing, while the story they suggest is shiftier, providing more to return to. (I should shout out NYRC’s collection of the works of Michael McMillan, Terminal Exposure, which is just really cool — his career begins with comics that serve as the historical connective tissue between the underground’s Kim Deitch and the later generation of Mark Beyer and Richard Sala, and then moves on from there to something that engages the undergrounds’ nostalgia for the visual culture of yesteryear to more personal-poetic ends than his peers.) Key Change, Miles MacDiarmid (self-published) There are cartoonists who do alright for themselves making comics about bad interactions with strangers at bars, or awkward interactions with roommates, but Miles MacDiarmid is unparalleled in his ability to write such scenes with a degree of specificity and comedic timing, so that readers understand what is charged about each scenario, while others coast on a reader’s sense of identification with a protagonist to say, “Ha ha, you get it,” before a joke is even attempted. You could call this “sitcom comics,” but MacDiarmid’s control of the page is closer to filmic than televisual: See the economy at which the first two pages of Key Change establish the premise and contextualize and explain the front cover, before we even get to the sequences of dialogue that escalate tension as the story goes on. MacDiarmid was a member of the Freak collective of comics-makers, and I must also mention issue 8 of Shaheen Beardsley’s Oboy, a series whose first six issues were collected alongside MacDiarmid’s The Hive: Coronation by Freak a few years ago. If most of the efforts of the younger generation of baffle and depress you, these are the sort of funny and well-drawn comics that will keep your enthusiasm for the medium going. Absolute Martian Manhunter, Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez (DC Comics) Credit editor-in-chief Marie Javins, because after years of mainstream comics being the worst they’ve ever been, DC has resumed putting out comics people actually want to read, with the Absolute line generating comic shop chatter. Even if you enjoyed issues of Al Ewing and Steve Lieber’s Metamorpho revival, it’s not hard to see why the Absolute line would connect with a larger, younger audience by abstaining from DC’s typical nostalgia for the 1960s. At least the sixties as manifested in silver age comics: Javier Rodriguez constructs a cartooning language in Absolute Martian Manhunter that employs the skill he’s honed as a colorist, designing his work for color to make for particularly bold, flowing page layouts that speak the argot of silkscreened psychedelic poster design in a way that can communicate to readers weaned on manga’s black and white pages. Deniz Camp provides the artist with a script to work with that’s not YA-brained garbage; characters move through these layouts with purpose and rhythm, telling a story with more on its mind than just IP rejuvenation. I’m taking one page’s description of a nuclear bomb screaming as a reference to Gravity’s Rainbow, while a plot point involving cookie poisoning seems to refer to both David Foster Wallace’s story “Mister Squishy” and how for decades the most famous bit of Martian Manhunter’s characterization was that Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis made him like eating Oreos. It’s hard for me to resist this combination of formalist cartooning brio and a sense of having read actual books, and it’s rare that it even comes up. Tongues Volume One, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) With congratulations comes a concomitant casting of blame: I suspect Absolute Wonder Woman, with its combination of strong drawing, elaborate layouts, and recasting of mythology, overshadowed Anders Nilsen’s Tongues, which did similar things, and I thought was certain to crossover to a mainstream fantasy-inclined audience. Tongues has a stately pace, years in the making, which Absolute Wonder Woman trades for the fast-moving continual escalation assembly-line-produced comics can afford, boosted in the attention economy by the presence of a beloved corporate trademark, coming off like the American remake compared to Nilsen’s European art film. Tongues is the greater accomplishment, simmering as the reader sinks into it, moving between plot threads it slowly braids together. Unfortunately, the 360-page Volume One feels like it just stops, rather than reaching an ending, with the climax and conclusion forthcoming in book two. While I’ll be there for the second collection of Absolute Wonder Woman when it’s out in February, (as well as checking out the collection of artist Hayden Sherman’s work on Batman: Dark Patterns), I’ll also be anticipating Tongues’ conclusion, likely to appear a decade from now, which indicates a staying power few artists can be bothered to be imbue their work with, in these days where the ambitions of art are flattened by the demand for content above all. *** (articles) (top) Girls Gone Wild #1 by Katie Lane (2d Cloud): Katie Lane’s comic has two sections; however, the Girls Gone Wild story has stayed with me more than any other comic I have read this year. Lane’s line feels drawn from life, as she collages moments into one. Lane’s dense, scratchy lettering is complemented by drawings that fill the page and capture perspectives in the quiet moments of conversations. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram): Big Gamble Rainbow Highway is filled with paranoid compact pages; each panel builds anxiety and paranoia. Myer’s ink-only line is expressive and fluid. The moments that break open and Myers’ drawing chops break out of the page’s confines are what made this one of my favorite comics of 2025. Key Change by Miles MacDiarmid (Self-Published): Key Change scratched an itch for me this year. I was a fan of MacDiarmid’s Hive from a few years back and was very excited about another venture into his character's world. Characters that MacDiarmid can make endearing and engaging within a page of their appearance. MacDiarmid’s ear for the interpersonal is translated into one of the most entertaining and funny reads of the year. Leone in “Blood from the Stone” and Other Stories by Max Burlingame (Cram): This year, I became obsessed with Max Burlingame’s mark-making. It would be easy to get lost in the hatching and patterns of any given panel if the story didn’t also propel the reader through its blood-obsessed world. Shout out to Cram for the excellent presentation of Burlingame’s work. *** (articles) (top) "I don’t even know if I like comics anymore," narrates Tara Booth at the start of her contribution to issue #54 of kuš!’s š! anthology. This year has been, as ever, an interesting one — between unrelated personal malaises and various industrial impediments (the final downfall of Diamond, for one), my reading has slowed down somewhat substantially. But now here I am, reminding myself that there is, in fact, some beauty left in the world of comics. And what better way to start than with — you guessed it — š! #54. I’m always quite fond of the guest-edited issues, and in this instance guest co-editor Caroline Cash delivers a strong showing, balancing kuš! favorites with a nice bit of shock to the Baltic system; of the latter category, Emma Hunsinger’s lesbian fantasy-drama and Leo Fox’s almost-Nabokovian narratorial play certainly stand out. Elsewhere, though I typically don’t tend to sort by publishers in these write-ups, New York Review Comics continue to be perhaps the single most vital curatorial line we have in our little Anglosphere. Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé is one of the most moving instances of form-following-function that I’ve encountered yet, while Miss Ruki is just about the platonic ideal of a crowd pleaser that still manages to please; Michael McMillan’s Terminal Exposure, meanwhile, subverts the common taboo-busting narrative of first-generation underground comix by looking outwards, both artistically and physically, for inspiration. (A special mention likewise goes to The Complete C Comics, which is a beautiful achievement of archiving in itself but which I have yet to read in its entirety; ditto Dash Shaw and R. Kikuo Johnson’s collection of Rea Irvin’s The Smythes, which I was hoping to read by the time of this write-up, but, alas, life gets in the way.) Outside of NYRC, too, we got two quite monumental reprint releases courtesy of Fantagraphics: World within the World is the long-overdue Julia Gfrörer shorts collection we’ve all been jonesing for (all of us with taste, anyway), while the archival Night Drive by Richard Sala serves as a beautiful road-map to the late great cartoonist’s restless career. The return of Anders Nilsen with the first collected volume of Tongues (Pantheon) and the first book of Linnea Sterte’s A Garden of Spheres (Peow2) proved a surprising complement, both of them focusing, through a genre-inflected lens, on that apocalyptic storm looming on the horizon and the beings charged, for better or worse, with bringing it forth. For Nilsen, this comes with some surprising divergences from his usual form (full coloring, for one; a much heavier narrative bent, for another); in Sterte’s book (which, in the interest of full disclosure, I had the pleasure of proofreading part of, for its self-published serialization), the cartoonist appears fully in her wheelhouse, with a charmingly-languorous approach to world-building in the vein of Angélica Gorodischer. Elsewhere, Michael DeForge (keep an eye out for my interview with him sometime in the new year) and Kayla E. both used life experience as a launchpad. For DeForge, the launchpad is a narrative one, as Holy Lacrimony (Drawn & Quarterly) draws — in part, and irreducibly—on DeForge’s own struggles to further that thematic fixture, the authenticity of human connection; Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish (Fantagraphics), meanwhile, draws on comics history as a mechanism of aesthetic detachment (and emotional repression) in a frenzy to clean that which cannot be cleansed. The first issue of Joe Walsh’s The Shifting Ground (self-published) offered a similar aesthetically-driven take on autobio, marrying the textural directness of Frank Santoro with the cogitative digressions of Kevin Huizenga, while Nick Bunch’s How to Stop Smoking Cigarettes (Cram) saw Bunch venture ever deeper into textural frenetics while still maintaining a beautifully vivid and immediately-intuitive grasp on flow and legibility. In what must, for want of a better term, be termed “literary fiction,” two more of comics’ finest observers of human interaction returned this year: Lee Lai’s second long-form outing, Cannon (Drawn & Quarterly) is a mental spiral in the truest sense of the term, running in all directions with painful clarity; Carol Swain’s three-piece revue Another Way Out (Dark and Golden) takes a more sedate approach, forcing its readers to do their own mental and inferential calculus. And what of the future? This year saw the release of three striking books by cartoonists entirely new to me: Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy (Drawn & Quarterly) merges a distinct strain of the D&Q lineage, from Seth to DeForge, with ruminations on the intersection of political and personal; Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles) offers up some beautiful anti-adventure stories; and Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram) packs both an emotional rattle and a graphic one. Maybe I do like comics, narrates Tara Booth at the end of her š! #54 contribution. Ain’t that just the way. Until next year … *** (articles) (top) For someone whose one and only lasting dream job is writing a workplace sitcom starring members of the circa-1987 Defenders, I fell off superhero comics hard in 2024. I've drifted away from the genre for years, mostly on account of basic growing up, but this year, absolutely nothing clicked. Friends and colleagues insist that a lot of quality cape books came out in the last year, and I'm sure they're right; in fact, you can probably read all about them in this very article. But the few times I tried, I just couldn't stick with it. Maybe the whole idea of reading about imaginary heroism when we live in a time of such complete lack of courage leaves me flat. Maybe I'm just being old. Regardless, it wasn't hard to pick ten great ones from a year where culture so often failed us. I struggle to find a common theme: In many ways, it found me looking back at the great creators of the last few decades, but maybe that's simple nostalgia. But maybe it's also thinking of one's self as increasingly part of the past, as the future becomes something that feels all used up. A thread of something ending, even to just transform into something else with or without you, runs through it, of history as a nightmare from which we are forever haunted. These are ten I won't easily forget. Insectopolis: A Natural History, Peter Kuper (W.W. Norton & Company) The insect apocalypse has been much on my mind this year, and I'm not alone. In his latest, Peter Kuper asks: What if it already happened? What if the insects studied us the way we once studied them? And what if ... it really wasn't all that bad, after all? Kuper's wild, whimsical history of the relationship between man and bug is informative, entertaining, expertly constructed, funny, tragic, and addictive, everything a comic by a real pro should be. Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) It is often a conflict when praising the work of an established talent in the comics world: Are you praising them because of excellence or because of familiarity? Luckily for all of us, Jaime Hernandez leaves no space between them: these stories, with seemingly only the thread of the complicated dynamic between Tonta and Maggie between them, ultimately cohere with a shimmering unity that matches his tremendous draftsmanship, seemingly getting better every year, to a tee. The Mongoose, Joana Mosi (Pow Pow Press) One of the best meditations on grief that I've read in a decade, The Mongoose, with its deceptively simple black-and-white line art and its expanses of silence, reminded me of nothing on first encounter as much as the late Chantal Akerman's masterful Jeanne Dielman. Only the presence of a playful, ominous, and possibly imaginary mongoose keeps its head above the clouds, but the combination is transcendent: sad, funny, smart, meaningful, and with quiet, stunning emotional power. More Weight: A Salem Story, Ben Wickey (Top Shelf Productions) At times like this, when it's easy to believe this country was doomed from the start, it's almost trite to praise a book that so convincingly makes that very argument, hitting a large and prominent nail right on the head with the story of a group of puritanical fanatics that start looking for a special scapegoat. Wickey's canny art, the elegance of which skates right up to the edge of the grotesque, makes More Weight the complete package, the most successful combination of art and story of the year. Muybridge, Guy Delisle [Helga Dascher & Rob Aspinall, translators] (Drawn & Quarterly) Artists in every medium have been drawn to retell the story of Eadweard Muybridge. And why not? He practically invented the modern conception of a moving picture, and it's no surprise that someone as curious and capable as Guy Delisle would want to take another crack at him. Muybridge's life was almost too eventful to comprehend, but Delisle draws the heart of the man and his work out at just the right moments, his clean and expressive lines providing perfect framing for his subject's genius. Nocturnos, Laura Pérez, translated by Andrea Rosenberg (Fantagraphics) The most powerful and effective treatment of the menacing nature of nighttime since Roger Ekirch's At Day's Close, Pérez's new graphic novel establishes that the dark hours are just as full of mystery as they ever were. With nebulous art that throbs with the same eerie energy that infuse the stories, it's a series of vignettes that have the same incomprehensible logic of an inescapable dream. The use of color may be the most effective of any book I read in 2025. The Once and Future Riot, Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Joe Sacco has been on an absolutely Olympian tear of late. More productive than he's ever been, he's also honed his visuals to a razor's edge, and the clarity and the insightfulness of his approach has proven itself crucial to the moment. This gorgeously limned account of the Uttar Pradesh riots in India over a decade ago, it reverberates into the present with undeniable demands about the nature of violence, how we know what we know, and the bloody ways in which those things connect. The Past is a Grotesque Animal, Tommi Parrish (Fantagraphics) The tumbling, ranging nature of Tommi Parrish's sumptuous work about identity, relationships, sexuality, and just about everything else under the sun wouldn't shine the way it does without its exquisite visuals, with their vibrant shifting painted surfaces, but it doesn't have to. The combination leaves us with a shockingly intimate creation, like walking through a stranger's house and learning more about them in every room. A vital piece of trans art at a time it is desperately needed. Salt Green Death, Katarina Thorsen (Conundrum Press) A historical reconstruction, an intricate mystery, and an investigation of the way we are harmed and helped by the people meant to have care of us, Thorsen's book — composed of masterful waves of shifting colored pencils that fit its historical period magnificently — tells the story of a disturbed man named Joseph O'Dwyer's life-altering encounters with the psychiatric system of Canada in the postwar years. It's a tremendous piece of work, making a small story resonate into much greater meaning. Tongues, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon Books) When I first encountered Anders Nilsen's riveting retelling of the myth of Prometheus, brought squalling into Afghanistan in the 21st century, I thought it was instantly one of the most memorable things I'd seen in a long while. Time and repeat reading has not disabused me of that belief. There is unexpected depth in the portrayal of its archetypical characters, and its honeycomb structures mirror each other and reflect its themes of language and history with precision and intricacy. HONORABLE MENTION Black Cohosh, Eagle Valiant Brosi (Drawn & Quarterly) Calavera, P.I., Marco Finnegan (Oni Press) Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) Drome, Jesse Lonergan (23rd St.) Gaza in My Phone, Mazen Kerbaj (OR Books) The Giant: Orson Welles, the Artist and the Shadow, Youssef Daoudi (23rd St.) Holy Lacrimony, Michael DeForge (Drawn & Quarterly) In the End We All Die, Tobias Aeschbacher [Andrew Shields, translator] (Helvetiq) John Muir: To the Heart of Solitude, Lomig (NBM Publishing) Lovers and Haters, Gilbert Hernandez (Fantagraphics) The Magnificent Adventure, Milo Manara (Fantagraphics) The Murder Next Door: A Graphic Memoir, Hugh D'Andrade (Street Noise Books) The Pit, Erik Kriek (Living the Line) Simplicity: A Novel, Mattie Lubchansky (Pantheon Books) World within the World: The Collected Short Comix 2010-2022, Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2024 was a terrific year for the medium, with new releases by greats like Olivier Schrauwen, Rick Altergott, Maurice Vellekoop, Emil Ferris, Peter Bagge, Dash Shaw, and many others (not to mention a bumper crop of books by Charles Burns). Could this year possibly live up to it? Well, pretty much. Although some long-awaited projects (like Jay Stephens’ Figgy Furthermore and the fifth volume of D&Q’s Yoshiharu Tsuge series) got pushed back to 2026, there was more than enough to make up for it. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed everything listed below, and could have included many more if time (and space) allowed. So, in no particular order … Tongues, Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) Surely this will be on many people’s lists. Superbly written, beautifully illustrated, and charged with a lightning crackle of dry humor, this bold reimagining of the story of Prometheus weaves three separate narratives into a complex (and timely) meditation on the present state of humanity. Nilsen’s most ambitious project yet, its visual inventiveness never lets up for a second, every page bursting with ideas that can sometimes barely be contained, but which never seem superfluous. To say it’s the work of a Promethean talent would just be too obvious. But I’ve done it now, so what the hell. World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) From a distance, this beautifully presented volume looks like some long-forgotten collection of obscure fairy tales. The scary kind. And that seems appropriate, as some pretty horrible things happen within its pages. But no matter how grim they get, it’s impossible to look away from these utterly compelling tales of human misery, which are infused with a dark eroticism and flashes of pitch-black humor. Although recalling at times the work of Eddie Campbell, Tony Millionaire, or early Chester Brown, Gfrörer’s work remains utterly unique, the product of a fiercely intelligent cartoonist who isn’t afraid to stare into the abyss. Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) One of the best reissues of the year. Fantagraphics did an exemplary job resurrecting this early gem by the late Richard Sala (all but impossible to find in its original form), expanding the original self-published comic into a handsome hardcover designed by Daniel Clowes and rounding it out with a lengthy introduction and several previously unpublished pages. A delightfully eccentric mélange of gothic noir, Universal monster films, and the surreal serial epics of Louis Feuillade, it had everything you could want from this irreplaceable master of the macabre. The Weight by Melissa Mendes (Drawn & Quarterly) Ten years in the making, it was wonderful to see this sprawling coming-of-age tale finally published in a single volume. Loosely based on a memoir written by her grandfather, Mendes has crafted a brutal, but deeply moving and occasionally uplifting story that delves deep into the messy, confusing business of being alive. Epic in scope, but intimate in design, the whole book is a masterclass in cartooning. Deftly paced and using minimal dialogue, Mendes relies on subtle shifts in facial expression and body language to communicate a whole range of emotions, while layers of ink wash bring a richness of depth and texture to the everyday details of mid-century rural America that drip from every page. Another Way Out by Carol Swain (Dark & Golden Books) After more than a decade of silence, the prospect of any new material from Carol Swain had begun to seem very distant indeed, so the sudden appearance of this comic from UK-based Dark & Golden Books came as a welcome surprise. Featuring two previously unpublished stories and an extract from a forthcoming graphic novel (more good news!), it was a perfect showcase for her atmospheric pencil and charcoal drawings, and dreamlike, mysterious tales which seem both eerily familiar and one step removed from the world we know. It was like she’d never been away. Beat It, Rufus by Noah Van Sciver (Fantagraphics) One of the most prolific cartoonists working right now, it seems almost surprising that Noah Van Sciver has only released one new book this year. But that one was an absolute treat. Mining similar territory to his beloved Fante Bukowski series, this tale of a washed-up musician who heads out on a desperate, drug-fueled road trip was another perfectly observed study of the delusional but ever-optimistic losers in which he’s specialized for more than a decade. Very funny and oddly moving, it’s a paean to those people who, for better or worse, just can’t stop dreaming. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) You’d think enough had been written about the Mitford sisters over the years, but this captivating book somehow managed to make the story of Nancy, Diana, Unity, et al. seem fresh again. It helped that it wasn’t just a straight biography, but a beautifully designed and exquisitely drawn account of the spell these eccentric and quintessentially English characters cast over Pond when she was a young girl growing up in Southern California. Without letting up for a second, she combines their individual stories into a single dizzying narrative, told with a kind of dry humor that would have made its subjects proud. Tedward (Fantagraphics) and Pleasure Beach #1 (Self-Published) by Josh Pettinger It’s been a good year for Pettinger, with a complete collection of everybody’s favorite “Old Fashioned Guy” hitting the shelves alongside the first issue of what looks like being his most ambitious series yet. Both blend moments of laugh-out-loud humor with nightmarish undercurrents that give them a real emotional weight. The first issue of Pleasure Beach reads like an anxiety-ridden fever dream about returning to the place you grew up. But with several different plot strands already up in the air, we can only wait and see where the story might be going. War Epic #3 by Nathan Cowdry (Self-Published) Cowdry apparently had a hard time completing this third installment of his self-described "epic," which might not bode well for its future. But we can only hope that he finds a way of moving forward, as this tale of a Nazi camp commandant attempting to mount a production of Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard with his unfortunate prisoners is one of the funniest, weirdest books out there at the moment. Although wrong on so many levels, it never feels like Cowdry is just doing this for the shock value, and it’s been a real pleasure watching his already considerable talents improve from issue to issue. My Name is Shingo, Volumes 4&5 by Kazuo Umezz (Viz) Volumes 4 and 5 of this ongoing series take Umezz’s weirdly prescient tale of artificial intelligence gone wrong (through no real fault of its own) into increasingly bizarre and unhinged territory. What began as a seemingly innocent tale of young love has gradually shifted into a delirious meditation on humanity’s relationship with technology. By the end of volume 5, things are beginning to crack at the seams, the story operating at a frenzied pitch several notches above anything that could reasonably be described as rational (and no, that isn’t meant as a criticism). Volume 6 will be the last in the series, but how this will end is anybody’s guess. Being Alive by Simon Hanselmann (Instagram) After the disappointing news that Hanselmann’s zombie epic, You Will Own Nothing And You Will Be Happy, is on indefinite hiatus, Megg & Mogg fans were rewarded this summer with an unexpected treat. Serialized on Instagram à la 2020’s Crisis Zone, this was a rollercoaster ride of weird clown sex and unsanitary car-toilets, flowing with exemplary comic timing and packed with hilarious one-liners. It began by introducing unforgettable characters like Butts Farto and Potatoes O’Brien, and clmaxed with the most inappropriate birthday party you could ever hold for a 9-year-old, where one of the principal cast members was forced to give himself a long, hard look. The blend of outrageous humor and genuine pathos gave the ending an unexpected poignancy that made it feel like an instant classic. A print version should be on the way soon. The Smythes by Rea Irvin (NYRC) Perfectly timed to coincide with The New Yorker’s 100th anniversary, that venerable magazine’s first art editor is honored with a beautifully presented collection of his little-known 1930s newspaper strip. At first glance a sort of elegant cross between Frank King and Crockett Johnson (although a bit too early for the latter, I know), a closer look reveals something entirely his own. The Smythes was a light-hearted satire of social pretension with a refined, Art Deco aesthetic that stood apart from many of his more boisterous contemporaries, and this is a wonderful introduction, ably curated by Dash Shaw, R. Kikuo Johnson, and Caitlin McGurk. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life by Dan Nadel (Scribner) Of course, this isn’t a comic as such, but it has to be included anyway. An in-depth biography of the father of Underground Comix was long overdue, and Nadel unquestionably did the project justice, producing a well-researched and critically astute study that delved deep into Crumb’s work and background, exploring the personal, political, and social realities that shaped his monumental oeuvre. Packed with fascinating details (Leonard Cohen almost wrote the introduction to Head Comix!?), and not afraid to take its subject to task when necessary, it will surely stand as the definitive account for many years to come. And if time allowed… Goes Like This by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics), Crickets #9 by Sammy Harkham (Self-Published), Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith (Abrams), Red Night and Light of the Moon & Other Stories by Hanawa Kazuichi (Breakdown Press/Mansion Press), Holy Lacrimony by Michael DeForge (D&Q), Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, Lorenzo Mattotti & David Mazzucchelli (Pantheon), Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (D&Q), Barnaby, Volume 5 by Crockett Johnson (Fantagraphics), The Art of Milt Gross, Volume 1 by Paul C. Tumey (Erratic Press), The Cabbie, Vols. 1&2 by Marti (Fantagraphics), The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books), Alienation: Final Cut by Inés Estrada (Floating World), Brain Damage by Shintaro Kago (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a hell of a time. The year in which America descended into a fascist government also turned out to be the strongest year for comics in recent memory, and certainly in the time I’ve been writing about them. Who knows: maybe that old canard about bad times producing good art might have something to it after all. In any case, a brief listing of some of the year’s superlatives: Most Cascading Dominos Due to an Industry Bankruptcy: Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. Seediest Self-Immolation of a Longstanding Comics Institution: Angoulême Comics Festival Best Republication of a Near-Forgotten Manga Classic: Drawn and Quarterly’s new collection of Shirato Sanpei’s The Legend of Kamui Most Predictable Aborted Retirement From Superhero Comics: Grant Morrison Most Alarming Looming Possibility for Corporate Interference: David and Larry Ellison’s bid to purchase DC Comics owner Warner Bros. Discovery. Five Best Books of 2025 The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco. Sacco’s latest (and supposedly last, for a time) work of journalistic cartooning is also his best since 1996’s Palestine. It’s also an unexpectedly relevant, if not to say prophetic, commentary on the nature of violence and democracy in action. My pick for the best book of the year. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond. Speaking of unexpectedly relevant commentaries on fascist eras. Mimi Pond’s vibrant, funny biography of the celebrated British sisters is more joyous and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pond has been working for decades, mostly under the radar, but if this is the book that finally makes hers a name to reckon with it will be well-earned. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore. Passmore’s passionate, unflinching look at a century of revolutionary defiance against racial oppression is often grim but never bleak: its underlying theme is one of hope, and a confidence that silence is the one thing no amount of tyranny or apartheid can ever fully achieve. Boy, I do seem to be going heavy on the historical nonfiction this year, don’t I? Maybe it’s the tenor of the times. Better liven things up with something fanciful. Batman and Robin: Year One by Mark Waid and Chris Samnee. Am I cheating by shoehorning a mainstream superhero comic onto this list? Absolutely. Is it legitimately better, on an objectively literary level, than, say, World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer or Tedward by Josh Pettinger, both of which my arbitrary cap of five entries prevented me from including? It is not. But it was as delightful and true a distillation of the mainstream superhero ethos as one could hope for; Mark Waid (having been unleashed at last on his proper home of DC Comics after a decade in exile) is at the top of his game; and Chris Samnee remains an artist incapable of making an unnecessary pencil stroke. I liked it. Existential Comics: Selected Stories 1979-2004 by R. Crumb. Like most sensible critics, I have ambivalent feelings about Robert Crumb. His new floppy of original material this year, Tales of Paranoia, was a reminder of the sort of unreconstructedly retrograde and paranoid worldview Crumb has always embodied (his continued adherence to anti-vax conspiracies was, alas, predictable). But this Dan Nadel-edited collection of some of Crumb’s most outstanding comics is a reminder of the other side of that personality — the originality, lack of apology, and phenomenal artistic versatility that has always made R. Crumb inimitable in his field. The book is wonderful and troubling, as an underground ought to be. *** (articles) (top) Paul Jon Milne / Suture At first sight I thought, “won't get arsed by Milne throwing out a comic with a flying v(agina) flanged upon”, but I confused it with an angelic shape, which avowedly happens a lot to me. The author's topping last year's triple efforts of Creep Heap 2025, Limit Formation Initial, and These Aren't My Brutes, with his telling of an epic of Frankensteinian proportions, wherein a creature might suffer alone by getting its parts together. Palpable the pain it went through when being subject to crazy bio engineers trying to conquer soil they're not rooted in, empathized on the total alienation felt, while following fascinated a setting staged in a way only Milne is capable of, thanks to his unique graphic skills powering his narration. Furthermore I was dead sure he created the impressive coloring with crayons, but he corrected me, when I asked him on Bluesky about it: “the 'big' pages were often coloured with felt pens or acrylic paint, or both, but the bulk of it's mostly just flat photoshop colours. I liked using felt pens, they were my favourite pages. They run out fast though, would like to colour a whole comic with them at some point but I need to buy more ... used too-bright lightbox for the felt pen layers, which often didn't give me a clear impression of the colours or the shapes at all, so I just winged it and had fun, and I liked the results.” Such is Paul, a modest and gentle man. Ingrīda Pičukāne / Feminae Explorarum (kuš!) A fascinating collection of former published musings on fashion, colors, and French (the language), where women do what they're supposed to do: not suffering, picking mushrooms while moving through the woods like they're catwalking a fashion editorial, sending drunkards to a voyage on a river like Frankenstein's creature was about to do before Whale had to cut it out, flooding the world with rivers of menstrual blood, and so on. James Corcoran / Stramash 63 (self-published, Kickstarter) Hard knocks, but are you ruff enuff, dog lovers? This is a kind of sequel to the first three Stramash issues, and the plotting does plant the evil that men do in different ages, but bloodshed knows no history, except for chronicler James Corcoran, with support on colo(u)rs by Colin Bell. If you're into PI stuff, the classic way, but with a sense of wonder, this is your joint. The broad-brush henchmen in this are overtly ghastly, just sayin. Deniz Camp, Javier Rodríguez / Absolute Martian Manhunter (National Periodical) Vertigo'd: Right now I have no knowledge of any series that's pulling the rug from under your feet in a more effective way, and I dunno why you have to resurrect a label like Vertigo – which should be left dead for good – especially, if your portfolio features series like AMM, the fantastic Kryptonite Spectrum mini by the Ice Cream Man weirdos, or what Zatannic Panic could've been, if it would've went more in the body horror direction the Plastic Man story featured solely chose. Gerry Duggan, Kelvin Mao, Robert Windom, Jae Lee, June Chung / This Ends Tonight (Image) Three's a charm, or three story lines being interwoven while colliding at different time stamps: And I say Bill Everett's the forefather or -mother to Jae Lee's Namor and ~ita plus everything that followed. Just check the faces of the submariner and especially the fighting girls portrayed by Everett every now and then and compare those to the protas in This Ends Tonight, the energy generated by the artwork is of a kinetic kind rarely seen elsewhere, maybe in L'Intervista by Manuele Fior, or La Guerre by Thomas Cadène and Loïc Sécheresse. From a majority of the team that brought you Seven Sons. Liam Sharp et al /The Savage Sword of Conan #8 (Titan) Sharp as a sword: Like in the days of Doré, Foster, or Raymond, magazine's like that are the main justification for print's existence, because digital does the stellar artwork of one Liam Sharp no justice at all. Its overwhelming effect is reminiscent of that time when you were opening your first Planet of The Apes mag to discover Mike Ploog's and Tom Sutton's filigree black and white contributions to Terror On The Planet Of The Apes, and of course, and because it's so obvious, we'll have to squeeze Barry Windsor-Smith in here, too. There's a full issue done by Sharp, the eleventh, but I didn't manage to read it by now, because I have a life. But I bet it's overwhelming. Various / Back Issue #157: Keith Giffen tribute (TwoMorrows Publications) Excerpt from an interview, that drove me to tears: CADIGAN: Was that the one time in your career when you put your heart and soul into your work more so than any other? GIFFEN: I always try to throw 100 percent of myself into the work, but I guess the Legion thing, there was a little bit more in there, a little bit more in terms of what I really wanted to do in terms of storytelling and tone in a book. Yeah, I guess that was. Out of all the work I'd done for DC up until that point, yeah, Legion was the book that I put that little bit of extra into-the "Five Years Later." Lina Müller, Luca Schenardi / Plant Based Monster Trucks (Nieves) The one wherein I asked the question “Now, what's your stance on comics”, and identified as a latitudinarian. Yvan Alagbé / The Midnight Traveler ; Le Voyageur (Èditions Adverse) An excerpt from an upcoming meditation on the colonial phantoms still ruling over white minds: “That for his 2025 release The Midnight Traveler Yvan Alagbé chose the most odd of all the otherwise loincloth-sporting gents, who, if not dressed in a costume, obviously goes by the name of Kit Walker, might be due to the myth behind the seemingly immortal man, because the Phantom job gets passed on from father to son when cracking with old age. Le Voyageur, an essayist pamphlet leporello initially created for the Italian edition of Yellow Negroes, or, as the legend goes, *hidden in it*, and republished just this autumn by one of the French publishing houses most dedicated to the art of bookbindery, Éditions Adverse, presents jungle plagiarism and fumetti neri italiani pastiche galore, a meta-textual retelling of the relationships between black and white, readable as an allegory on the depiction of people of color still held hostage in territories of white fantasy. 't was created by a certain Démoniak, who also published a four part mini series named Eros negro (jouer avec le feu), which translates as Black Desire (Playing with Fire).” sleepyhouse2 / hard core drugs (self-published, online) The online cmcs dept. update for 2025: Maxim Peter Griffin continues to run on full steam, while Tym Godek's motor seemingly started stuttering a bit, but nonetheless provided us with insights on the dynamics developing between love and charismARTic, as did Derek M. Ballard on the daily fight of a bringing-up father; the latter both having new print manifestations on their hands; Tym Godek at Domino, and Dr. Ballard at Adventure Time. MEANWHILE, sleepyhouse2 entered the scene. Her web comic hard core drugs, running on Bluesky and Tumblr – as every good comic should – visually evokes a German comic strip series from the 1950s, Manfred Schmidt's Nick Knatterton, a parody intentionally born out of its creator's wishes to drag the idiocy of comics into the limelight after reading an issue of Superman, but unfortunately spotlighted said idiocy in such brightness, that soon it began to outshine the stars, and finally became one itself. Add some Clamp-influenced manga shizzle, ca. Clover, to the concept, and you get a drug dramedy of its very own kind, by diving into the realms of addiction and self-exploitation. But what I love the most about it, is its recurring use of German and Yiddish, the latter in a kinship with the German language, which makes the association with Nick Knatterton a tad obvious, nicht wahr? *** (articles) (top) 1. Monsieur Chouette, David B, L'Association This is a tale about the nature of fear, the imagination and the afterlife. It's also the best thing David B has done since Epileptic. BUT: After 35 years, the trailblazing L'Association risks extinction due to production/transport costs, the squeeze on indie bookstores and the huge amount of well-publicized competition from big BD publishers. I urge you to join as a member (benefits include a discount their on their 800+ work catalogue, which gave you Epileptic, Persepolis and Emmanuel Guibert's Alan's War). Or just make a small contribution here. 2. Béla sans monde, Simon Roussin, Editions 2042 Roussin is one of today's most original artists. This is psychedelia beyond psychedelia, with poetic storytelling and specially-printed, fluorescent pages. Gorgeous and hallucinatory. 3. An Illustrated Treasury of Russian Curses, Ass Edition (жопа), Pollard & Kuznetsova Canadian cartoonist Jess Pollard and journalist Elmira Kuznetsova turn мат, Russia's age-old art of cursing into English counterparts with matching cartoons. Their work is now a globally popular, five-book series. (I'm a Russian student, but you don't have to be.) All volumes come as E-books; not recommended for kids, unless they're kids who want to shock immigrant parents. In 2026, also look for Pollard's upcoming It's Just Crabs, "a tragic tale of crab evolution". 4. Le repaire de la Meduse, Brecht Evens, Actes Sud BD/ Musée Thomas Henry The French/English catalogue of a museum show (the cover unfolds into a two-sided artwork) that featured Evens' work with Atelier Michael Woolworth. In it, the artist discusses visual language, his artistic partnership and different forms of printing, alongside special pages from his exceptional, ongoing Le Roi Meduse ("The Jellyfish King"). 5. Marseille tatouée ("Marseille tattooed"), group work, Éditions Fotokino A great idea, beautifully executed by some favorite folks: Annabelle Perrin, Nine Antico, Bonnefrite, Cagne Canine and Simon Roussin. Artists asked residents of Marseille about their tattoos, then drew the speakers. A special mention also for Nine Antico's 2025 album Une Obsession (Dargaud). 6. L'Enquete qui Pietinait ("The Stalled Investigation"), Benoit Jacques, Benoit Jacques Books A 32-page parody of a police procedural in the simple form of a newsprint paper. Matchless silliness and hilarity from of my all-time favorite artists. Helped make my year. 7. Smoke Signals, Gary Panter, Desert Island, Brooklyn Another newsprint gem; more people should be drawing and printing these! Newsprint has a great comic history; use it more! 8. Vu de L'Atlantique, Serge Clerc, Éditions Barbier L'Atlantic is one of several bars Clerc frequented during a couple of difficult years. This contains his sketchbook from the time, with everything he sketched and overheard. All the art is in his signature angular, retro style and page 180 has one of the best bar stories I've ever heard. 9. Signé Coco, Les Arènes, Corinne "Coco" Rey A nice fat collection of cartoons by Coco, a true pioneer (and not because of her sex). Organized by theme and containing the Charlie Hebdo cover Coco drew after the Nov. 13 massacres: the spirit of French cartooning in an image. 10. Les Oiseaux, Noam Courtois, Brigitte Boulent Editions 2025 Noam, who was seven-and-a-half during the Covid quarantine, kept himself occupied by drawing birds. This is a collection of them published by his grandmother. No one sees like kids. *** (articles) (top) Res ipsa loquitur “Cast” (Hagai Palevsky, Aaron Losty, Marissa Louise, Claire Napier, Self-Published). A wind-up gag, the type of joke in which the build-up to the punchline becomes the actual subject, is very hard to do right; it requires a dozen tiny variations on the same thing, a slow rising of the stakes, each one functioning as a joke by itself. “Cast” is a near-perfect example of such a gag, building its sixteen pages ever upwards until one almost reaches the heaven (that is both figurative and literal in this case) Last Summer at Camp Righteous (Ollie Hicks, Good Comics). A continuation of Hicks’ usual themes (Americana, religious hypocrisy, fucking) that never fail to entertain. There’s a knife-edge balance to these characters, who can both caricatures and people at the same time. Nap Comix (Rachel Smith, self-published). Kids say the darndest things. Crickets #9 (Sammy Harkham, Breakdown Press). The best part of Blood of the Virgin was the cowboy actor story (the one in color); so it’s nice to see Harkham surrendering to popular demand and doing another cowboy story in living color. This issue starts in a more traditional manner before going to Looney Tunes territory for its (extremely long, extremely satisfying) climax. No need to read any previous entries, or even follow the plot that heard, just sit back and enjoy world-class cartooning. Judge Dredd: And To the Sea Return (Rob Williams, Henry Flint, Annie Parkhouse, Rebellion). I wasn’t quite as keen on this story as some of the previous Judge Dredd "epics" (which are thankfully still rather short), never the most subtle of strips but he can certainly make the implicit into the explicit one time too many. Still … any excuse to see Henry Flint make another showcase of himself. You find yourself wondering why the American market didn’t try to poach him and thankful he isn’t misused on some terrible superhero story. A rare talent that started great and just keeps getting better. “Duke Ellington on Mars” (Michael D. Kennedy, Drawn &amp; Quarterly). The rest of Kennedy’s 2025 collection of comics, Milk White Steed, swings between ‘very good’ to ‘very very good’ but this short story is outright great. Pure comics poetry, as ridiculous as it is sublime. Red Night (Hanawa Kazuichi, translated by Ryan Holmberg, Breakdown Press). This book is gross, sick, violent, pornographic, morally reprehensible, visually nauseating, intellectually confused, physically painful (it gave me a paper cut) … god help me, I loved it. Legend of Kamui (Shirato Sanpei, translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, Alexa Frank, Drawn and Quarterly). Shirato Sanpei’s massive historical saga seems like the stuff cliches are made of, but it is simply because you are looking at the pure source of these cliches. And, of course, everything that you think you know of historical manga, the kind that glorified battle and the bravery of the samurai, is best forgotten about. Sanpei casts his net wide as he chronicles the life of the rich and the poor, the noble and the worker, the great and the small … the only weakness one could point to is that the net is sometimes too wide — with the cast of characters becoming as complex as that of a Tolstoy novel. Would that all works would make such complaints necessary. “Zorn’s Lemma” (Chloe, self-published). A new work by Chloe that is like a Jazz standard run through the thematic obsession of an early grindcore album. Not sure if its aiming at John Zorn but it is the closest a comic book (or probably any other non-music medium) came close to aping the sensation of listening to Naked City for the first time. World Within the World: Collected Minicomix and Short Works 2010-2022 (Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics). The most striking things about this collection is: a) that Julia Gfrörer is only with us since 2010, since the impact of her work is so crushing you just assume she'd been there long before; B) even when doing stuff that reads like a typical webcomics gag (what is Fraser met Akira?) her pencils and attitude give the whole thing a sharp sensation that raises above the obviousness of the gag. That’s her work, a small knife so sharp you fail to notice you’ve been stabbed until you look down and see the pool of blood. *** (articles) (top) As I write this it is nearly Christmas 2025. This year, like every year, I look back and get bad feelings in the pit of my stomach about all the books I didn’t read and all the cons I didn’t table. Then I get an email, asking me for my list of favorite reads of the year and I feel like a phony. I imagine a cartoonist Christmas office party, I am standing behind the monstera as much, as it allows, with any luck I won’t get noticed. Then I think of what I draw and realise that won’t happen. The following books are titles I read this year, which really spoke to me with their expressions of visceral existence, humanity, whimsy and draughtsmanship. I enjoyed them all very much. Help!, Ethan Llewellyn and Francis Todd, Self-Published Filth, Underground Kingdom Comix Anthology, artists: Mat Greaves, Vincent Bell, Robertson, @__Threesix, steven Harper, Olly telling, Struan Sloan, Matt Simmons, Adam Falp, covers: Ethan Llewellyn, Kai Reynolds, Harry Deane Willmott, Francis Todd Tedward, Josh Pettinger, Fantagraphics 2x, Carol Swain, Dark and Golden Books The Devil’s Grin Book One, Alex Graham, Fantagraphics Astorial Compendium of Short Stories featuring Tamblyn the Secret Architect, Ed Pinsent, Self Published Worms, Book the Second, Erika Price, self published I will now release my koala death grip on the monstera, tell myself I can be a normal person who talks to folks; I did read some great work this year and table at some lovely places. I am VERY lucky to be in such great company and have their work in my life. *** (articles) (top) Punica Fides. A new book by one of the greatest Italian artists active today. It tells the story of a city in ruins, where the population is fighting in a never-ending conflict within itself and with the authorities. Bruno’s imagery is intense and dark, soaked in dense black inks. Bruno is a pure comic artist, one who never compromises his vision. The JoJolands. Many years after the last time I read anything from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, this new installment brought me back to Hirohiko Araki’s work. He probably has already invented and done everything he had to, but after nine series the madness of this series and the super dynamic art is still so exhilarating. I’m collecting the Japanese edition, which looks beautiful. Penguin Gohan. In Your In Face Comix, a very courageous small Italian publisher has released a collection of short stories by Shigesato Itoi and Terry King, the master of heta-uma, and I couldn’t be happier. The craziest stuff you could ever come across, still looking so fresh and avant-garde after over 40 years. Still from the same publisher, I also had the chance to read a collection of shorts by Kazuichi Hanawa from the 70s, entitled Chiaro di Luna, who some may remember for his autobiographical Doing Time. His fiction is disturbing and deeply fascinating. Les moutons veulent du sel, a graphic novel by my friend Emanuele Cantoro, published in France by Ça et Là, tells the story of a child growing up on the outskirts of Rome who finds a form of salvation through nature and a flock of sheep. Cantoro’s art is spontaneous and strikingly fresh. Monsieur Chouette. The new graphic novel by Monsieur David B (in France by L’Association and in Italy by Sigaretten with the title Signor Civetta) is a wild, oneiric journey into the land of the dead, somewhere between the Divine Comedy and Alice in Wonderland. The book is a thick, visionary, funny, and unsettling experience. Takemitsu Zamurai and Nihon no Kyōdai. Two manga by Taiyo Matsumoto were published in Italy this year. Both are relatively old works and very different from each other. Takemitsu Zamurai (originally published in Japan between 2005 and 2009, in Italy by Edizioni BD/J-Pop Manga) is a slow, dreamlike samurai story with mesmerizing artwork, while Nihon no Kyōdai (in Italy by Coconino Press) is a collection of stories from the early 1990s that tell you what Matsumoto was going to become in the future and at the same time almost feel as if they could have appeared in Garo in the 1970s. My Friend Kim Jong Un, a thoroughly researched and very entertaining book on the history of the Korean Peninsula, confirms once again the talent of Keum Suk Gendry-Kim, one of the most brilliant cartoonists working today. I live how her comics can be so many things at the same time: funny, intelligent, grotesque, delicate, and so much alive, just like her smooth and fascinating art. I’ve read the Italian edition by Bao Publishing, while in France the book is available from Futuropolis and in English soon by Drawn & Quarterly. The short-story collection The Green Hand and Other Stories by Nicole Claveloux was finally published in Italian by Eris Edizioni (available in English by New York Review Comics, 2022), and a major exhibition dedicated to her work was held in my hometown, Bologna, during the A occhi aperti festival. Claveloux was part of the French comics new wave of the late 1970s and '80s, blending psychedelic atmospheres with highly technical, Topor-inspired drawing. Reading her work pushed me into a '70s trip, collecting old issues of classic French magazines like Charlie and, of course, Métal Hurlant. I also discovered the work of Lika Nüssli from Switzerland — amazing artist and wonderful person — and returned to old sentimental sports manga by Mitsuru Adachi, as well as early issues of Rumiko Takahashi’s Ranma ½. I’ve recently picked up the new Crickets by Sammy Harkham and Gary Panter’s Smoke Signal. I haven’t read the collection Tongues by Anders Nilsen (which I expect to see mentioned often on this page), just because I am already collecting the series (which I hope to see in Italy soon, hopefully translated by me, just like Big Questions). Toward the end of the year, Canicola delighted Italian readers with two books I had been eagerly waiting for: the dreamy and stylish Il sogno della cicala by Dario Sostegni and Raffaele Sorrentino, and Il bus incantato, a true story from Iran told by the very talented Majid Bita. And then, a big shout-out to all the good comics I forgot to mention. *** (articles) (top) Favorite books of 2025 … Frankly, I still have a huge pile of more than 30 unread books beside my bed! I also skipped talking about all the small press gems that I gathered this year in Montreal, Toronto and Rome. So here goes: a mixture of English and French, some familiar to the Comics Journal readership and some secret gems for the more curious and audacious readers out there. Books whose design and format transcend the norm; where the artist went further and farther to produce a cross between a graphic novel and an art book/object. These books are usually treasured for a long time and 2025 produced a lot. Goes Like This, Jordan Crane, Fantagraphics Books I have every comic book Jordan Crane ever did and I probably have already seen all the material in this compilation but WOW! When I got a hold of this book and flipped through it, the beauty of the design, from the texture of the paper to the the printing and the spine, knocked me out. It is just an incredibly beautiful book that showcases the advance in printing technics. Granted, it’s not cheap! It’s a must for anybody interested in that type of art book/graphic novel hybrid that rises above all the others. Thank you Fantagraphics for taking risks and producing such gems. Tongues Vol. 1, Anders Nilsen, Pantheon Books Over the years I did buy from Nilsen at TCAF a few of the individual chapters but when this volume came out, I was curious to see if it was going to include the cut out pages and all the little extras that cost a fortune to print and is usually reserved for shorter hand assembled print runs. Well, Pantheon did an amazingly fateful job on this one. L’infiniment moyen et plus si infinités dans les limites finies d’une édition minimaliste, Marc-Antoine Mathieu, Delcourt I don’t think any of his boundary pushing work has been translated in English, am I wrong? All of his books are narrative experiments, and Mathieu manages each time to produce a theatrical experience within the pages of his graphic novels. So far, he’s included cut out panels, a pop-up, conceptual stories where for example, you begin that story in the middle, a story that takes place within seconds. This artist challenges himself at every opportunity. His latest is very cheeky. Using a magnifying glass, he drew as small as he could an 82 pages story fitting in a one inch book that is packaged with a magnifying glass. Mathieu has managed to draw something even smaller than the smallest Chris Ware text! The packaging is beautiful, it’s an art object/graphic novel/high concept album. It’s also funny in a Kafka way, as the title is probably the longest ever for the tiniest graphic novel ever drawn and printed. Muséum, Eric Lambé, FRMK FRMK are know for difficult books and as ambitious as FRMK are, their books are not for the average reader of comics. They produce gorgeous books for adults interested in the combination of literature and art. Eric Lambé has had great success lately with Antipodes (Casterman), an album written by David B. that came out in 2024. In this solo outing, Lambé’s book is about what you experience and take away from a museum, images bound in sensations and feelings. Lambé manages to create a playful narrative, sometimes abstract, sometimes surreal with very little dialogue. The work of a master. Lézards rêves, Jean Giraud Moebius, Moebius production Moebius production’s new book explores and showcases excerpts from the artist sketchbooks. It’s like discovering a caché of gems that Giraud/Moebius left behind after passing away. This book is filled with gorgeous improvised illustrations and short stories that reminds us of his mastery in fishing out striking images from his subconscious mind. The book itself is small, a beauty to hold and behold. The Moon and the Serpent Bumper Book of Magic, Alan Moore and Steve Moore, Top Shelf This reminds me of The Museum of Lost Wonder by Jeff Hoke, published by Weiser in 2006. It tackled the same subject, magic and the occult sciences, in the same way, both sharing an illuminating vision of the world of magic, explaining and putting these things in perspective. They are fun books: playful, erudite but accessible. In the case of The Moon and the Serpent, probably the last ever comics from Alan Moore. Just for that reason (but there are many more), seek it out. And a few more, in a more classical format. Bowling with Corpses, Mike Mignola, Dark Horse When I heard Mignola was doing original stories after Hellboy, I bought this book but I put it away because, somehow, I expected to be disappointed. How could he top his work with Hellboy? Well I can report that it was quite the opposite. Unshackled by the heavy mythology created for the Hellboy universe, these new stories are a breath of fresh air. Funny, whimsical and amazing page layouts, this book shows that Mignola is a master storyteller/artist and I look forward with glee to what he will uncover in this new universe that he’s created. Soozy No 1 and no 1 1/2, Seosie, self-published Okay, here’s at least one independent book from TCAF that I got it this year. New pages from Seosie were also published in Charlotte mensuel in France. It’s really difficult to illustrate sexual situations and make it cute and and funny. A lot of people still associate pleasure with violence and punishment. Not so here with Seosie. She is such a talented artist, able to paint realistic canvas and then switch to cartoony figures for these books, while her drawings are still exquisite and expressive. The French in France have already discovered her! Your turn now… Absolute Martian Manhunter, Camp and Rodriguez, DC I am not that into multiverses and superhero comic books — corporate products spiked with new sauces every few years! A good friend gave me Absolute Martian Manhunter by Camp and Rodriguez knowing I would like that one … and I did. The LSD-tinged visuals within create a really interesting narrative mixing nearly abstracts visuals and symbols within a more classic comics grid, but with a modernistic twist. A really interesting experiment by both authors within the trappings of the genre. Wishing they’ll attempt something like that someday, but in a more adult vein with their own characters.\ Tales of Paranoia, Robert Crumb, Fantagraphics books I have missed Crumb, it’s been decades since I bought one of his 32-page comic book. Here, he reminds us that he is still a master at this! His stories are rich, compact, deep and layered. More please Robert! And here we enter the French zone ... L’association strikes back! This year, as l’Association still struggles with the financial comic book bubble that is bursting in France, three founders of l’Association came out with excellent graphic novels and story collection, reminding us that they are still at the top of their creative game. Monsieur Chouette, David B., L’Association After many years, a return to a longer black and white narrative that follows two main characters as they go into hell as imagined by David B. David’s stark black and white images result in some of the most interesting and gorgeous composition within a page that I have seen in 2025. No one is more adept at balancing black and white masses and turning them into light and darkness. A work by a master storyteller. La fin du monde, Stanislas, L’Association This is a collection of short stories in a ligne claire style. It's a melt-in-your-mouth goodness though the eyes experience! A complete delight. MENU, 30/40, Jean-Christophe Menu, L’Apocalypse Comic legend and designer Etienne Robial relaunched the 30/40 collection that he used to publish at Futuropolis with an issue written and drawn by Jean-Christophe Menu. Again, Menu shows off his complete mastery of the form and proposes multiple stories, longer works on the passing of his father and mother are moving and touching, elegys from the heart. Menu also revisits past series and characters and shows that he is still one of the mort important contemporary French comic creator. Québec highlights. Distributed mostly in Quebec book shops (with a few copies shipped out to France and Belgium), most of the States and English Canada have no idea that such a vibrant community publishes really distinctive and original works in French within Canada. Once in a while Drawn and Quarterly, Conundrum Press and POW POW will translate some, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. ROTOTO, Richard Écrapou, Monsieur ED Richard Écrapou (best know as Richard Suicide), winner in 2015 of the best Québec graphic novel, has been illustrating books for kids for quite some time with great success. This is the first time Richard, who is know in Quebec comics for his writing stye for adults, tackles his first kids story by himself. What you wind up is kinda of an artists book for kids, in the vein of Françoise Mouly’s Toon Books but with a sharper and edgier vision. Libres d’Obéir, Casterman et Le Prince des Oiseaux de Haut Vol, La Pastèque, Philippe Girard Philippe Girard, who burst on the international scene with the Leonard Cohen biography, On A Wire (Drawn and Quarterly), had a stellar year in 2025. His book chronicling Antoine de St-Exupéry’s stay in Québec during world war two, and months prior to writing The Little Prince, explores where he was in his life and suggests what might have led him to writing the second most popular book of all time. This graphic novel by Philippe and the following that came out a few months after, Libre d’Obéir showcases his innovative layouts which often plays with graphics and symbols. adapted from Johann Chapoutot’s essay, it is essential to understanding our current events as it explores how the Nazi work ethics was co-opted by big corporations, from Germany to the United States. Really good adult subject matter rendered by an author reaching a peak in his career. Interludes de Courtoisie, Noémie Poulin, Moelle Graphik Three stories, weaved both symbolically and figuratively into a wordless narrative. Not quite abstract, this book somehow casts a spell: an hypnotic flow of images takes over you when you start reading. Mysterious and hard to define, an expending worldview told though images. Magical in the purest way possible, like real life can sometimes be. Filles du Roy (origines), Louis Rémillard and Dom Leblond, Septentrion Louis Rémillard is one of the first self-publishing Quebec artists who became active in the '70s. In the last few years, as he passages seventy years of age, he managed to hit his stride with richly detailed and historically accurate stories about the First Nations in Quebec and Canada. His latest, working with scriptwriter Dom Leblond, is a long term chronicle about the King’s daughters (les filles du Roy), mostly women living in poverty in France who in 1663, who were enticed to sail to the new world and settle in New France (Québec), marry and populate the French colonies. With his eye for fascinating details, Rémillard illustrates a engaging story about the trip these women undertook to get to North America. A rich, entertaining and fascinating read. Pierre Fournier: Le Capitaine Québec, Jean-Dominic Leduc, La Pastèque, Okay, at least one French book on Québec comics history. It might even be sold out by the time this list appears. Still, Jean-Dominic Leduc does an incredible job of retelling Pierre Fournier’s journey as he attempts, through the creation of comic book characters like Capitaine Kébec, to create a viable space for Quebec comics creator to thrive in the seventies and eighties. Much more than a biography, thought Fournier’s eyes, we witness how the pioneering efforts by Fournier and other like Jacques Hurtubise, played out and created the basis for what would become the modern Quebec comic book/bande dessinée Montreal scene. A fast paced fantastic read with a rich visual iconography. Spread Love Comix No. 30, edited by Uncle Gil, Spread Love Smaller than a regular comix, Spread Love has been coming out monthly for a few years now. A love letter to those underground seventies anthologies, it features a lot of new young underground comix voices like Robin Bougie and Dexter Cockburn. It usually has an interesting short interview conducted by Uncle Gil (with the likes of Dennis Kitchen and Dave Cooper) and a selection of comics that are trashy, a bit shocking to some, but in the end, it all amounts to good clean (and dirty) fun. This one is published in English.

Title: The €170bn 'resting' in Irish bank accounts
URL: https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/economy/arid-41764874.html
Time Published: 2025-12-27T02:06:53Z

Try from €1.50 / week Try from €1.50 / week €1 in every €7 earned in Ireland is now being saved by households, underpinned by rising income and a fall in consumption. Irish households are saving money at a rate not seen since the pandemic-induced highs of the early 2020s with recent data showing the savings rate hitting the highest levels since the middle of 2022. However, much of that money languishes in deposit accounts which offer little in the way of returns for customers as inflation erodes its value. Recently released figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows that Irish households are continuing to add to their deposit accounts with the savings rate rising to almost 15% between July and September, up 2% from the previous quarter. The current savings rate is also notably above the average of 13.1% since the beginning of 2023. It said that €1 in €7 is now being saved by households, which is being underpinned by rising income and a fall in consumption. According to data from the Central Bank of Ireland, as of the end of October, the total value of household deposits stood at €170.3bn marking the first time in the history of the data series that this figure surpassed €170bn - an increase of €2bn compared to September and an increase of €11.3bn in the year to the end of October. Even though all categories had a positive contribution, overnight deposits - which is money largely kept in current accounts - was the main driver, reporting a positive flow of €1.9bn during the month. The CSO said that savings can add to a household's overall wealth in the form of buying new homes, growing bank deposits, pension savings, and paying off debt. Managing director of Cork-based financial planning firm Alpha Wealth Nick Charalambous said the reality is a lot of Irish depositors are “getting next to zero interest” on their savings with inflation eroding its value over time. "Don't leave your money sitting dormant in the banks, the post office, credit unions,” he said. Financial planner with Castle Capital Colum Carroll said inflation is the “real killer” of wealth and investing money, whether it be through a pension or other mechanisms, allows people to plan better for the future. "People often see investments as being risky, but I think the narrative kind of needs to change around that again…Not investing can actually be even more risky. The risk of running out of money, the risk of not having enough money in the future, or losing purchasing power. They're the kind of real risks,” he said. Mr Charalambous said a part of the reason for people keeping money on deposit or in savings is the fear of losing it and maybe a lack of understanding of the options that are out there for people to make their money work harder particularly over the medium to long term. When looking into what to do with all their savings, Mr Charalambous said households should consider the timeframe for when they need the savings as this will dictate the appropriate financial vehicle. In the short-term, which would be three years or less, he says that money should be kept on deposit. "Most of us are now used to using Revolut. With their introduction of savings and deposit rates as well as investment accounts, there are millions upon millions of euros going into those types of savings,” he said, however, there are better returns offered by other non-Irish entities. “Raisin would be my preferred one, and the main reason for that is that they use physical banks. With Raisin you can get a sort of a three month starter rate with Raisin themselves who are triple a rated institution at 3.1% gross, and typically the demand deposit rates with Raisin are in and around 2.15%,” he said. After covering expenses and managing savings for the short-term, Mr Charalambous said people should be prioritising longer-term investments such as a pension. "Unfortunately, we all live in the here and now, and it's very difficult for us to kind of visualize a scenario where we are basically benefiting from building up this very tax efficient investment vehicle, which is a pension,” he said. In the medium term, which would be four years or longer, Mr Charalambous said there are investment options from the likes of Irish Life, Aviva, and Zurich which offer “very broad investment solutions”. Mr Charalambous said all investments should be reviewed at least once a year. Given the growth of Revolut, along with other financial applications, people have become a lot more familiar with investing themselves in stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In these apps, people can choose to manage their own investments with the money being easily accessible should the customer need to make a withdrawal. However, Mr Charalambous warned that the options often offered in these apps are very concentrated and largely dependent on US stock markets. "The Vanguard S&P 500 as an example, is the most common ETF globally, where most people start with and put too much exposure to. But it's a very narrow fund, because it's concentrated purely in the US, solely in 500 companies,” he said, adding that it is largely dependent on the growth of the Magnificent Seven. “Yet we've seen gold has done spectacularly well this year. European equities have typically outperformed the US particularly if you take into account the dollar weakness that we've seen this year.” Growth in the US stock market is heavily concentrated on just a handful of companies nicknamed the Magnificent Seven - Google’s parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - which brings with it a lot of risk particularly if there is a falloff in the tech sector. Nvidia, the most valuable company in the world, has seen its stock price surge over the course of the year as tech companies scramble to buy as many of its graphics processing units (GPUs) as possible to put into data centres to power their AI models. Nvidia alone accounts for over 7% of the S&P 500. Mr Charalambous said the Vanguard S&P 500 is a “speculative type of investing” and the risk might be higher than they realise. "People typically wouldn't realize the level of risk that they may be undertaking when they go into a fund like that,” he said. Data from the Central Bank of Ireland shows the market value of Irish resident holdings of securities stood at just under €6 trillion (tn) as of the end of September - an increase of €353m over the quarter. Of this total, Irish pension funds account for €51bn while household investments account for €28.26bn. Listed shares accounted for €2.4tn of the total with the US being the primary destination for Irish resident investment in stocks accounting for 58% of the total value or €1.4tn. In comparison, the Irish stock market only accounts for 2% or €49bn, of the total money Irish investment in stocks. The surge in share valuations in the US stock market is primarily being driven by the Magnificent Seven of which many are heavily investing in AI and its supporting infrastructure, particularly data centres. However, as of yet, there has been little return on this investment for these companies and if the so-called AI bubble bursts, this could spell trouble for Irish investors who have a lot of money wrapped up in US stocks. In terms of households holdings of listed shares, it reached an all-time high during the third quarter reaching €11.5bn. However, this is largely due to the increase in the overall total market value which increased by around €700m in the quarter. During the budget in October, former finance minister Paschal Donohoe announced a reduction in the investment exit tax from 41% to 38% from January 1 which makes it a little cheaper to actually invest in ETFs or other investment products. This rate could come down in the future potentially reaching the 33% rate set for capital gains tax. Due to these tax changes, Mr Carroll said coming into 2026 it’s now “more advantageous” to invest than it has been over the last number of years because of the exit tax coming down. “Hopefully that should come down even more,” he said, adding that even if it came down to 33% it would still be quite high compared to the US and the UK. Capital gains tax is paid at 33% on the profits of the sale or disposal of certain access such as shares in a company or bonds. However, an exit tax is paid on the profit from an investment in a fund - such as an ETF - and is charged at 38%. In addition, under deemed disposal rules, that tax is liable to be paid every eight years regardless of whether the asset is sold or not. Given the lower rate of tax on holding single shares, rather than investing in broad funds, Mr Carroll said these rules do not "promote good investing”. “You get 33% if you hold a single stock which is very risky, versus holding a tiny, tiny percentage of tens of thousands of stocks all around the world, you get taxed heavily on that,” he said. "The best practice is, if you have the money now and you don't need access to it, now is the best time to invest,” he said. "Like long term investing isn't essentially risky, it's more the risk of not having enough money in the future or when you need it. If you don't have enough money to pay for your children's education fund, or you don't have enough money to retire at 65 and you need to continue to work longer than you'd hoped, that's the kind of real risk,” Mr Carroll said.

Title: Ethereum's TVL could skyrocket '10X' in 2026: Sharplink CEO

Time Published: 2025-12-26T23:46:28Z

A surge in stablecoins, tokenized RWAs and growing sovereign wealth fund interest could drive a major increase in Ethereum’s TVL in 2026, Sharplink’s co-CEO said. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) may surge ten-fold in 2026 as adoption expands across multiple use cases and institutional investors, according to Sharplink’s co-CEO Joseph Chalom. Sharplink Gaming is the second-largest public Ethereum treasury company, holding 797,704 ETH (ETH), worth roughly $2.33 billion at the time of publication, according to Ethereum Treasuries data. “The stablecoin market will hit $500B by the end of next year,” Chalom predicted in an X post on Friday, as the total stablecoin market capitalization currently sits at around $308.46 billion. A move to $500 billion would represent an increase of about 62%. With over half of the total stablecoin activity (54%) taking place on Ethereum, such a rise could potentially contribute to an increase in the network’s TVL. Chalom also expects tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) to see significant growth, forecasting the market will reach $300 billion in 2026. “Tokenized assets will 10X in AUM in 2026, going from tokenizing individual funds, stocks, and bonds to full fund complexes,” Chalom said. He pointed to rising interest over the past year from financial services companies including JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock as a major catalyst. An increasing TVL is often seen as a sign of growing interest in the network, which can bolster market sentiment and potentially influence the price of the asset. At the time of publication, Ethereum’s TVL is around $68.20 billion, according to DeFiLlama. However, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen said on Tuesday that Ether is unlikely to hit new highs in the coming year, given current conditions for Bitcoin. At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $2,924, down 3.12% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap. Chalom anticipates Ethereum holdings and tokenization activity by sovereign wealth funds to grow five- to tenfold over the next year. Related: Ethereum in 2026: Glamsterdam and Hegota forks, L1 scaling and more “In 2026 this will amplify meaningfully as competitive dynamics take hold. When no one was willing to touch crypto from this pool of allocators, it was safe to stay sidelined,” Chalom said. Chalom also predicted that onchain AI agents and prediction markets will “go mainstream,” which he said will drive more activity and value to the ecosystem.

Title: Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare?
URL: https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-meta-x-a-threat-to-NVDA-or-just-another-deepseek-market-scare/?utm_source=yahoofinance&amp;utm_medium=yahoofinance
Time Published: 2025-12-26T21:45:00Z
Full Content:
On Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%. The company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence. Because of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA, the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion. As an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance? On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter. At the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500. The MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing. For analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices. In turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out. But it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived. Now, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX. NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term. Over the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times. MetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years. Additionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success. Compounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.” Fund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.” Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. NVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon. The stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%. Over the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion.

Title: Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare?

On Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%. The company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence. Because of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA, the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion. As an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance? On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter. At the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500. The MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing. For analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices. In turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out. But it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived. Now, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX. NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term. Over the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times. MetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years. Additionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success. Compounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.” Fund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.” Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. NVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon. The stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%. Over the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion. Another strong indication of health is that current short interest stands at just 1.13% of the float. Before you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this.

Title: Etheruem’s tokenization role takes focus as Tom Lee outlines bullish outlook

Time Published: 2025-12-26T21:15:54Z

Fundstrat’s head of research said institutional tokenization supports a $7,000–$9,000 Ether price in early 2026 and a longer-term case for $20,000. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ethereum’s growing role in institutional finance took center stage on CNBC’s Power Lunch this week, when Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said Ether could climb to $7,000–$9,000 by early 2026 as Wall Street accelerates efforts to tokenize assets and move financial activity onchain. Lee said Ether’s (ETH) investment case is increasingly tied to its use as financial infrastructure, as Wall Street experiments with onchain settlement and tokenized securities. “Wall Street wants to tokenize everything,” Lee said, pointing to initiatives at Robinhood and BlackRock. The shift, he said, could bring efficiencies to traditional finance while anchoring real-world use cases on Ether. He added that Ether could eventually reach $20,000 as adoption deepens. He was also bullish on Bitcoin (BTC), calling it a “genuine store of value” and saying a move to $200,000 next year “makes a lot of sense,” framing its recent underperformance versus gold as temporary. Lee is also chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, the leading Ether-focused treasury company that has reported holdings of 4,066,062 ETH, according to CoinGecko data. Related: 70% of Ether positions are 'long' as whale accumulation tightens ETH supply Tokenized real-world assets, traditional financial instruments and physical assets represented onchain have expanded rapidly this year, with total market value rising to about $18.9 billion, up from roughly $5.6 billion at the start of 2025. According to data from RWA.xyz, US Treasury debt is the largest tokenized asset class at around $8.5 billion, followed by commodities at about $3.4 billion. Ethereum currently accounts for the majority of tokenized RWA value across public blockchains. As of late December 2025, the network hosts more than $12 billion in tokenized assets, well ahead of alternatives such as BNB Chain, Solana and Arbitrum. Ethereum also leads stablecoin issuance, with roughly $170 billion in stablecoins issued on the network, reinforcing its role as the primary settlement layer for dollar-denominated activity onchain. Institutional interest in tokenized RWAs continued to build in December, when the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) said it plans to tokenize a portion of US Treasury securities held at its Depository Trust Company subsidiary on the Canton Network. DTCC operates post-trade infrastructure for US securities markets, with its subsidiaries processing about $3.7 quadrillion in securities transactions last year.

Title: Expert Alleges Bitcoin Under Siege Again, ETFs And BlackRock Suspected

Time Published: 2025-12-26T19:52:41Z

The recent surge in Bitcoin (BTC) volatility has led to significant liquidations, prompting renewed suspicions of market manipulation among experts. A detailed analysis by market expert NoLimit on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) reveals that, at the time of the stock market opening, BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) IBIT transferred hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin into Coinbase Prime wallets. This timing and location indicate a pattern that institutions often follow when selling their assets. As explained, these coins are not sent to Coinbase Prime merely to remain inactive; they are typically directed there for sale or liquidity management purposes. NoLimit asserts that when a major player like BlackRock needs to liquidate assets or meet redemption demands, the price of Bitcoin reacts rapidly. He suggests that this situation reflects a combination of factors: selling related to ETFs taking place during low liquidity, inventory management in anticipation of upcoming volatility, and risk reduction in light of a significant derivatives event. Compounding these concerns, technical analyst OxNobler highlighted further developments that contributed to the recent downturn, detailing significant sell-offs by various trading platforms. In a rapid succession of transactions, Binance reportedly sold 10,155 BTC, Wintermute let go of 5,354 BTC, Coinbase disposed of 10,113 BTC, BlackRock sold 4,945 BTC, and Kraken moved 4,630 BTC. Collectively, these actions amounted to over $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin sold within a mere 30 minutes, raising suspicions of coordinated market manipulation. According to analysts from Bull Theory, the situation has taken a dire turn, with Bitcoin plummeting by $2,300 and liquidating $66 million in long positions in just 45 minutes. Against this backdrop, $60 billion has been wiped from the crypto market without any negative news triggering such a drastic shift. This scenario has led them to assert that manipulation continues to be a significant concern within the broader crypto market. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $87,340, down slightly more than 30% from its all-time highs set earlier in October.

Title: Meta Platforms Might Be the Biggest Bargain in Big Tech

Time Published: 2025-12-26T18:05:14Z

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © nextheprime / Shutterstock.com Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) certainly stands out as one of the bigger “deals” to be had in big tech for those looking to play the value side of the AI trade. Undoubtedly, when it comes to the Magnificent Seven, investors might wish to be more selective with which members of the famed group they buy going into the new year. Whether that’s due to the variance in performance between the individual names, the different slates of expectations set ahead of them, or their potential to make up ground in this AI race, there are reasons to get pickier when it comes to the most magnificent names atop this market. Since it feels unlikely that the non-stop chatter about stretched stock valuations, bubbles, and all the doubts that AI can live up to its potential will pull back in the new year, investors might need to increase their tolerance for turbulence going into the new year, especially with the companies that have been spending far more than your average investor might be comfortable with. At this juncture, the higher the AI spending bar, the higher the expectations bar is likely to be in the new year, and for companies like Meta Platforms, it seems like the shares are looking relatively cheap for a reason. But what happens if there are decent returns that lie just a bit further down the road that investors and analysts can’t yet see? In such a case, shares of Meta Platforms may very well be in for more consolidation or even downside before investors come to the realization that its AI strategy is paying off, perhaps many times over. Some upbeat analysts over at Morgan Stanley seem to think that the new year could be incredibly kind to the social-media juggernaut. Notably, they see revenue re-acceleration at the hands of stronger ad demand as well as improved performance of ads at the hands of AI. Add Reels and WhatsApp business messaging momentum into the equation, and it certainly feels like 2026 will see enough of an AI return to soothe the fears of the rising tide of AI spend. Another bull, Colin Sebastian, over at Baird, also thinks 2026 could be a good year for Meta Platforms shares. He thinks new AI models (think closed-source Avocado and Mango models, as Meta Platforms moves on from its open-source LLaMA model) might help push the name to $815 per share. Undoubtedly, the sudden and surprising shift from open-source to closed-source models might be a head-scratcher for some. Either way, it seems to be the right way to go, especially given industry trends. I think Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg can deliver more than a few surprises in the new year, as the company potentially looks to give investors what they want over the near- to medium-term while also ensuring enough is spent on the long-term opportunity at hand. On the one hand, some of the bears see the firm as spending a bit too much on AI efforts. On the other hand, some skeptics might see Meta Platforms as “lagging” in the AI race. Undoubtedly, there’s room to catch up if Meta AI is to catch up to the likes of the current leaders. Either way, it’s just too easy to be bearish on the stock right here. And that’s why the stage might be set for a big rally that helps shares catch up to the rest of the Mag Seven after a rough, but still positive (shares up 11% year to date) year. At the time of this writing, Meta Platforms’ shares are going for 22.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). That’s the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven, thanks in part to the nasty decline the stock encountered back in October. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Apparel performed especially strongly this holiday and there's some optimism that 2026 might be OK for the retail business. Senior Editor, Retail Between price hikes due to tariffs and inflation, sagging consumer confidence, and shoppers becoming choosier than ever, retailers had plenty to overcome this holiday season. But they managed to — and should emerge with sales 3 to 4 percent above last year’s holiday season, meeting or slightly surpassed their plans, according to commentary from about two dozen retailers, shopping center executives, analysts, and market researchers. How did they do it? Retailers offered values that were appealing and apparent. Consumers were willing to absorb tariff-related price increases, generally under 10 percent on fashion. And the weather was conducive to Americans getting out to shop, except where there was flooding in the Pacific Northwest and storms in the Midwest. California was battered with flooding rains on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and the Northeast got hit with a major snowstorm late Friday into Saturday. These likely reduced store visits for returns and shopping with gift cards and had some impact on business, but probably didn’t dramatically alter the outcome.

Income levels have been rising, but the unemployment rate is also increasing, reaching 4.6 percent as of November. You May Also Like Apparel has sold surprising well. Bestselling categories and looks were outerwear, cold-weather accessories, Fair Isle sweaters, fragrance, fur, faux fur, sleepwear including matching parent and kids sets, athleisure, and athletic footwear. Electronics also fared well, particularly video games. On the other hand, sales of home goods were on the soft side. Visa projected holiday spending (Nov. 1 to Dec. 31) in the U.S. will be up 4.2 percent year-over-year, led by sales of electronics. Mastercard forecasts a 3.9 percent year-over-year gain, with apparel the top category, generating a 7.8 percent sales increase. Those estimates fall in line with the National Retail Federation’s prediction of 3.7 to 4.2 percent holiday sales gains, and total U.S. holiday sales eclipsing $1 trillion for the first time. A clearer picture of how the 2025 season played out with sales and profits will emerge when retailers issue their fourth-quarter results in February and March. “This was a decent season, not great, but a good one,” said Jim von Maur, president and fourth-generation leader of the Davenport, Iowa-based Von Maur Department Stores. “In the Midwest we had horrific storms almost every weekend, but we’ve been catching up, and we’ll end the season in the 3 percent range. Men’s has been really strong. Cosmetics not as much. Fragrance has been good. Children’s has been very good.” Among the bestselling brands cited by von Maur were Skims, Uggs, Peter Millar, Vineyard Vines, Spanx, Hoka, and Cloud 9. “I think we are going to have strong business right after Christmas,” von Maur added. “People will continue to shop. I’m optimistic about that, but you never know about returns. People will be out shopping for deals. Our competitors seem to be promotional. We were restrained. We sold a lot at full-price and did not see [consumer] resistance to that.” “The Christmas selling season has been better than we anticipated,” said Stephen Yalof, president and chief executive officer of Tanger. “On Super Saturday, we saw sales levels in stores that rivaled Black Friday; in some cases there were even steeper levels. We saw stores taking half off everything, stacking discounts on top of discounts, giving gifts with purchase, even some door busters, but the promotions were planned for sure. I don’t think there was any desperation.” Regarding post-Christmas returns and shopping, Tanger was probably less impacted by the inclement weather since most of its 38 outlet centers and three open-air lifestyle centers are in warmer climates. Yalof listed Nike, Under Armour and Adidas in athletic apparel and footwear; Michael Kors, Coach and Tory Burch in accessories; Pandora and Kay in jewelry, and Gap and Old Navy in apparel as among the busiest destinations. “The season was good early on and good late and the lull in the middle lasted a little longer than we expected, so the shopping got bigger very late,” said one top retail executive, who said the season has been OK. Regarding the snow and rains post Christmas, “I don’t think that should change things dramatically.” One specialty retail executive at a company that also wholesales said, “We feel really fortunate. There could have been this perfect storm between tariffs, the price of gold going up at least 50 percent to $4,500, and the situation with Saks Global,” which hasn’t been paying vendors and seems headed for bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the source said, “Gold has been selling very strong.” Following an “amazing Black Friday,” business continued to churn throughout the holiday season at Brooks Brothers, according to CEO Ken Ohashi. “We’ll end the month in a good place,” he said. “We had a tremendous sportswear year,” he said, led by sweaters, knitwear and fashion items in seasonal colors and patterns. “A lot of our business is replenishment items, like our white button-down shirts and Golden Fleece blazers, but the disproportionate strength of our fashion offering tells me the customer is looking for newness,” he said. Ohashi said Brooks Brothers notched a strong number of new customers this year purchasing at full price. “Our consumer is pretty resilient and our dollars per transaction have been up all year,” he said.Bob Mitchell, CEO of Mitchells Stores, said the company’s 10 stores had “another record holiday season. To keep putting increases on every year is great. The formula is working — clients are just happy to be in a multibrand environment with high service.” Although Mitchells and Richards on the East Coast led the way, Wilkes Bashford stores in California, including the unit in Palo Alto that was up against a strong opening last year, also performed well. Marios stores in Seattle and Portland, Ore., “came on strong at the end,” Mitchell said, and the latest addition, Stanley Korshak in Dallas, also had a good season. For most of the company, traffic slowed at the end, Mitchell said, particularly in menswear, but overall, the business posted high-single-digit gains for the season. In men’s, top performers included luxury sweaters, outerwear and expensive casual pants from Marco Pescarolo. Zegna was the most popular brand along with Kiton, Brunello Cucinelli and Loro Piana. In women’s, “jewelry was the big winner,” along with expensive outerwear that “helped make up for the lighter traffic,” Mitchell said.“It was busy the last few days before Christmas, which caught me a little by surprise,” said Ken Giddon, president of Rothmans, which operates men’s stores in New York City and the nearby Westchester County. “I’m surprised at the tenacity of the consumer. There was a crazy amount of gift giving. Our suburban stores were a little light on merchandise because of the big late push. I guess we did a good job picking the right things.” Giddon said the strongest sellers included Eleventy and Peter Millar, a brand that ran out of stock early, and an indicator of the strength of the quarter-zip sweater trend. “We’re selling those to the younger guys as well as their dads.” Raffi sweaters, Barbour socks and Brax pants were also strong sellers. “As the weather changes, we get a big push in outerwear and we also benefit from kids coming home from college and shopping for suits,” Giddon said. Heather Kaminetsky, CEO of Net-a-porter, said in a statement, “This holiday season we’ve seen our customer buy gifts for others, but also for herself — with peaks in fine jewelry from David Morris and Jessica McCormack, cozy fashion pieces from Loewe and Khaite and accessories from The Row.” One retail CEO, who requested anonymity, said, “A lot of [retailers] have taken their units down and are riding on higher average unit retail prices. There’s less inventory out there. I think after last April, a lot of people scrambled to pull down some things because the cost of inventory went up, and so you really had to pick your shots. We took our assortment down. It was effective for us. It’s paying off in margin, in a year where margin has been hit hard with the increased cost of tariffs.” Asked if markdowns were steeper this year compared to 2024, the retailer said, “I don’t think the magnitude increased any. Q4 is the most promotional quarter. We all know that. But it’s also, for many of us, the lowest margin quarter, right? It’s a lot of volume, but it’s also end of year, end of season, and given the inflated cost basis, we’ve all been very careful about managing our inventory so it doesn’t dilute our margins too much. No one wants the inventory after the holiday.” “I’m hearing from retailers that Black Friday and Super Saturday were both good,” said John Neutzling, chief operating officer of Miller Capital Advisors. “They both showed increases over last year. However, what was more interesting is that the sales across the weeks of Black Friday and Super Saturday were better than last year also. So that suggests shoppers were showing up all week long.” The privately held Skokie, Ill.-based Miller Capital has 17 properties in its portfolio including large, high-profile shopping centers like Ala Moana in Honolulu, Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona and the Houston Galleria. “Some of the legacy brands, the ones that have been around for a while, seem to now appeal to Gen Z and even Gen Alpha. The Gap in particular has found a really good business plan, and has had multiple quarters of sales growth,” said Neutzling. John Harmon, a technology and equity analyst at Coresight, characterized the season as “just on track,” but could wind up being a bit better than 3 to 3.5 percent. Noting how people were shopping early, Harmon said October seemed “pretty calm, business really picked up in November, and 34.7 percent of consumers in the U.S. were done shopping by Dec. 15.” Regarding promotions, “It seemed pretty normal and largely planned.” Harmon listed Amazon, Walmart and Target as the top-performing retailers during the season, though Walmart was largely fueled by its superior food offering; Amazon by its popularity, speedy deliveries and low prices, and Target apparently experienced a pickup after several sluggish seasons. He also cited Dollar Tree, TJ Maxx, Dollar General, Costco and Kohl’s as having a good season. With holiday shopping spreading out over a longer period, Black Friday was less busy this year, with 46.8 percent of consumers shopping, versus 63.8 percent last year. Doorbusters were limited, and the Black Friday crowds of yesteryear were gone. “The season ended on a high note,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. “Super Saturday and the Sunday and Monday after were very strong days for retailers, in terms of foot traffic and buying. It’s also been an excellent year for apparel, which is well over 7 percent ahead. Apparel was a laggard for many years. But people have been out spending, perceptions of the economy are improving, and interest rates ticked down. The impact of tariffs has been overblown. We think that will all settle out. “The real thing that added money for spending was this dramatic drop in gasoline prices. We went into the season forecasting 4 to 4.6 percent sales growth. It might get up to 5 percent-plus” overall for the retail sector. Johnson, like other observers, cited Walmart, Costco, Amazon and off-price players as performing well this season. “It’s been a relatively benign promotional season, though there are always a few outliers, most retailers were 25 to 40 percent off, though Gap offered 40 percent off everything” in late December, he said. Industrywide, “Inventories were pretty much in balance, as the two months unfolded we saw people really beginning to spend.” The athleisure sector, including Vuori, Beyond Yoga and Free People Movement, were exceptionally strong, and retailers specializing in health and personal care had a good season. Demand for consumer electronics picked up, but mostly with video games. Outdoor sporting goods had just “a pretty good season.” Returns were in full swing starting Friday, as were post-Christmas sales, so Americans took the opportunity to exchange gifts for credit or take advantage of discounted merchandise. The combination of returning gifts and taking advantage of deepening discounts will continue for weeks, as will redeeming gift cards. For the holiday season, about 20 percent of apparel sold will be returned, according to Marcus Shen, CEO of B-stock, a business-to-business platform helping retailers unload returns and excess merchandise to off-pricers, jobbers and resale stores. The vast majority of apparel, he believes, will be back on the shelves and hangers. “Consumer electronics and some other categories outside of apparel are probably closer to the 10 to 15 percent range. It varies by brand and category.” Overall, he expects return rates to be a slightly above last year’s, mirroring how sales perform. While business has been so far so good, the Friday and weekend after Christmas brought significant weather volatility, impacting what’s normally a busy day in stores for returns and redeeming gift cards. In the Pacific Northwest, “Heavy precipitation and high winds are expected to persist through New Year’s Day,” Evan Gold, executive vice president of global partnership and alliances at Planalytics, which quantifies how weather impacts businesses, wrote in a report. “Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, Seattle and Portland are among the major markets to expect heavy precipitation, including 3-plus inches of rain over the coming days. This will bring flooding conditions and keep soils saturated. In addition, high winds are expected from Northern California into the Pacific Northwest, posing threats for power outages and causing travel disruptions.” Gold indicated that sales on the West Coast of need-based categories will spike, including wiper blades, rainwear and pumps. Major population centers, including New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore and Detroit, got hit with snow and ice over the weekend. New York City got over 4 inches of snow, its most in four years. Another storm, mainly rain with some ice, was expected to hit the Northeast late Sunday afternoon into early Monday morning. Gold wrote before the Saturday storm that it was likely to drive demand for need-based categories, including ice melt, snow shovels, scrapers, heaters and more, Gold wrote. However, unlike the days preceding Christmas, when consumers must get to the stores for last-minute gifts, shoppers could wait out the bad post-Christmas weather hitting the East Coast and California because stores typically allow 30 to 90 days to make returns and gift cards are generally good for years. Looking ahead to 2026, there will be a wave of tax refunds due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and he has proposed providing a onetime, $2,000 tariff rebate to Americans to offset some of the impact of tariffs and the anxiety over the economy to stimulate spending. Also, Trump has proposed $1,176 “warrior dividends” to military personnel. “From what we understand from the customer, there is enthusiasm” about the economic stimulus from the government, Yalof observed. “There is a lot money in the marketplace.” Yalof also said retailers he’s had contact with are “very optimistic” about 2026. “Retailers have not slowed down growth, from a leasing perspective. We’re doing a lot of brick-and-mortar deals.” Ohashi at Brooks Brothers said he believes the skies will be bright “as long as we continue to offer newness.” While half of the company’s stores are in the Northeast, he said Brooks will be focusing more on its warm-weather doors next year, even opening two stores in Puerto Rico in 2026. Stores in warmer climates move into spring more quickly, providing a quicker read on the season. Mitchell said he’s “a little cautious, especially in men’s where traffic slowed the last two weeks, but I’m still positive.” Giddon at Rothmans said he’s optimistic about 2026, and that the final days before Christmas “surprised us because we felt the economy wasn’t that strong. But people are obviously more optimistic so we’ll have to measure our projections slightly upward for 2026.” RetailNext tracks shopper traffic at hundreds of retailers outfitted with tens of thousands of RetailNext traffic counters. “For the season overall, traffic was down 6.5 percent from November through Super Saturday,” said Joe Shasteen, global manager, advanced analytics, Retail Next. Stores were getting fewer visits, but conversion rates held up. “The shopping this year was more intentional and less about browsing,” Shasteen said, adding that retailers made up shortfalls in their stores with their e-commerce businesses, which were up in the high single digits. “Holiday sales are not a reliable predictor, but we see a 5 percent-plus gain possibly repeated in the first quarter of 2026. It may even jump ahead of that, if we see a turn in the housing market,” said Johnson. “There are a couple of signs of that happening, but it’s not quite there yet. Housing has historically been a big booster to growth. If interest rates come down, we may yet see not just above 5, but 6 percent by the back half.” “All the indicators show we are going to have some positive business going into 2026,” Von Maur said. “The economy is still strong, unemployment is low, tariffs got the prices up but customers aren’t holding back.” With tariffs, “The worst is behind us.” “The holiday season has so far been a success for retailers,” Stephanie Cegielski, vice president, research and public relations, ICSC, said on Tuesday. “Consumers are still price-sensitive, but most continued to shop in the final days leading up to Christmas….One thing is clear: Despite their economic concerns, consumers are still willing to spend on memorable experiences, entertainment and gifts at the right price. They may be prioritizing value, but the retailers that are winning this holiday season will look beyond price to connect with consumers and stay on their radars into 2026 and beyond.” — With contributions from Jean E.

Instead, most of the biggest headlines attached to the financial services organization were irrelevant to trading screens, most notably the conclusion to its years-long battle with the SEC, major acquisitions to propel its future growth, and the launch of a billion-dollar stablecoin product—RLUSD. Below we’ll look back at the biggest highlights for XRP and Ripple in 2025. More than four years after it began, the legal dispute between Ripple Labs Inc. and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially came to a close in August. The landmark case, which investigated whether or not sales of XRP violated securities laws, extended back to December 2020. In 2023, a partial ruling favored Ripple Labs, but appeals and counter-appeals extended the saga into 2025. However, with the election of President Donald Trump and a crypto-friendlier regulatory administration, the pair opted to find a jointly negotiated resolution in early 2025. That negotiated resolution was later denied by a U.S. district judge, and then by the courts, so eventually the pair agreed to drop their respective appeals—ending the affair for good and cementing the 2023 ruling in Ripple’s favor as a precedent for future crypto classifications. Prior to 2025, XRP had last traded above $3.00 in 2018. Seven years later, and around a month before the conclusion to Ripple Labs’ yearslong legal battle with the SEC, the Ripple-linked XRP made a new all-time high of $3.65, according to data from CoinGecko, surging beyond its previous high mark of $3.40 from 2018. That made XRP the third-largest crypto asset by market capitalization at the time, trailing just Bitcoin and Ethereum. With regulatory scrutiny waning, analysts at the time told Decrypt that investors “believed in Ripple's vision for a regulatory-compliant blockchain for institutions.” Though its rapid rise placed the token in a range it had not seen since 2018, investment firms like Standard Chartered maintained even higher end-of-year price targets for XRP during the summer—expecting a move to $5.50 by the end of year. That mark seems unlikely now though, despite the acceleration of the tokenization trend that Standard Chartered highlighted as a potential catalyst for the price of XRP. XRP, now the fourth-largest asset by market capitalization, was changing hands at $1.90 as of December 15, around 48% off its July all-time high. After the approval and ensuing success of ETFs for crypto majors Bitcoin and Ethereum, both investors and fund issuers were eager to get altcoin ETFs—like those for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin—to market. As a result, applications for altcoin ETFs flooded the SEC, and by June, expert opinions predicted the likelihood of their approvals as a “near lock” for 2025. Those opinions were further validated in September when the SEC cleared a path to approval for new ETFs by signing off on new generic listing standards. Around that time, Rex Shares and Osprey Funds got their joint XRP ETF to market—an Act 40 ETF that follows different listing standards than other crypto ETFs. Demand for the product was shown immediately, grabbing $38 million in day one volume, good enough to mark the year’s biggest debut up until that point. Shortly thereafter, though, more traditional spot ETF products from Canary Capital, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton hit the market. In December, leveraged products hit the market as well, allowing investors to double their exposure to XRP’s gains. Since their launch, the spot ETFs have generated nearly $1 billion in net inflows without a single day of outflows, according to data from CoinGlass, as of December 15. XRP eclipsed a major milestone in 2025, but so did Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD. First launched in December 2024, the dollar-backed stablecoin frontran the growing trend of stablecoin products from other financial giants like Western Union and JP Morgan, and the passing of the GENIUS Act, which provided regulatory clarity on the issuance and trading of the fiat-backed tokens. In the year since its launch, functionality for RLUSD has expanded. In September it was added to Securitize’s tokenization platform, a BlackRock-backed platform that now allows users to exchange shares of tokenized money market funds for RLUSD. In December the firm earned approval to broaden payment services, including RLUSD, in Singapore as well. It's being used for credit card settlements too, thanks to a partnership with Mastercard and WebBank, the issuer of crypto exchange Gemini’s credit card products. While RLUSD is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, Ripple applied for a National Bank Charter in July, following the lead of USDC issuer Circle, as it aims to become the “benchmark for trust” in the stablecoin market. And it received conditional approval in December, alongside other stablecoin issuers. At the time of writing, the stablecoin has reached a $1.3 billion market cap, making it the 11th largest stablecoin in less than a year since its launch, according to data from DefiLlama. Though closely linked to XRP, Ripple is much larger and more expansive than a single crypto token, and its footprint grew considerably throughout 2025 thanks to major acquisitions. In April, the firm forked over $1.25 billion to acquire primer brokerage Hidden Road as it aimed to better serve institutional clients on a larger scale. It then spent another $1 billion to acquire treasury asset management firm GTreasury in October, in a play that will reduce friction and costs associated with legacy financial systems, according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. It surrounded that acquisition with two others, paying $200 million to add Toronto-based stablecoin platform Rail, and an undisclosed amount on wallet-as-a-service provider Palisade. All told, Ripple's acquisitions in 2025 maintain a similar theme, improving payment efficiencies while expanding its financial services offerings. Those moves helped the firm notch a $500 million investment in November, valuing it at $40 billion and cementing its place among the current and future leaders of the crypto industry. "This investment isn’t just validation of Ripple’s growth strategy and business built on the foundation of XRP, but also a clear bet on what the future of crypto will look like," Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on X. "I’m very proud of what we’ve built, and all that’s to come."

Nvidia invests $20 billion to license Groq's AI technology and hire its leadership. The deal is a strategic move to counter Google's growing influence in AI inference hardware. Structuring it as a licensing agreement aims to avoid intense antitrust scrutiny. Nvidia gains key talent from Google's TPU project to bolster its own chip development. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. The deal is a strategic move to counter Google's growing influence in AI inference hardware.

Nvidia gains key talent from Google's TPU project to bolster its own chip development. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. In a move that reshapes the battlefield of artificial intelligence hardware, chip giant Nvidia has strategically deployed a massive $20 billion to secure the technology and brains behind a key startup, Groq. This deal, structured as a licensing agreement and talent acquisition, represents Nvidia's largest such transaction ever and is a direct response to rising competition, particularly from Google's custom tensor processing units (TPUs). For those watching the high-stakes race for AI inference supremacy, this is a clear signal that the arms race is accelerating, with Nvidia pulling out its checkbook to maintain its edge. The agreement, announced just before the Christmas holiday, sees Nvidia licensing Groq's AI inference technology and hiring away its founder and CEO, Jonathan Ross, along with President Sunny Madra and other senior leaders. Ross is a pivotal figure, having previously helped launch Google's TPU project. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined the rationale in an internal email, stating, "We plan to integrate Groqâs low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A deal structured for scrutiny While publicly framed as a "non-exclusive licensing agreement," multiple reports confirm the total value approaches $20 billion in cash for Groq's assets. This complex structure is widely seen as a tactic to navigate intense antitrust scrutiny. Groq will continue to operate independently, at least in name, with its finance chief Simon Edwards becoming the new CEO. Its cloud service, GroqCloud, will also continue operating. As Huang noted, "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groqâs IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company." This "acqui-hire plus licensing" model has become a common playbook for Big Tech. Similar deals have been executed by Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia itself earlier this year. The approach allows giants to rapidly absorb innovative technology and top-tier talent without triggering the same level of regulatory review as a traditional acquisition. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon observed, "Antitrust would seem to be be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive." The Google factor and inference wars The strategic impetus for this massive expenditure is clear. Nvidia, while dominant in chips for training AI models, faces a growing challenge in the inference market, where trained models deliver answers to user queries. Google's custom TPUs have gained significant momentum here, offering an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Groq's specialty is its "language processing unit" chips, designed specifically for fast, efficient inference. By bringing Groq's technology and TPU-savvy leadership in-house, Nvidia is buying a shortcut to compete more directly with Google's in-house advances. This is a defensive and offensive move, ensuring its hardware remains the go-to choice as the AI industry's focus increasingly shifts from training models to deploying them at scale. The deal came together rapidly, reportedly just months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation in September. It is crucial to distinguish Groq from "Grok," the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI. The similar names are a coincidence, but this deal is purely about the underlying silicon that powers such AI applications. For investors who backed Groq's recent funding round, including firms like BlackRock and a fund where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner, the payoff is staggering: a tripling of their investment in roughly three months. This highlights the immense financial firepower Nvidia has accumulated, with more than $60 billion in cash on hand, and its willingness to spend it to consolidate power. The conclusion is unmistakable. In the relentless march of AI progress, control over the foundational hardware is paramount. Nvidia's historic $20 billion deal is not just a purchase of technology; it is an investment in maintaining sovereignty over the future of computation itself. As custom chips from tech giants and well-funded startups emerge, this move proves that even the market leader cannot afford to simply innovate; it must also strategically assimilate.

This highlights the immense financial firepower Nvidia has accumulated, with more than $60 billion in cash on hand, and its willingness to spend it to consolidate power. The conclusion is unmistakable. In the relentless march of AI progress, control over the foundational hardware is paramount.

Title: A 'jobless boom' is shaping up to be the story of the 2026 economy

The US economy continues to surprise on the upside — except when it comes to jobs. Hot growth, as seen in this week's GDP report, typically corresponds to stronger hiring and personal earnings, which then enable consumers to continue spending. However, this year, the trend has been the opposite. Spending is driving the economy, but the job market is stuck in a "Great Freeze." As KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk wrote on Tuesday, "Growth and labor market outcomes have decoupled." It's shaping up to be the story of 2026. The US has found itself in what some are calling a "jobless boom." Money is flowing in and out of the economy at a healthy clip, but it's not going toward creating a new job for you. Instead, all eyes are on artificial intelligence, investment in which drove much of the year's economic growth, along with still-strong consumer spending. The big AI investors were larger companies, including those that have led white-collar job cuts. In some cases, their profits have skyrocketed, and "do more with less" has been the mantra of the year. "Firms are doing more with fewer workers," Swonk wrote. "Many overshot on staffing during the hiring frenzy and are now using attrition or layoffs to bring staffing levels more in line with demand. Others are offsetting the squeeze on profit margins due to tariffs with layoffs and hiring freezes." Economists are still grappling with how the US ended up in this rare scenario. This year, although overall layoffs have crept up, they remain relatively low. Corporate America and Big Tech were the exceptions, with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla announcing big cuts. Business Insider has heard from dozens of white-collar job seekers who said that finding a new role has felt "impossible," and those with jobs have, in many cases, held onto them for dear life. In addition to a tough job market, consumers had no income growth last quarter. However, spending held strong — despite tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. A large percentage of this spending uptick was in healthcare and medical services, as costs for hospital and nursing services climbed. This year marks the most Americans have spent on healthcare services since 2022, when the Omicron wave of COVID-19 spread. This suggests that, despite strong spending by affluent households, much of this rise in consumer spending wasn't necessarily powered by confidence. In fact, consumer sentiment levels are among the lowest they have ever been, and many Americans have been cautious about spending because of tariff uncertainty. The tough job market isn't helping. Unemployment is at 4.6%, the highest since 2021. Total job growth has stayed slow. Dozens of job seekers across generations told Business Insider this year that they were frustrated about suspected ageism, cumbersome hiring processes, competition with hundreds of others for a single role, and the suspected role of AI in screening out their applications. Some told reporters they've applied for thousands of roles with no interviews, while others said it took well over a year to get a single offer, often at a lower pay than their previous job. In his 2026 wish list for the business world, Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco asked for "ROI for AI." "I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects," he wrote, referring to the eye-popping AI spending from Big Tech — and their plans for even more next year. If that does come, the jobless boom may only grow. Companies want to use AI to boost productivity without hiring more people, which would only exacerbate a sluggish job market. Although it's difficult to determine if this year's investments in AI have yielded results, the GDP's spike to 4.3% in the third quarter is an encouraging sign overall. The largest growth since the third quarter of 2023 prompted President Donald Trump to say that the "Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead." Still, many Americans may worry about what this means for their jobs. Some companies have cited the need to be efficient in an AI-driven future as justification for layoffs. The US already operates with fewer jobs than it had pre-COVID, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has recently said that the grim jobs data may be overstating this year's deflated gains. Jump to

Title: India Inc 2026: Hinterland hiring, gig growth and AI disruption

Dear reader, as 2025, a year of global tumult and volatility, rolls by, Mint's reporters and columnists look around the corner on what is coming in 2026—to help you know what to expect and prepare for it. Tell us what you think at feedback@livemint.com. The Chinese zodiac predicts that 2026 will be the Year of the Fire Horse, symbolizing bold decisions, ambition and sharply moving away from the strategic thinking that was 2025, the Year of the Wood Snake. For both the employer and the employee in India Inc, there will be three prominent trends, says experts. The spotlight will shift to smaller cities and towns as companies look for the right talent and metros lose their lure. The second change will be the dominant role that the gig workforce will play. Thirdly, the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) will remain an integral aspect of the workplace in the coming year with concerns on how to upskill employees without letting go of the high performers. About 18 months ago, recruitment firm CIEL HR opened a hiring hub in Patna where 25 recruiters scout for talent from neighbouring Chhattisgarh and Odisha states and the smaller towns of Bihar. The aim was to cater to the hiring needs of retail, financial services, consumer goods, and manufacturing clients. A similar hub was created earlier in Mysuru in Karnataka as well to tap into IT talent. “The demand from smaller towns will grow because the total cost of hiring and retaining an employee is 5-10% lower in the longer run for companies as those who migrate can be held onto for a longer period than those who are from the larger metros with their offices and homes in the same city,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, managing director and chief executive officer of CIEL HR. The total cost of hiring denotes the overall financial implications of an employee during one's tenure. In this case, it will include investments in upskilling the employee and how their productivity impacts the firm. Mishra pointed out that companies have started employing a blended workforce where a major chunk will be from the same city, 20-25% from nearby towns and the rest from other states. This is largely in the case of temporary staffing, where the employee works at the client's site but will be on the payrolls of the vendor. Over the past couple of years, staffing firms found it difficult to get workers for the peak sale period (August-December) as the workforce demanded higher wages for relocation to the larger cities. A similar challenge will continue in the coming year. Cost pressures on companies will force more gig hiring across the skillset spectrum. Until now, the spurt in gig hiring would come on the back of festive season recruitment, but with the implementation of the labour codes, the benefits for gig workers are cemented. Online food delivery, e-commerce and quick-commerce companies will now have to allocate up to 2% of their annual turnover for the welfare of gig and platform workers. In November, the ministry of labour and employment announced that with the new reforms, all workers would get benefits such as retirement savings via provident fund, coverage under the Employees' State Insurance Corporation, other insurance and social security benefits. Therefore, there will be a larger number of the informal workforce aiming to enter the gig economy. While on a vendor's payroll, gig workers take up short-term projects that could be for a few hours or days and they can work across platforms. Dark stores, retail and logistics are some of the segments that hire gig workers on a large scale. The country’s gig workforce is projected to grow from 10 million in 2024-25 to 23.5 million by 2029-30, according to a Press Information Bureau note on 30 August. "Gig will continue to grow in scale as more people will be eager to join this workforce after new labour codes giving them the social security cover along with blue collar and even white-collar gig roles will scale up," said Lohit Bhatia, CEO-designate for Quess Corp. Blue-collared workers are typically employed in the automotive and manufacturing sector while white-collared find a job in services. In 2025, companies including Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta retrenched employees, citing AI. Companies are in a flux as they scamper to upskill employees on the latest in technology. They are hiring candidates who have the prowess on AI and at the same time, letting go of those who are in the bottom rung of the skillsets. There is a stress that has built up across industries and will play out in the coming year as well. "I do not expect AI’s impact on workplaces to stabilize or 'calm down' after the layoffs we saw in 2025. The 2025 layoffs were not only about cost-cutting – they were about restructuring work around AI systems. In 2026, in my view, that process will deepen," said Rohini Lakshane, a technologist and researcher. Lakshane said companies will have to take note of how they inform and discuss with their workforce the changes in profiles because of AI. “Jobs will not vanish in waves, but they will be hollowed out, with fewer people doing more work, assisted and monitored by AI. Tasks within roles will be automated, recombined or shifted. If that is done without clear communication to workers, it creates insecurity even when employment technically continues," Lakshane said. With increased automation, the pressure on employees will go up as well. "Workers who can design, audit or manage AI systems will remain in demand. For highly skilled professionals, especially in technology and analytics, 2026 will look calmer on the surface, but expectations might rise sharply. Fewer people doing more work, assisted by AI tools, with thinner margins for error," said Lakshane. Ironically, India Inc is one of the swiftest to adopt AI in its teams. According to an EY report covering 50 employers and 800 employees, about 62% use GenAI at work regularly, whereas 90% of the employers and 86% of the employees believe that AI impacts productivity positively. The study noted that 75% of the employees and 72% of the employers believe that GenAI enhances decision making, 82% of the employees and 92% of the employers believe it positively impacts the quality of work.

Title: Bitcoin whales move $230mln to exchanges, yet BTC holds range – Why?

Time Published: 2025-12-26T00:00:33Z

Big wallets moved Bitcoin to exchanges, but price hesitation left traders questioning the next move. Bitcoin’s muted price action, paired with renewed whale activity, unsettled market sentiment on the 25th of December. On that day, a long-dormant Bitcoin whale and asset manager BlackRock transferred large BTC amounts to exchanges, according to Onchain Lens. Onchain Lens reported that BlackRock deposited 2,292 Bitcoin [BTC], worth $199.8 million, into Coinbase. Separately, a whale wallet dormant for eight years deposited 400 BTC, valued at $34.92 million, into OKX. Large holders often shape short-term sentiment, as traders monitor such transfers for potential sell-side pressure. That dynamic left market participants cautious, even without immediate confirmation of spot selling. On top of that, U.S. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds extended their losing streak. SoSoValue data showed Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded five consecutive days of net outflows. Source: SoSoValue That pattern suggested institutional demand remained fragile despite Bitcoin holding above key technical support. Together, ETF outflows and exchange deposits reinforced a defensive market tone. At press time, Bitcoin traded near $87,700, down roughly 0.35% on the day. During the same period, Open Interest fell 0.99% to $57.42 billion, reflecting reduced leverage exposure. That decline signaled traders unwound risk rather than positioning aggressively for a breakout. Even so, intraday positioning hinted at localized bullish conviction. Source: CoinGlass According to CoinGlass’ Liquidation Map, major leverage clusters sat near $85,966 below price and $88,636 above. At these levels, intraday traders have built $646.17 million worth of long-leveraged positions and $422.42 million worth of short-leveraged positions. This suggests that traders were tilted toward the bullish side and strongly believe that BTC’s price will not fall below the $85,966 level. AMBCrypto’s technical analysis on the weekly chart revealed that BTC has been in a tight consolidation zone between the $86,000 and $93,500 levels since the 17th of November. Historically, consolidation breakouts or breakdowns lead to major rallies or declines, and as BTC’s price approaches the lower boundary, it has sparked fear of a potential breakdown below this range. Source: TradingView Based on the price action, if sentiment remains unchanged and BTC breaks below the key support at $86,000 with a daily candle close beneath it, it could open the door to a massive downside move. However, the bearish outlook would only be invalidated if BTC breaks out above the upper boundary at the $93,500 level.

Since the start of January, the overall U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin supply has increased by more than $100 billion, to $314 billion total. But that doesn’t mean all boats have risen at the same rate. To measure stablecoin performance, Decrypt calculated velocity using historical data from crypto price aggregator CoinGecko from January through December 15. Velocity divides total volume by average supply, resulting in a calculation of how many times each coin has, on average, changed hands. As former Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chairman Timothy Massad explained to Decrypt, measuring velocity beats rankings that rely only on total supply. “Stablecoins can be very useful without there being a large market cap,” he said. “In other words, it's really the velocity, the transaction use, and they can circulate very quickly even if the amount outstanding is not that great.” Tether tops the list with a velocity of 166 because it’s long been a workhorse for global crypto trading. It can’t claim the crown as the first-ever stablecoin—that belongs to BitUSD. But it launched the same year, in 2014, and became the first widely used one. Tether boasts a market capitalization of $186 billion after increasing 35% since the start of the year, according to CoinGecko data. The bulk of Tether tokens get traded on Ethereum (46.3%) and Tron (41.4%), according to DeFi Llama data. Tether began the year by relocating to Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele declared BTC legal tender in 2021. There have been a few bumps, though. In March, Binance said it would delist USDT for European Union users to stay compliant with MiCA regulations, which require stablecoin issuers to be licensed. But that’s not stopped the company from turning a hefty profit. So far in 2025, Tether has seen $10 billion in profit in the first three quarters of the year, the company said in October. Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD, swiped the second spot with a velocity of 71. That means, on average, every RLUSD token has changed hands 71 times since the start of the year. In most stablecoin lineups, Circle’s USDC would hold this spot because its $78 billion market capitalization trumps that of RLUSD’s $1.3 billion. But as Massad pointed out, stablecoin performance has more to do with being able to move money efficiently than its total supply. Ripple was provisionally approved for a national banking charter by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, in December. “This is a massive step forward—first for RLUSD— setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal (OCC) & state (NYDFS) oversight,” Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on X. HUGE news! @Ripple just received conditional approval from the @USOCC to charter Ripple National Trust Bank. This is a massive step forward - first for $RLUSD, setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal (OCC) & state (NYDFS) oversight. To the… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 12, 2025 Ripple Senior Vice President of Stablecoins Jack McDonald has often pointed out that RLUSD was specifically designed for institutional use. At the start of December, Ripple got the green light from the Singapore Monetary Authority, or MAS, to expand XRP and RLUSD payments in Singapore. And earlier this year, RLUSD was integrated into Securitize's tokenization platform. That means it’s one of the assets investors can swap for tokenized money market funds. USDC saw its velocity reach 56 in 2025, while its market capitalization climbed 78% to $78.4 billion by December 15. Perhaps more than any of its competitors, Circle benefitted massively from the passage of the GENIUS Act. Its operating model already resembled the federally regulated framework that’s now become U.S. law. That’s given Circle a head start on compliance and investor confidence—and investors took note. CRCL was so popular with investors on its debut that the NYSE halted trading three times. Since then, Circle has reported $740 million in Q3 revenue, marking a 66% year-over-year increase. Circle has also rolled out the testnet for Arc, its layer-1 blockchain, which counts BlackRock, Visa, and Amazon Web Services as early participants. Circle was also one of several stablecoin issuers—including Ripple, Paxos and BitGo—which got a provisional approval for its national banking charter and will be looking to expand into broader financial services. USD1 is an outlier because it launched in April, and therefore doesn’t have nearly a full year’s worth of data. But that didn’t stop it from landing right next to the podium with a velocity of 39. Issued by World Liberty Financial—the crypto-focused firm co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and partners—USD1 was designed from the outset to be a highly liquid transactional stablecoin. The token reached a $1 billion market cap in April, less than a month after its launch, according to data from CoinGecko. There have been some very bullish predictions about its growth. Blockstreet’s Kyle Klemmer told Decrypt he believes USD1 will be the world’s dominant stablecoin, beating USDT and USDC, before President Donald Trump’s second term ends in 2029. The project has leaned heavily on retail distribution and promotional partnerships, including integrations with several U.S.-based crypto exchanges, like Coinbase and FalconX, and it’s making a bid to become “Solana’s go-to stablecoin” by teaming up with meme coin platform Bonk and decentralized exchange Raydium. PayPal USD’s velocity of 18 lands it in fifth place on this list. Its 2023 debut made big waves because it was the first time an established payments platform made a bid at issuing a stablecoin—years before there was a regulatory framework in the U.S.. For most of this year, growth for PYUSD moved at a modest pace. Its market capitalization peaked above $1 billion in June and then established a foothold in September. Since then, it’s nearly tripled to $3.8 billion as of December 15. PayPal has teamed with LayerZero to expand the token’s presence to nine new blockchains, including Tron, Abstract, Aptos, and Avalanche. But there’s also been some controversy. In October, observers noted that PYUSD issuer Paxos minted and then immediately burned $300 trillion worth of tokens. It’s an impossibly large number of tokens, given it represents more than twice the world’s GDP. At 3:12 PM EST, Paxos mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer. Paxos immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD. This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach. Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root… — Paxos (@Paxos) October 15, 2025 "This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach,” the firm wrote on X. “Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root cause." Ethena Labs’ USDe demonstrated a velocity of 11 in 2025, with its market capitalization showing a modest gain of 11% from $5.8 billion in January to $6.5 billion by December 15. But that trajectory leaves out the fact that its market cap soared to nearly $15 billion before the early October flash crash. USDe is the only stablecoin on this list that isn’t backed by fiat currency: It’s backed by a delta-neutral strategy involving staked Ethereum and perpetual futures hedges. But its reliance on derivatives means that times of high volatility and shifts in sentiment can cause big swings in market capitalization. Even with a less straightforward structure, the token’s advocates include billionaire Arthur Hayes. But not all regulators are convinced. Ethena Labs pulled out of the German market in April over growing scrutiny over its “serious deficiencies” in compliance. Sky’s USDS showed extremely low velocity of 1 in 2025—and that’s by design. To avoid confusion: Sky is a rebrand of DeFi OG MakerDAO and USDS is a rebrand of its DAI stablecoin. Unlike USDT or USDC, which function as transactional stablecoins, most USDS tokens sit locked in Maker vaults or savings contracts as collateral for DeFi loans rather than circulating. Its role in DeFi is closer to a yield-bearing savings instrument than digital cash, so it naturally turns over far less often. For example, the Sky Protocol currently offers a 4% rewards rate (paid in SKY tokens) to users who hold USDS. As of 2025, USDS has seen its market capitalization grow from $5.2 billion at the start of the year to $9.8 billion, marking an 85% increase in just under 12 months.

Title: Why Are Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Crashing Again?

Time Published: 2025-12-25T18:30:25Z
Full Content:
The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are crashing again, with the crypto market failing to record a ‘Santa rally’ like other major assets. This comes as BTC and ETH continue to face significant selling pressure from the crypto ETFs, which are facing sustained outflows. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down again amid selling pressure from the BTC and ETH ETFs. According to Arkham data, BlackRock deposited 2,292 BTC ($200 million) and 9,976 ETH ($29 million) into Coinbase yesterday, likely to sell these coins. This marked the second time this week that the world’s largest asset manager had sent BTC and ETH to Coinbase in a bid to offload these coins. Further data from Arkham shows that BlackRock deposited 2,838.78 Bitcoin ($255 million) and 29,928 Ethereum ($91.29 million) into Coinbase on December 22. These sell-offs come as the crypto ETFs continue to record significant outflows. The BTC ETFs have seen a total net outflow of $330 million this week, while the ETH ETFs have a weekly net outflow of $11 million. This indicates that the institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum is fading at the moment, which provides a bearish outlook for the largest crypto assets by market cap. A CoinShares report released earlier this week revealed that Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of $460 million last week, while Ethereum ETPs saw outflows of $555 million. From a macro perspective, the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have also continued to decline as the Fed looks unlikely to cut interest rates at the January FOMC meeting. The recent U.S. GDP and jobless claims reports have sparked a surge in the odds that the Fed will hold rates steady next month. A CryptoQuant analysis revealed that the bear market risk is becoming more relevant based on the Bitcoin Combined Market Index (BCMI). The BCMI is said to be below equilibrium at the moment but well above historical bottom zones. This suggests that there is still more room for the BTC price to drop to the downside. The CryptoQuant analysis stated that from a data-driven perspective, this opens the possibility that Bitcoin is transitioning into a bear phase and not just experiencing a pullback. If history repeats itself, BTC is expected to form a more durable bottom if the BCMI revisits the 2019 to 2023 levels. The analysis added that this is a scenario worth considering, as at this stage, the market appears to be in a downward transition rather than a completed reset.

Title: How to Stay Ahead of AI as an Early-Career Engineer
URL: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-effect-entry-level-jobs
Time Published: 2025-12-25T17:00:02Z
Full Content:
As AI takes on more work, expectations for entry-level roles grow “AI is not going to take your job. The person who uses AI is going to take your job.” This is an idea that has become a refrain for, among others, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has publicly made the prediction several times since October 2023. Meanwhile, other AI developers and stalwarts say the technology will eliminate countless entry-level jobs. These predictions have come at the same time as reports of layoffs at companies including IBM and Amazon, causing anxiety for tech workers—especially those starting their careers, whose responsibilities are often more easily automated. Early reports have borne out some of these anxieties in employment data. For example, entry-level hiring at the 15 biggest tech firms fell 25 percent from 2023 to 2024, according to a report from SignalFire last May. Still, it’s unclear what the long-term effects will be, or whether hiring cuts are actually a result of AI. For instance, while Meta laid off 600 employees from its AI division in October (and continued hiring other AI researchers), OpenAI began hiring junior software engineers. This article is part of our special report Top Tech 2026. In 2026, all new graduates may face a tougher job market in the United States. Employers’ rating of the job market for college graduates is now at its most pessimistic since 2020, according to data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Job Outlook 2026 survey. However, 49 percent of respondents still consider the job market “good” or “very good.” So, what does the rise of generative AI mean for early-career engineers? “This is a tectonic shift,” says Hugo Malan, president of the science, engineering, technology and telecom reporting unit within the staffing agency Kelly Services. AI agents aren’t poised to replace workers one-to-one, though. Instead, there will be a realignment of which jobs are needed, and what those roles look like. When publicly available AI tools first arrived, Malan says the expectation was that jobs like call-center roles would be most vulnerable. “But what nobody predicted was that the biggest impact by far would be on programmers,” a trend he attributes to the relatively solitary and highly structured nature of the work. He notes that, while other economic conditions also factor into the job market, the pace of programmer employment decline has accelerated since generative AI came on the scene. In the United States, overall programmer employment fell a dramatic 27.5 percent between 2023 and 2025, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics. But employment for software developers—a distinct, more design-oriented position in the government data—only fell 0.3 percent in the same period. At the same time, some positions, such as information security analyst and AI engineer are actually growing, Malan says. “There’s been this pretty dramatic readjustment of the job landscape, even with as narrow a field as IT. Within IT, some jobs have exploded, like InfoSec analysts have grown in double digits, whereas programmers declined double digits” over the past few years, he says. (Eventually, Malan says he expects generative AI to affect all intellectual work.) Job responsibilities also appear to be changing. For recent graduates pursuing roles labeled as software-engineering jobs, “they’re not necessarily just coding,” says Jamie Grant, senior associate director for the engineering team at the University of Pennsylvania’s career services. “There tends to be so much higher-order thinking and knowledge of the software-development life cycle,” as well as a need to work with other parties, such as understanding user and client demands, she says. In her work advising Penn students, Grant hears concerns about AI’s effects on the job market from many engineering students and their parents. But during conversations with them, she says she tries to maintain an ethos of “we can make this work for us, not against us.” According to a report from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, jobs involving tasks that could be automated with AI appear to be more susceptible to early-career employment dips than those where AI augments an employee’s ability to perform their job. The NACE data supports this: Sixty-one percent of employers say they are not replacing entry-level jobs with AI, while 41 percent are discussing or planning to augment these jobs with AI within the next five years. Over the past few years, computer-programmer employment in the United States has dropped sharply—but overall employment in the computing industry hasn’t seen the same decline. “Think about an exoskeleton that you could wear that allows you to lift 1,000 pounds,” Grant says. “AI should be, just as the people at Stanford say, an augmentation to your work, to your higher-order critical-thinking skills.” That being said, she advises students to be cautious of the risks, such as sharing sensitive or proprietary information with a chatbot. At this point, Grant thinks proficiency with AI tools is an unwritten expectation of many employers. But students and early-career workers should also recognize where AI can’t help. “AI can’t necessarily be with you in that moment of negotiation or of client-relationship development,” she says. “You still need to be able to perform at your highest level of capabilities.” And foundational skills like problem solving and communication are consistently prioritized by employers. With AI tools performing more of the “grunt work” that has served as a training ground for early-career workers, expectations for recent graduates are high. In the past, junior engineers have cultivated proficiency while doing simpler, more task-oriented work. “But if all of those are going to get taken over, you need to slot in at a higher level almost from day one,” Malan says. This leaves recent graduates in a difficult spot. To help students prepare, the education system will likely need to change, for instance by encouraging students to become proficient using AI and take on more hands-on, experiential learning. Today’s employers are looking for demonstrated skills, says Grant. “If you’re just going to class and doing projects and maybe getting a great GPA, that’s amazing. But you also need to be applying what you’re learning,” she says. Industry experience and demonstrated proficiencies are among the top factors considered by employers surveyed in NACE’s Job Outlook 2026. One solution may even lie in entirely different educational models, like apprenticeship. “Often, students in a more traditional computer-software degree program get a lot of theoretical knowledge,” but they may not have much experience building software on a team, says Mike Roberts, founder and CEO of the nonprofit Creating Coding Careers. Recent graduates may not be ready to ship code on day one—but AI can. Apprenticeship allows students to learn on the job in a structured program, and helps “to much more effectively close the experience gap,” Roberts says. Training the next generation of humans might also better serve the long-term interests of employers, he says. In today’s software engineering, many companies tend to be short-sighted in their hiring, thinking more of the next quarter than four or five years down the line. But “if you don’t train new early entrants into the market, you will eventually have no more people becoming mid-levels,” says Roberts. “It’s very myopic.” Also, AI can help ramp up new employees faster than ever. “I find it an exciting time, because it’s never been faster to build high-quality software,” Roberts says. “But it’s weird that folks are not seeing the virtue of continuing to invest in humans.” Gwendolyn Rak is an assistant editor at IEEE Spectrum covering consumer electronics and careers. She holds a master’s degree in science journalism from New York University and a bachelor’s degree in astrophysics and history from Swarthmore College.

Title: Top 10 SaaStr AI Predictions for 2026
URL: https://www.saastr.com/top-10-saastr-ai-predictions-for-2026/
Time Published: 2025-12-25T16:10:30Z
Full Content:
by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai So we decided to do something fun this year and write up our 2026 predictions together with every single SaaStr speaker and AI post of the year! How? Every single SaaStr AI session, interview and speaker was ingested into Claude so we worked the Top 10 for 2026 up … together. Our Top 10 Predictions for B2B + AI for 2026: The Prediction: AI-native B2B companies will run sales teams that are 50% smaller than their predecessors while maintaining or increasing revenue. The Evidence: At SaaStr, we’re already seeing this play out. We deployed an AI BDR that created 25% of our new pipeline in just 90 days. One leading AI dev tools company just closed a $4M+ annual deal where the Sales Engineer ran the entire relationship—the sales team’s only contribution was helping price the deal. What the data shows: The shift: The traditional “WFH mid-pack inside sales rep” faces extinction. The survivors will be: Sources: ICONIQ Growth GTM Benchmarking Study 2025; SaaStr AI Agent Deployment Data; Replit Head of Sales Engineering (conversation); SaaStr internal pipeline data The Prediction: The highest-performing B2B companies will have AI agents handling 40-60% of initial prospect and customer interactions by the end of the year. or at least on that path. The Evidence: At SaaStr, we now have more AIs than humans. We deployed 20+ agents across outbound sales, inbound, support, and operations—generating over $1M in direct revenue and handling 15,000+ messages in 100 days with 5-7% response rates (vs. 2-4% industry average). What’s working: The reality check: This isn’t “set and forget.” Managing agents now consumes 30% of our Chief AI Officer’s time. But the companies that figure this out in 2025 will have a massive operational advantage by 2026. As Wade Foster (CEO, Zapier) puts it: “The agent is basically doing 90 plus percent of the work and leaves the last mile to the account rep to make it happen.” That’s the hybrid model that works—AI for volume, humans for the critical last mile. Sources: SaaStr AI Agent Playbook (saastr.com); Amélie Lerutte, Chief AI Officer at SaaStr; Wade Foster, CEO Zapier; Qualified AI deployment data; Artisan campaign metrics The Prediction: By end of 2026, the majority of internal business applications and MVPs will be built through natural language prompts rather than traditional development. Not necessarily for production-grade apps, but everything up to that point. The Evidence: The numbers are unprecedented: I’ve personally built 9+ production apps on Replit with 750,000+ total uses, including financial modeling tools, content systems, and startup simulation games—all without writing traditional code. The breakthrough: After 100+ days of “vibe coding,” I achieved what I call “Replit Fluency”—the ability to see any app I want to build in my head and know exactly how to prompt it to production. This state is reachable by anyone willing to invest the learning curve. The market size: Based on current trajectories, the vibe coding TAM could reach $150-400B by 2030. Sources: Lovable founder Anton Osika (revenue announcement); Cursor revenue data (multiple sources); Replit Agent experience; Jason Lemkin direct experience with 9 production apps on Replit From Zero to Replit Fluent: How 9 Apps and 500,000 Users Taught Me to How to ‘Vibe’ Apps Into Production The Prediction: “Pretty good” SaaS companies ($20-100M ARR, 25-40% growth) will find themselves in no-man’s land with no clear path to exit. The Evidence: The math is brutal: From 2012-2023, nearly every SaaStr Fund portfolio company crossing $20M ARR with solid fundamentals received multiple PE offers. That’s not happening anymore. The middle-tier SaaS companies are stuck. What to do: Get profitable, optimize for cash flow over ARR growth, extend runway to 2026-2027, and focus on fundamentals (NRR >100%, gross margins >75%, Rule of 40+). Sources: ICONIQ venture data; SaaStr Fund I portfolio experience; Meritech Capital SaaStr Annual presentation; PE deal data (Thoma Bravo, Vista Equity, Clearlake) The Prediction: Leading AI companies will achieve 65-75% gross margins, fundamentally changing the “AI is expensive” narrative. The Evidence: OpenAI’s compute margin hit 70% in October 2025—up from 35% in January 2024. They doubled margin efficiency in less than two years. What’s driving it: The catch for startups: Competition raises the bar as fast as costs fall. One SaaStr Fund portfolio company at $100M ARR is adding $6M in inference costs next year—not because their product is broken, but to leapfrog competition. The treadmill never stops. Have AI Gross Margins Really Turned the Corner? The Real Math Behind OpenAI’s 70% Compute Margin — And Why B2B Startups Are Still Running on a Treadmill Sources: OpenAI compute margin data (The Information); Token cost analysis; SaaStr Fund portfolio company data; Mary Meeker AI Report The Prediction: Companies will transform support from a $2M cost center to a $500K profit center using AI agents. The Evidence: Gorgias deployed AI customer service to 500+ brands achieving: Their AI agents now handle 2.4 million automated interactions monthly, charging $1 per interaction while spending ~$0.22-0.23 on LLM costs. The bigger opportunity: The Shopping Assistant is driving 3-8% sales lift for merchants. Stores are choosing to keep AI live full-time instead of staffing human chat. Support is becoming a revenue driver. What’s required: Sources: Gorgias AI deployment data; Gorgias “30 in 30” program; Qualified AI support metrics; Intercom Fin deployment results (Paul Adams, CPO) The Prediction: Most AI companies will shift from pure seat-based pricing to token markup or hybrid models with seats + inference. The Evidence: Cursor’s pricing backlash exposed a fundamental problem: 5% of power users can consume 80% of compute costs, making per-seat pricing unsustainable. The new models emerging: Why this is inevitable: The industry shift: When your entire business model depends on marking up someone else’s tokens, you’re vulnerable to upstream pricing decisions. The sustainable companies will build genuine software value on top. Sources: Cursor pricing analysis; Jared Palmer (Vercel) on model costs; Oscar Le (token markup thesis); SaaS pricing research The Prediction: Multiple $50B+ IPOs from AI and AI-native companies, dwarfing 2021. The candidates: What’s different from 2021: The math: Databricks at $5B ARR growing 55% could command $80-100B. Anthropic could be the largest tech IPO ever. If it doesn’t go out in 2026, Stripe might be #1. Sources: Databricks financial data; Stripe revenue reports; Ramp growth data; Rippling product expansion; IPO market analysis The Prediction: The efficiency gap between AI-native and traditional companies will become insurmountable. The Evidence: At SaaStr: We now run an eight-figure business with single-digit headcount and 20+ AI agents. We went from 20+ human employees to 3 humans plus 20+ agents while maintaining revenue scale. What this means for hiring: The competitive implication: When your competitor operates with 30% fewer GTM headcount and 40% better unit economics, that’s not a sustainable disadvantage. Sources: Cursor employee data; Bessemer State of AI 2025 (AI Supernovas vs. Shooting Stars); SaaStr operational data; Lovable team size The Prediction: Either OpenAI or Anthropic will reach $1 trillion valuation by end of 2026. The Evidence: As Rory O’Driscoll noted in the 20VC year-end review: Anthropic’s “growth rate is faster than OpenAI, valuation convergence even after OpenAI’s potential new round at $800B… Dario’s cranked out the ‘I’m going to get profitable, I’m going to be sensible.’ If you own those stocks at the start of the year, this is the stock you’d feel most excited about.” What gets them there: The wild card: At least one major AI company may have a significant down round. Private market valuations are unsustainable for many players. Sources: OpenAI revenue data (The Information); Anthropic valuation reports; Mary Meeker/Bond Capital AI Trends Report; ChatGPT usage metrics Every one of these predictions points to the same conclusion: This technology cycle is moving faster than anything in human history. The companies that adapt quickest will capture disproportionate value. Those that wait for “certainty” will find themselves competing against AI-native challengers with 10x productivity advantages. You know this. The question isn’t whether AI will transform your business—it’s whether you’ll lead that transformation or be disrupted by it. 2025 was your very last chance to mostly … watch. And maybe just launch a co-pilot.

Title: Crypto sentiment is trapped in extreme fear because the industry’s biggest structural wins are failing to move prices
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-2025-sentiment-collapse-performance-gap/
Time Published: 2025-12-25T15:30:52Z

Investors won the policy battles, the regulatory clarity, and the institutional access they wanted. Bitcoin still dropped 30% and looks to finish the year negative. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto sentiment gauges have spent the past two months deep in the red. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has spent more than 30% of 2025 in fear or extreme fear territory, and alternative trackers put the market in a 10-25 range out of 100 since mid-November. Bitcoin is on track for its worst fourth quarter since 2018, many large altcoins are down up to 90% from their highs, and gold, silver, and major stock indices pushed to new highs in the same period. The mood is poisonous. Investors got all of the macro, the policy, the structural wins they'd been lobbying for since 2021, and the reward was a market that faded every rally and underperformed every competing asset class. That's not how cycles are supposed to end. It's how trust collapses, and narratives break. Understanding why sentiment cratered requires unpacking five overlapping drivers: performance versus expectations, thinning liquidity, brutal leverage washouts, confusing macro conditions, and narrative fatigue that turned bullish milestones into sell-the-news traps. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $126,000 in October, with a setup that looked clean: spot ETFs drew record inflows, the US government shutdown sparked a safe-haven narrative, and a third rate cut was set. Yet, instead of the parabolic fourth quarter many anticipated, Bitcoin dropped 30% and is finishing the year down single digits, marking its worst fourth quarter since 2018. Bitcoin faces record institutional demand and macroeconomic uncertainty, key drivers converging to push it to new highs. Altcoins fared worse, down up to 90% from their highs, wiped out by thin liquidity and the realization that most tokens launched between 2024 and 2025 had no product-market fit beyond speculation. The divergence with traditional assets only compounded the pain. Gold gained 70%, silver rallied 143%, and the S&P 500 pushed to new highs. Crypto investors watched their portfolios bleed while every other “debasement hedge” printed gains. That divergence creates a specific kind of sentiment poison: the feeling that you got the thesis right but chose the wrong instrument, or worse, that the asset class is broken. When performance lags expectations by that margin, and the setup looks perfect, sentiment doesn't soften; it collapses. On-chain data shows Bitcoin transaction volumes and active addresses trending down since November, with daily volume down sharply and activity falling by double digits. VanEck's mid-December chain report flagged weak fees, stagnant new addresses, and soft hash-rate growth. Derivatives and futures volumes have been sliding since late August, and multiple trading desks describe “weak buying pressure” around the $87,000-$90,000 band. When prices chop lower on declining volume, it signals that buyers have stepped away. Bitcoin tested support repeatedly, failed to reclaim higher levels, and each failed bounce reinforced the perception that the market had no conviction. With 2025 marking drastic valuation drop-offs, token launch strategies face scrutiny for prioritizing unicorn dreams over practical fundamentals. Thinning liquidity also amplifies downside volatility. Without deep bids, small sell orders gap the market lower, triggering stop-losses and liquidations that feed the fear gauges. The decline in active addresses suggests retail is exiting. Institutions provide capital but not the speculative energy that drives crypto's upside volatility. When retail leaves, the market becomes a battle between levered traders and long-term holders, with neither willing to chase prices higher. That produces the grinding, low-volume selloff that defined the fourth quarter. The November crash combined profit-taking above $100,000, ETF outflows, and an estimated $20 billion leverage flush in October. Long-dormant “OG” wallets moved and sold hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin into strength, which many read as “smart money top-ticking the cycle.” The leverage flush was mechanical: Bitcoin rallied above $120,000, open interest hit records, funding rates spiked, and the market overheated. When Bitcoin failed to break higher and started selling off, liquidations cascaded. Longs turned into forced sellers, stop-losses triggered, and the structure unwound in days. That kind of forced selling doesn't just move prices; it breaks sentiment. The long-term holder distribution added psychological damage. When wallets that haven't moved in years suddenly activate and sell, the market interprets it as insiders exiting. That perception may not be accurate, but it matters more than reality when forming sentiment. If the market believes “smart money” sold the top, everyone else assumes they're holding the bag. That belief becomes self-fulfilling: remaining holders sell to avoid being last out, which drives prices lower, reinforcing fear and driving more selling. Recent US inflation prints and Fed communications increased the odds of 2026 rate cuts, but not enough to give a clear “lower for longer” signal. Crypto mirrored every wobble in risk assets rather than trading like a haven, reinforcing the perception that Bitcoin is a high-beta tech exposure rather than a store of value. When the dollar weakened, Bitcoin rallied briefly. When risk appetite faded, Bitcoin sold off harder than equities. That pattern destroyed the “digital gold” narrative, at least for now. Additionally, regulatory progress has been messy. Europe is implementing MiCA, forcing exchanges and stablecoin issuers to comply or exit. The US GENIUS Act is turning into concrete stablecoin rules, but it won't be finalized until 2027. The CLARITY Act stalled after a long government shutdown. A January markup is the start of the sausage-making process, not the finish line Sacks claims. The industry also faces a wave of private lawsuits as SEC enforcement recedes, keeping legal risk at the forefront. None of that screams “clean runway.” The confusion matters because crypto's 2025 thesis rested on clarity: spot ETFs would bring institutional capital, a crypto-friendly administration would remove regulatory overhang, and macro conditions would favor hard assets. All three happened, but the payoff didn't materialize. That gap between thesis and outcome drives sentiment from optimism to confusion to fear. 2025 delivered a “crypto president,” spot ETFs, big-name IPOs like Circle's, and tokenization headlines from BlackRock, but prices dropped after every event. Trump's election was supposed to be bullish, but Bitcoin sold off. Spot ETF inflows hit records, but Bitcoin chopped sideways then dropped. Circle's IPO was supposed to validate the sector, but it came and went with no sustained price reaction. Each milestone became a sell-the-news trap. Altcoins underperformed badly while gold and silver stole the “hard asset” spotlight. When a sector gets most of the structural wins it's been lobbying for and still underperforms, retail's default mood shifts from euphoria to disappointment. The crypto market just nuked, with the largest ever liquidation event in 24 hours and a bloodbath for altcoins triggering traders' PTSD. The industry won policy battles, regulatory clarity, institutional access, and political support, but none of it translated into sustained price appreciation. Instead, the wins became exhaustion points: smart money sold the announcements, retail bought the hype, and prices ended up lower. Narrative fatigue means investors stop believing in the next catalyst. When every bullish event has been a selling opportunity, why would the next one be different? The market becomes a trap: good news doesn't move prices, bad news accelerates selling. That's the environment that produces extreme fear and keeps it pinned for months. The extreme fear readings capture a market that feels betrayed by its own thesis. Investors believed in the halving cycle, the ETF narrative, the regulatory clarity story, and the macro setup. All of those things happened, and the market still sold off. That's not just disappointing for traders chasing profits, it's disorienting for everyone with stakes in the market. Extreme fear can be a contrarian signal. Historically, some of the best entry points come when sentiment is at its worst. ETF flows hit $941 million in two months, but real adoption hinges on Ripple's ODL volumes, on-chain payments, and RLUSD growth on XRPL. However, that only works if underlying conditions improve. Right now, the conditions that drove fear, such as thinning liquidity, leverage overhang, macro confusion, and narrative fatigue, haven't resolved. They've settled into a new equilibrium where prices chop lower, volume declines, and nobody wants to call a bottom. Until one or more of those conditions break, sentiment will stay depressed. The question for 2026 is whether the market can find a catalyst strong enough to reverse that trend, or whether this cycle ends not with a bang but with a slow, grinding capitulation that leaves the entire narrative in ruins.

Title: The Resilience of the Church of Climate

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From Tilak’s Substack In the aftermath of the UN’s COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, several commentators have claimed that the age of climate alarmism may finally be fraying at the edges. The Wall Street Journal concluded that Europe’s green energy policies slashed emissions but at the cost of crippling the economy. PJ Media’s Rick Moran argues that “the religion of climate alarmism is in decline”. He finds that President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda and the high-profile defection from the climate alarmist priesthood by Bill Gates has begun to alter the debate over climate change. Peter Savodnik of the Free Press wrote last week that those who questioned the calamity of climate change were treated like pariahs for years but now, “their day of vindication has come”. He cites Bjorn Lomborg, who opined that “I believe we are witnessing a broader, more balanced reassessment of climate change”. The evidence against climate alarmism is no longer relegated to alternative media. It is visible in electricity bills that have exploded precisely in those countries and states – Germany, Great Britain, California – most exposed to wind and solar absolutism. It became apparent in the great Iberian Peninsula blackout in April, which lasted for hours and led to the deaths of 11 people, a systemwide failure due to insufficient fossil fuels-based synchronous generation and an excessive reliance on inverter-based solar power. It is evident in Europe’s industrial heartlands, hollowed out by irrational energy policies sold as moral imperatives but delivered as economic self-sabotage. Yet another reminder of Western Europe’s on-going deindustrialisation emerged two days ago, as the Financial Times reported that Volkswagen will stop manufacturing vehicles at its site in Dresden, marking the first time in the carmaker’s 88-year history that it will close production at a site in Germany. Even in the EU, the epicentre of green utopianism, policymakers have come under pressure from powerful business lobbies to weaken proposed ‘sustainability’ rules as part of a drive to reduce burdens on domestic enterprises. AP reported yesterday that European officials moved to ease their ban on sales of cars with internal combustion engines by 2035, responding to pressure from governments and automakers who argued that the industry needed more flexibility to help achieve EU climate goals. Climate as Theology Yet, belief in imminent climate catastrophe remains remarkably resilient among Western elites. Optimism in rationality prevailing may be premature. The Church of Climate, with its high priests and devoted flock, has proven remarkably resilient over decades, weathering empirical assaults and expert rebuttals with the tenacity of a faith unmoored from facts. The question worth asking is no longer whether the alarmists are right — they are not — but why the creed survives so unscathed by evidence, falsification and repeated policy failure. This durability is not rational. It is moral, ideological and ultimately theological. For many years now, serious scientists and scholars with unimpeachable credentials — William Happer, John Clauser, Judith Curry and many others — have demolished the claim that the climate system is threatened with an imminent apocalypse caused by fossil fuel-based emissions. Steve Koonin’s careful exposition of the data made this plain to any reader willing to separate evidence from rhetoric. And yet these arguments yield no value to the priesthood of climate alarm. The reason is simple: the dispute is not about data. It is about virtue and the seductive promise of meaningfulness. Climate alarmism long ago ceased to be a scientific hypothesis and became instead a moral identity. Its adherents see themselves as uniquely compassionate, enlightened and willing to ‘care for the planet’ in contrast to the supposedly venal, backward or morally defective climate change deniers. These ‘deniers’, as the inquisitors label them, are not fringe figures but guardians of scientific integrity against a modern Lysenkoism where dissent is heresy. Climate alarmism serves another powerful purpose. It is the modern expression of what Friedrich Hayek called the “fatal conceit“: the belief that a self-appointed elite, armed with models and moral certainty, can out-think the dispersed intelligence of markets, societies and freely choosing individuals. This conceit is reinforced by what might be called the ‘noble lie‘. Many within the climate establishment openly or tacitly believe that exaggeration is justified — indeed necessary — if it nudges the masses toward ‘correct’ behaviour. If climate change must be overstated, so be it. If uncertainty must be suppressed, that too is a price worth paying. The end — planetary salvation — justifies the means. Layered into the climate alarmist narrative is yet another dimension of political calculus that aids social-democrat governments in power throughout the West with the significant exception of Trump’s America. The ever-imminent climate catastrophe handily provides politicians with the perfect hobgoblin that elicits among their constituents’ clamorous calls for being led to safety, as H. L. Mencken reminded us in his maxim on practical politics. Given these potent advantages of having a theology of climate, empirical refutation becomes irrelevant. Data that contradicts the narrative are not debated but delegitimised. Critics are not engaged; they are denounced. Expertise is not weighed; it is moralised. Hence the curious phenomenon of genuine Nobel-calibre physicists being dismissed as ‘deniers’, while political activists and failed politicians – the Bill McKibbens, Al Gores and Michael Manns of the world – are elevated to the status of scientific authorities and prophetic sages. The Package Deal But climate alarmism does not travel alone. It is part of a broader ideological package deal — an interlocking set of beliefs that reinforce one another psychologically and politically. The same individual who believes that capitalism is a form of exploitation will tend also to believe that Western industrial society is uniquely destructive. That same person is also likely to believe that markets cannot be trusted to allocate resources and that ‘crises’ — climate, Covid, inequality — require emergency powers of an overweening state. Unsurprisingly, this worldview also aligns neatly with support for Net Zero, ESG, DEI, gender ideology, industrial policy, public health lockdowns and the ever-expanding administrative state. This ideological coherence is not accidental. It reflects the long influence of identity-based cultural Marxism, which taught generations of Western intellectuals to interpret social and economic phenomena primarily through the lens of power, domination and historical white guilt. In this worldview, the legacy of Western development — from the Age of Exploration onward — is not human flourishing but original sin. Climate change thus becomes the ultimate indictment of modernity itself: proof that prosperity, growth and technological progress were mistakes. Gad Saad’s notion of suicidal empathy yields insights into the intellectual power of the climatistas among Western intelligentsia. Suicidal empathy refers to a pattern where an individual’s deep compassion for others becomes so extreme that it leads to self-harm, burnout or the undermining of the people they are trying to help. In Saad’s words, it refers to “the inability to implement optimal decisions when our emotional system is tricked into an orgiastic, hyperactive form of empathy, deployed on the wrong targets”. The empathy for ‘people and planet’ that forms the backbone of the climate narrative had led Western policymakers to prioritise abstract moral posturing over concrete human outcomes. It is this mindset that allows Western elites to congratulate themselves on decarbonisation targets while energy poverty rises, industries flee and living standards stagnate. The victims of these policies — the coal miners, factory workers and rural households — are dismissed as collateral damage or, worse, as morally suspect ‘deplorables’. The logic of climate alarmism encompasses the familiar phenomenon of Bootleggers and Baptists: the high priests of climate virtue including the juggernaut of lavishly funded environmental NGOs provide the moral cover, while a well-connected cohort of crony capitalists harvest subsidies, mandates and guaranteed returns. Wind and solar developers, ESG financiers and asset-management behemoths such as BlackRock have every incentive to keep the crisis narrative alive. The rhetoric of sacrifice is always for others; the rents are very much for themselves. Climate policy, with its fixation on targets detached from engineering and economics, fits this pattern all too well. This is why Trump’s challenge to climate orthodoxy was so destabilising. It was not merely a policy shift; it was a moral counter-revolution. By insisting on energy abundance, national interest and economic realism, Trump and his A-team in the energy and environmental patch – Energy Secretary Chris Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum – have punctured the sanctimony of the climate elite. Executive orders can be reversed, but ideas are harder to kill — and that is precisely why the backlash has been so ferocious. No Time for Complacency Yet complacency would be a grave mistake. The perceived moral high ground remains firmly occupied by the Church of Climate, and it confers enormous political power. Should Trump’s movement falter — if the midterms deliver a repudiation rather than reinforcement, and if the next Presidential elections are lost by the MAGA movement — the entire edifice of Net Zero dogma could snap back with renewed vengeance. Democrats, buoyed by mainstream media amplification and deep-state entrenchment, would reinstate green mandates, reversing Trump’s gains. The administrative state, the ESG complex and the transnational climate bureaucracy have not gone away. They are waiting in the wings. The lesson of the past decade is sobering. Empirical truth, by itself, is not enough. Ideas matter, but so do moral narratives, institutional incentives and cultural coherence. Climate alarmism has proven resilient precisely because it is not a theory but a worldview — one that flatters its adherents, rewards its enforcers and immunises itself against doubt. If there is to be a genuine reckoning, it will require more than cheaper gas or failed wind farms. It will require reclaiming the moral language of human flourishing, exposing the hubris of central planning, and reasserting the primacy of evidence over piety. Until then, the climate apocalypse will remain postponed — but endlessly proclaimed.

Type your email… Subscribe wow the most comprehensive summary I have seen – but take heart – Trump is also bankrupting the climate NGOs as well so their noise will subside but as a former head of the UNIPCC stated- the real goal of the climate movement is the destruction of capitalism- so it will never go away as long as there are communist in charge of governments bankrupting the climate NGOs What was built once can always be rebuilt. True, except that the Church of Climate is losing adherents. And for the most part, they aren’t coming back. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. “There’s an old saying in Tennessee—I know it’s in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once, shame on—shame on you. Fool me—you can’t get fooled again.” I really liked GWB, it’s a shame his personality didn’t translate well to the job. Are they really? The true adherents are loyal and will remain loyal, since loyalty was the only thing they ever had — loyalty to the propagandists. The adherents weren’t smart enough to do their homework, research the facts, listen to the debates. They still don’t know jack about climatology, or the Ice Ages, or electricity, or anything technical. They only know being part of the herd. They will never abandon their caste. And their leaders will ride them over the cliff. It’s a Jim Jones cult. Sort of like “from the river to the sea” without being able to identify either. overall great article, but the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd. The dude wants to absorb Greenland for no other reason that it’s easy and has never tried to take the moral view on anything. he could on some topics, but it seems he regards himself as a dirty exploitative manipulator. So, the dire predictions about the green comeback in the US will probably become reality. I hope the solution will come from a change in EU. He wanted to buy Greenland, not adsorb it, whatever that it in your mind. The US considered many times during many different administrations, beginning in 1867, to make this purchase. President Trump wanted to do this to improve the defense of the US from Russia and for other reasons. Don’t look at a map to see the defense issue, look at a globe. It may then be clear to you, or perhaps not. TDS? And how. But this is what we face: a large percentage of the populace that knows nothing about anything. They don’t think for themselves. They are easily swayed by propagandists. They are sheeple with a variety of insecurities, many induced by fear p*rn merchants. We can only hope that with patience and tough love that someday some of them will catch a clue. Brainwashed sheeple. Greenland, Iceland, and the Seward Peninsula are the increasingly important strategic zones of commerce/military choke-points. Russia is opening military ports on it’s northern coastal areas. the Greenland Sea is the main channel of Northwest Passage shipping traffic. China has already tried to buy military access to Greenland. With only 60k residents, and some of the poorest people on Earth, this is easily bought. Perhaps you want to place the country which jails people for Wrong-Think in charge of global commerce, or perhaps rethink that option. Adding Greenland would be the coolest maneuver in my lifetime. I want to take back all the trillions spent defending Europe, invading the Middle East and molding Hillary’s hairdo’s and use it to buy Greenland instead. You are one sick puppy! The US is vulnerable to attacks over the North Pole. Best you put away your illogical, mentallly-corrupt TDS and look at reality. “the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd.” Your complete disconnect from reality is the only thing that is absurd here. Trump is systematically dismantling globalist subjugation of nation states. He was elected in a landslide to eliminate government mandated woke indoctrination and bring common sense and merit back as the governing principles for human development. It might be the most significant counter revolution in American history policy wise. Well Trump is a counter-revolution to the crazies and their jester puppet who they flicked for the word salad woman when the gaslighting so obviously couldn’t continue. A return to normalcy when the crazies had lost the plot completely even working out how many human genders there are (Hint: it’s the same number if you want to try and change genders Dr Mengele) The only morality involved was exposing the lie you couldn’t stop villains pouring across the southern border plus MSM lying complicity and ferretting out the worst of the slushfunding and snouts in the taxpayer trough. With hindsight what was so hard about that except the crazies squealing like stuck pigs their slops weren’t so forthcoming anymore. “the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd” There is a certain validity to that comment. I do not believe Trump is motivated to a moral counter-revolution. Trump is a business man, not a politician, and reasonably adept at making deals. Most people do not bother to consider that his words and actions are tactical. What the future brings, is unknown, in planetary energy systems, national/world politics, none of it. Beer and popcorn time. I agree. People are putting far too much faith in the Trumpster. He only has a few more years left in office and the opposition are going to wait him out. Then it’s business as usual. Personally, i don’t think the Trumpster can change the course of america in 3 years. I could be wrong. Let’s hope so. From the article: “The administrative state, the ESG complex and the transnational climate bureaucracy have not gone away. They are waiting in the wings.” That’s right. In the U.S., Republicans need to keep the majority in the U.S. House, otherwise, the Democrats will be in a position to hold up a lot of progress on Trump’s agenda. I think soon it will be obvious to even the most dense that the U.S. economy is booming and prices are coming down and will continue to come down. Gasoline prices are down to $2 a gallon in many places. Reducing the cost of gasoline by $0.80 per gallon adds about one percent to U.S. GDP growth. It also puts more money in consumers pockets as they spend less for gasoline, they can use that money to spend in another area of the economy, thus stimulating that area. Things are looking real good in the U.S, as the economy is growing at a 4.3 percent annual rate. It took Trump less than a year to turn things around and get the U.S. back on the right track. None of this would be happening if a Democrat had been elected president. The U.S. would probably be in an economic recession right now, had that happened. But, the Good Lord smiled on us. 🙂 Unfortunately, the Marxist do-gooders are always doing everything they can to shield their herded masses from any improvements in prosperity since they require “victims” to justify their actions (thus the insistence on programs and policies that hurt the poorest the most), and instead of being the vigilant exposers of corruption, the news media are divided into camps of apologists for their chosen champions. Add to that the fickle, changing with the wind “moderate center”. It is they who will decide where the power resides in the next year. Donald Trump remains his own worst enemy in that regard, since one ill-considered stumble at a critical moment can turn that inconstant element against him. Such is the nature of the identity politics morass in which we are mired. Echo chamber disconnects from reality define the left. If Republicans don’t maintain control of congress we are screwed. They have zero understanding about how things work in the real world. Virtue signalling and hate are all they have. The Republicans are not helping the cause. Too many are reverting into RINOs, probably because the inducements from lobbyists are too sweet to pass up. Our political class is a mess. We need new leaders with integrity and common sense. I think Republicans will probably hold the majority in the U.S. Senate after 2026. If the U.S. House goes Democrat, it will cause a lot of problems for Trump, but it won’t stop the economy from booming, and it won’t stop Trump’s agenda, although it may slow it down. I think the U.S. economy is going to be booming during this next year and things will look a lot better between now and then, as far as prices and other Democrat talking points are concerned. The Republican Congress should codify as much of Trump’s MAGA agenda into law as possible before the 2026 elections roll around. Just in case. 🙂 The U.S. Senate can pass Trump’s MAGA agenda under the reconciliation rules, where they don’t need 60 votes to pass the bill, just a majority. It is my understanding that they can do reconciliation votes two more times before the 2026 elections. I hope the US continues in the right direction and succeeds in recovering in energy. Most western nations are adamantly headed for the cliff. The leaders of the Western Democracies can’t tell the difference between speculation and established facts. If they could tell the difference, they would see that all this demonization of CO2 is just speculation and would not be bankrupting their nations over a Climate Crisis that has not been scientifically established as fact. “heading for the cliff” A verifiable tipping point. I agree indicators are good. News does not want to report that things are getting better so have to focus on 20-year old scandals. Can they hide it another 3 years? Just hoping no big places decide it’s a good time to invade any little places and that no bankers collapse. “Can they hide it another 3 years?” No doubt they will try. 🙂 And yes, there are still a lot of challenges ahead, but at least we have someone with common sense leading the U.S now. We need a problem solver and Trump is a problem solver. He’s trying to fix the accumulated problems of the last 50 years. And they need fixing. The media points to grasshoppers to keep reads clicking. The next biggie is what? Wait for it…. The problem is that the blue states are not seeing much improvement in economics and living conditions due to state Democrat policies. It is up to the GOP to hammer home that the red states are doing well but the Democrat miasmas are still stagnant due to Democrat policy. I agree. Some of that kind of reporting is starting. I saw several reports on Fox News comparing costs in Red States verses costs in Blue States. The Red State costs were lower. The Trump administration needs to make a big, public relations effort to refute the Democrat propaganda. And I think they intend to do so. Trump has already given two public speeches in an effort to refute the talking points of the Democrats. I saw a great chart of inflation since the first Trump administration. The inflation rate for Trump 2016 was colored red and was around 3 percent, then the portion of the chart representing Biden’s term was colored blue and showed inflation shooting up like a rocket, and then Trump’s second term shows red again, and the inflation rate is back down to around three percent (2.7 percent as of the last reading). Looking at the chart, it is obvious that the price of things skyrocketed during the Biden years. And of course, the lying Democrats want to blame Trump for the high prices. It is SO disingenuous, but that’s the Democrats for you. They have no problem lying when the truth is obviously different. They depend on the Leftwing Propaganda Media to prop their lies up. EU did not “slash” any emissions, stop repeating their lies. But they did wreck their economies in the attempt! Are destroying, not did. The Wall Street Journal reported…. That shows how reliable that media, erm, propaganda organization is. Well written article, inciteful, and so true! 2026 should be very interesting as rival factions clash. Popcorn please! I wouldn’t call what is about to happen “interesting; I’d call it frightening. If the left continues with their obstructionist behavior, we will approach the possibility of civil war. Those who don’t want to see our country moved to the extreme left and threatened by increasing lawless acts of terrorism are rapidly growing weary, even exhausted, by those threats. It seems to be escalating and simply can’t go on, as is, much longer. We are already engaged in a civil war. We are a nation divided. If you do not agree with the position and recite the rhetoric verbatim you are a denier, the enemy. No middle ground. No dispassionate, mature debate allowed. Those wishing an open debate are silenced. Every issue has valid points on both sides, but only one side is allowed a voice. Popcorn, but do not forget the beer. We need MORE CO2. Very good article. Just have to comment on the photo – seems ER is in serious decline when they have to resort to dressing up dudes in Handmaiden costumes. Perhaps fitting that their protests now feature clowns. Can anyone still take them seriously? It should be rather embarrassing for a man to be dressed in that manner. “dudes in Handmaiden costumes” I took note of that myself. I said to myself: That’s not a gal there, he has a beard. I wondered why he was there dressed like that. I suppose he could be trans, Odd. Such a different world we live in now. I pity the children trying to make sense out of all this. It’s a lot tougher now. But it can be done. You can’t take people like this seriously. I can’t imagine the thought processes going on in those heads. Dazed and Confused, comes to mind. Sadly the children are not allowed to try to make sense of this. Rather, they are being told what to believe and not taught how to think. That applies not only to the children, but to the general population. We are all being inundated with Leftwing Propaganda 24 hours a day. Best article I’ve read on the Church of Climate, with its manipulative – corrupt Priesthood and useful idiot zealot followers. This line perfectly summed up their dogma; “ In this worldview, the legacy of Western development — from the Age of Exploration onward — is not human flourishing but original sin.” The Church of Climate will have people. They shall be known as Climengelicals. And I thought they were Climinupyourassholes. Quite often Ridicule is the best weapon… Sometimes you simply have to point and laugh!!! I add my kudos to the author of this essay on a very well written piece. Net Zero, renewables and their benefactor, the Church of Climate Alarmism, all benefit from the fact that the alarmist narrative is not a formally organized or recognized religion or church in the usual sense of the words. Thus, they are able to escape the separation of church and state mandated in the U.S. Constitution. This benefit helps them receive financial support at taxpayer expense with too little objection from the latter, although Trump now appears to be a threat to that financial support. The trolls here at WUWT ignore the problems with wind and solar energy involving physics, toxic waste, and other matters. Thus, they provide the evidence of the religious and cult-like nature of so-called renewable energy. The same goes for the climate narrative itself—the disconfirming science that shoots down the scare doesn’t matter anymore. Anyone promoting the disconfirmation is guilty of heresy and Orwellian thought-crime. It is fortunate heretics aren’t burnt at the stake anymore. And anyone familiar with the novel knows what happened to Winston Smith in Orwell’s 1984. The excessive amounts that electricity that users in the UK, Germany, California and elsewhere must pay on their bills can be viewed as tithes to this church. These tithes are the punishment for the sins of all of us against Holy Mother Earth and her climatic and environmental systems. Never mind that the Earth is getting greener. The decisions of the High Priests are final. I too worry that that climate alarmism will make a roaring comeback if the Democrats retake the U.S. Congress in 2026 and/or the White House in 2028. As much as I would prefer not to say this, never underestimate the ability of the U.S. voter to make bad decisions. The alarmists are like a predator just waiting in the wings to pounce on its prey when the opportunity presents itself. This is what could potentially happen when too little or no effort is made to educate the masses on the problems with renewables and the climate scare. Most of them probably don’t care enough to look into the issues themselves anyway. We will just have to wait and see what happens. Underlying all of this is an excessively high level of arrogance, egotism and misallocated self-righteousness found in the High Priests and believers that are probably nothing new in human history. MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL. Trump was a putz first term for not allowing Happer to do the red team/blue team debate about climate. If people knew the facts ideological zealots would be relegated as laughing stocks to be shamed for their idiocy. I have to wonder. With all the different life forms on this planet, can Mother Earth be considered a virgin? Excellent ! I’ve linked it on my https://cosy.com/DailyBlog.html with rare 4 * , and key quote : ” the seductive promise of meaningfulness “ Great article! Shame is the only way I can see the ideological disconnects from reality being broken. Their egoistic belief in the nobility and superiority of their position is impossible to influence because ideology has replaced reason. Why reason doesn’t work on them. The sheer idiocy of their beliefs needs to be called out at every opportunity. Climate denier shaming keeps them in their lane so maybe calling them climate idiots could get their egos to wake up. Shame augmented with ridicule. I caught this typo (corrected here) in the last sentence of the first paragraph under the sub-heading “Climate as Theology” in the above article: “. . . This durability is not rational. It is moral amoral, ideological and ultimately theological.” Otherwise, a great article! The Package Deal I’ve been noticing this for ages. Any “progressives” that don’t sign on to the “whole package” are committing sacrilege, risking excommunication from “the movement”. Very nice Tilak. This is what I have been saying though not nearly as eloquent as you. We don’t have a climate problem, we don’t have a science problem we do have a government problem. Government at all levels need to be called out for lying and cheating. As I have said before take away the strong arm of government and the problem goes away. It is that simple. The fanatics pushing CAGW are completely powerless and meaningless without the force of government. Take away the strong arm of government and these guys would be forced to defend their fanatic declarations with actual science and the observations to prove it. They have nothing and no one knows that better than them. On one level, this climate thing has a religious flavour. Have you noticed how religions use logic when it suits them, and dogma when it doesn’t. You can have a logical discussion with a believer up to a point, but you can never take it past that point. It would be good if the same did not occur in science, but as Max Planck and others have pointed out, it has gone on for centuries. It used to be called gatekeeping, but climate scientists have used the opaqueness of models to take it to a whole new dimension. In science, at least the facts can get through in the end, albeit often decades late. That is why, as others have pointed out, Net Zero is being separated from climate science. Both are crumbling, but in different ways. If connected, when one falls they both fall. By separating them, the blob (for want of a better word) hope they can save at least one. There is still a lot of hard work ahead – the honest people now have to fight on two fronts. There have always been fashions in thought, just as in everything else, including clothing, architecture, and building and automotive design. It is never rational, but the adherents follow it nonetheless, no matter how ridiculous it makes them look. The now-collapsing thinking regarding so-called “climate change” and the degree to which it is apocalyptic is just another example of this human weakness. There are many champagne socialists among the climate alarmists; in fact, few people would be surprised to find that they dominate the movement. They have little to lose by espousing the CAGW theory and many stand to profit from it either through career advancement and/or financially. So as long as their beliefs are being questioned or being abandoned completely, they will fight like tigers to keep propping them up because the stakes are too high not to do so. You can understand a lot of liberalism by recognizing liberals’ deep need to feel superior — intellectually, but also morally. Maybe there is medical hope for them after all. story tip Why some people keep making the same bad decisions | ScienceDaily “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Whoever wins… we lose? Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts If Warner Bros. Discovery was only a movie house, it would have had one of its best years ever. Two of its films (One Battle After Another and Sinners) are front-runners for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it had a string of critical hits and box-office successes with Superman, Weapons, and A Minecraft Movie. But the company is a media conglomerate that counts HBO and CNN among the brands it owns, and it took on lots of debt; its box-office success in 2025 is not enough to make up for its financial struggles. This year, the company found itself up for auction. After over a hundred years as a major Hollywood studio, Warner Bros. fate seemed unclear. Now months into a process that Netflix formally won, Paramount still hopes to come out on top with a hostile bid. This week even, the billionaire Larry Ellison, whose son, David, controls Paramount, offered a personal guarantee for the deal. The bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery is a business story that morphed into a future-of-entertainment story and then recently took an ominous turn into politics. President Donald Trump weighed in, saying he would be “involved” in deciding who wins, which put every party on alert that Trump might be particularly watching what happens to CNN, a cable network he has called “the least trusted name in news” and a “political arm of the Democrat Party.” Trump has sued ABC News, CBS News, the BBC, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. His administration has federally defunded PBS and NPR, and put pressure on networks to cancel late-night shows. In the Warner Bros. Discovery bidding war, Trump has hinted that he leans toward Paramount, and this week brought new claims of political interference of the news at the Ellison-run Paramount. 60 Minutes pulled a segment on the harsh conditions at a prison in El Salvador where the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans earlier this year. Bari Weiss, the new head of CBS News, said the story needed more work even though it had apparently been fact-checked and legally vetted, not to mention promoted on air. In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk to the Atlantic film critic David Sims about what the outcome of this deal might mean for movie lovers, especially those who hope to keep going to movies in theaters. And we talk to our staff writer Frank Foer about Trump’s increasing influence on the media landscape and his subtle campaign to disappear CNN. The following is a transcript of the episode: Hanna Rosin: I know we’re months from the Oscars, but will you name your top-three picks for Best Picture? David Sims: In terms of who I think may well win? Rosin: Mm. Sims: Or who I want to win? Rosin: Mm. Sims: (Laughs.) Rosin: I think I’m gonna go with want. I think I’m gonna go with want. That’s— Sims: I’ve got the same pick for both, honestly, is I do think One Battle After Another will win out; I would say Sinners and Hamnet are the other sort of big players right now. Rosin: I was hoping you would say One Battle After Another and Sinners, only so I could have a smooth transition into the conversation I want to have with you. Sims: Absolutely. [Music] Rosin: One Battle After Another and Sinners, two front-runners for the Oscar for Best Picture, both came out of the same studio this year: Warner Bros. Sims: Those are movies from very established filmmakers with big stars in them. Leonardo DiCaprio (as Bob Ferguson in One Battle After Another): My name is Bob Ferguson. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of me, all right? I was part of French 75. Sims: But they were for grown-ups. These are R-rated movies. Michael B. Jordan (as Elijah “Smoke” Moore in Sinners): Y’all Klan? Jack O’Connell (as Remmick in Sinners): Sir. We believe in equality and music. Sims: They were going up against more established franchise stuff, and they dominated the conversation. Rosin: This is Atlantic movie critic David Sims. Sims: They did well in every kind of space. Rosin: It was also the same studio that made Weapons, Superman, and A Minecraft Movie— critical hits, along with box-office successes—movies for families and movies for families who like Paul Thomas Anderson. Sims: They had the kind of year studio executives dream of. Rosin: So what better way to end a banner year at Warner Bros. Pictures than by selling it? This fall, Warner Bros. Discovery—which includes all of its movie studios, HBO, DC Comics, and a bunch of other things—announced that it was on the market. An initial front-runner was Paramount. Sims: So Paramount was there—it was an existing movie studio, recently bought by David Ellison after he spent years trying to take it over. He’s the son of Larry Ellison. He’s a very, very rich tech billionaire. Rosin: But their bid was rejected. So Paramount kept submitting more bids, and those were all rejected too. Meanwhile (Netflix sound effect plays.) Netflix was also interested and swooped in. Wolf Blitzer (from CNN): New this morning, Netflix has inked a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to buy the iconic TV and movie studio and its streaming assets, including HBO. We should mention— [Music] Rosin: This is Radio Atlantic. I’m Hanna Rosin. The bidding war for Warner Bros. is a business story that’s morphing into an entertainment story and then took an ominous turn into politics. President Donald Trump: So we’ll have to see what happens. Rosin: Recently, President Donald Trump weighed in on the matter, suggesting that he was personally interested in the outcome—which adds a whole new layer of complication. Trump: And I’ll be involved in that decision too. But they have a very big market share. For those of us who care more about the movies? The truth is that both options might make them a little worse—for different reasons. And for those of us who care most about democracy? It would not be the first time that the president has inserted himself into the business of media. We’ll talk to staff writer Frank Foer about that later. But first, critic David Sims on what he pays the most attention to: What does this Warner Bros. Discovery deal mean for the movies when the number of big movie studios just keeps shrinking? Sims: Obviously, this is a looming nightmare that Hollywood has been worried about for longer than the last few months. And for the last few years, Warner Bros., which is one part of a big conglomeration of TV networks and other stuff has been a company that’s sort of laden with debt and has had some bad corporate owners in the past, that’s been passed around, so a lot of people have been waiting to see who will swoop in to sort of salvage the company or transform it. And the fear’s always been, It’ll get sucked up too. The Hollywood studios will continue to sort of condense into a bigger and bigger blob, which, really, it means nothing good for art, unfortunately. Rosin: Okay, well, slow that down ’cause you said “fear”—you’re separating, already, in your answer quality from financial stability. So it was a studio that made good movies but was financially not stable, I guess, for a while, so why “fear”—why don’t we see this as rescuing Warner Bros.? Sims: Well, Warner Bros., the movie studio itself, there’s not a huge profit issue there. That’s the sort of jewel of the company, along with HBO, which is part of this corporate consideration. It’s the other stuff that’s been the problem, and David Zaslav, who’s been running the company for a few years at this point, since it merged with Discovery, has been trying to cut fat. He’s laid people off. He’s canceled whole movies outright. He’s been running it pretty lean, and I think everyone in the industry has been watching and sort of noting that he’s clearly preparing to get acquired. Now, in the old days, Warner Bros. used to be owned by AT&T. Before then, it was owned by AOL. Back in the day, Coca-Cola used to own one of the movie studios. Big companies would own movie studios ’cause it was fun to own a movie studio—you would get to be a player in Hollywood, and you would have glitz and glamour. But now, it feels like the only companies that want these movie studios are other movie studios. Rosin: So let me ask you: If, for years and years, big companies have owned movie studios, why is this moment such a big deal? Why do people like you talk about it with trepidation in their voices—nd “people like you,” I mean people who love movies and movie theaters and just the whole tradition of Hollywood? Why is this any different than Coca-Cola or anybody else? Sims: Well, so it feels like there’s two outcomes to this Warner Bros. deal, it seems, and both of them are causing agita for different reasons. [Music] Sims: If Paramount, which is another big studio, had bought Warner Bros., you have what happened to Disney and Fox, probably, happening again, so Fox still exists in some form, as a sort of subsidiary of Disney—t releases a few movies a year—but you’ve kind of dried up one of the wells of big movie production in Hollywood. If that happens with Paramount owning Warner Bros., once again, you feel the pool of big movies shrinking in Hollywood. You feel this sort of competition shrinking. Now, Netflix is this kind of different beast because they operate a different model. They’ve made money a different way. Obviously, they’re all in on streaming. So far, they’ve sort of communicated publicly, like, Oh, no, no, no. Warner Bros. is a different business than ours, and we wouldn’t wanna kill its theatrical industry. But because Netflix has been so uniquely aggressive about sort of getting their movies onto TV rather than in theaters, there’s this just huge anxiety amongst people like me and people who make movies that the movie-theater industry just cannot survive losing that many movies a year, if that’s where this is going. Rosin: Why are theatrical—this is not obvious to me. It seems to me—what I care about is that good movies get made. Why is theatergoing the lifeblood of good movies? Does it change the incentive structure of what kind of movies you make and how good or creative or original they are? Sims: Possibly. Look, Netflix has made good movies, but there is a sort of style to a lot of Netflix movies—the more sort of generic stuff that they put out: the rom-coms and the sort of medium-size dramas, whatever—that feels like the movie’s a little more designed to be ignored. Rosin: Mm. Sims: Now— Rosin: Ah, now I understand it. (Laughs.) That feels like a real concern—if you’re creating movies that you know people are going to be checking their phone while watching. Sims: I think when you talk to the sort of older guard in Hollywood, who are especially worried about the mortality of theaters, there’s also just this feeling of, like, When it’s gone, it won’t come back. [Music] Sims: And all of those companies are—they’ve been battered by COVID, they were hurt by the strikes, which really reduced the amount of output lately, and they’re kind of hanging on by a thread right now. Big movies will come out and do well and kind of demonstrate that audiences are fine going to the theater for something they’re interested in. But it’s tougher for a sort of mid-sized or smaller movie to break out in the ways that they used to—which is why, again, one reason that something like Sinners or One Battle, those films catching on with people is heartening to see because it kind of defies the prediction that companies like Netflix are making of, Ah, well, that old model, that’s sort of dinosaur stuff, and people prefer to just have an a la carte selection at home of whatever they can watch. Rosin: So we’ve been discussing the Netflix outcome. Tell me what happened with Paramount and what’s the Paramount outcome. How do you see that differently than what you’ve just described? Sims: I think one reason the Netflix bid seems to have won is that Netflix was cool with Warner Bros., the company, sort of splitting up and its cable channels—these sort of less profitable units—getting spun off and turned into a division that can be dealt with elsewhere or sold off or who knows. And Netflix would take control of kind of the big properties: Warner Bros., HBO, things like that. Paramount seems to want the whole kit and caboodle; they want everything. They’re willing to pay a lot for it. And it’s a little harder to understand why, outside of, I guess, just this notion of, We need to be as big as possible to compete. Paramount on its own used to be a very venerable—it’s still venerable, but now they don’t have a Marvel, and they don’t have the kind of streaming service that Netflix or HBO is. So if they can just kind of grow by acquisition, grow by expanding into new areas of storytelling—they can make more comic-book movies, whatever—that’s their argument for: This is the best way to survive. That might be true for Paramount. It might lead to a lot of layoffs and a lot of consolidation as well. There’s literally just less movies in theaters than there used to be. And so consolidation, you imagine more of that. Rosin: Right. So whatever the details, you see this as a lose-lose for Hollywood. Sims: Oh God, I hate to be so pessimistic. I’m usually not the pessimist, I will say. But it’s tough for me to see either of these being smooth. Both of these will be strange corporate maneuvers. It currently seems like the Netflix thing will happen. But, obviously, Paramount’s exploring this idea of a hostile bid. Combining Netflix and HBO, you’ve got two of the biggest streaming services—that’s a whole mess that maybe regulators won’t object to. There’s the Trump factor of terms of he maybe prefers a bidder—maybe he doesn’t, though? A lot of the reporting seems to suggest maybe he wasn’t as swayed by the Ellisons as the Ellisons thought he would be. Who knows? All of this is very difficult to foresee. And I think Warner Bros. did not really see this coming. The old rumor was that they wanted Universal, who’s another studio, to get them, and those two powers would combine into something very, very powerful. This is weird in a new way, and it’s kind of like the story of Hollywood of, every year, there’s sort of a new evolution of weird that everyone in the industry just has to wrestle with. Rosin: David, thank you so much for joining us today. Sims: Happy to. Anytime. [Music] Rosin: After the break, Frank Foer on what happens if Trump does intervene on this deal. And remember: Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t just in the movie business. They also own CNN. [Break] Rosin: The movies are just one part of this Warner Bros. Discovery deal. As we’ll hear from staff writer Frank Foer, politics is another. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, President Donald Trump privately told people that he wanted this deal to be a competition, to have one side bid against the other for his approval of the deal. Frank Foer: Because, ultimately, in order to get a merger of this size through, it needs to be blessed by the U.S. government. And it seems like the biggest condition that he’s laid out there is CNN. Rosin: CNN. Okay, so you think that’s his main interest. What does he want from CNN? Foer: So Warner Bros. owns CNN, and I think that he hates CNN, that he says it’s run by corrupt, terrible people, and he wants to see them out. Does that mean that he wants to see CNN kind of left on the side of the road to wither and die? Does it mean that he wants the new buyer to come in and renovate CNN in the same sort of way that the Ellisons have come in to CBS News and installed Bari Weiss and to turn that into a different type of news-gathering organization? It’s unclear. I don’t think Trump knows. I think he’s waiting for the bidders to come and present him with the best prize. Rosin: Okay. I think I need to understand how unusual this level of intervention is. What is the president’s usual official role in a big merger like this? Foer: So the whole United States government is set up to avoid this type of direct political meddling. [Music] Foer: We have agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, which were set up almost a hundred years ago, or more than a hundred years ago in the case of the FTC. And they were supposed to be independent agencies, where you had a set of commissioners—you would have three from the party in charge, two from the out party—where they would make decisions in a relatively bipartisan, technocratic way, in the best interest of the government, so that you didn’t have presidents coming in and picking winners and losers. But I think it’s pretty clear that, in the end, he’s got a little bit of a rooting interest for Paramount, but he doesn’t wanna make it seem as if he’s putting his thumb on the scale, because that would be bad—that would send bad signals to the world, bad signals to the market. And so, even if he may gesture in the direction of Paramount, I think even Donald Trump knows that he needs to make it look like an open and fair competition. Rosin: Got it. So he’s, basically, somewhat aware of the kinds of criticisms that a person like Frank Foer at The Atlantic might make, is, This is inappropriate. Foer: Right. This is a transaction, and so Warner Bros. has shareholders who have to approve a merger themselves and sign up for a deal; they initially signed up to give their company to Netflix. And really, there is a bidding war going on, and part of the bidding war is that—what Paramount says that it brings to the table is that it can get the approval of the president of the United States; it can make it a much more painless transaction than the Netflix purchase. Rosin: It’s like they’ve already acceded to a world in which the president’s approval or disapproval actually makes a difference in how you do business. It’s like we live in that world now. Foer: Yeah, yeah. And Netflix understands that too; that’s why Ted Sarandos went and visited—the CEO of Netflix went and visited Donald Trump in the Oval Office himself. This is the world that we live in. Rosin: So let’s play out the scenario under Trump. What moves has he already made to exert influence over media? Foer: Right. So we could look at what’s happened to The Washington Post. [Music] Foer: During the first Trump term, Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post—or he bought it before Trump—but he recreated the paper, essentially, as a resistance paper: Democracy dies in darkness. Jeff Bezos: It is a mistake for any elected official, in my opinion, to attack media and journalists. I believe that— (Audience claps.) Foer: And Trump sees this happening, and he sees the Super Bowl ad they make. Tom Hanks (in a Washington Post commercial): Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free. (Music swells.) Foer: And he starts to tweet about how Jeff Bezos is a corrupt guy and that he’s gonna take revenge against Amazon, which he says is doing all sorts of unfair things. TV anchor (from CNBC): President Trump going after Amazon again, this time in a series of tweets. He writes: “So many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are Fake News. They are as bad as ratings challenged @CNN.” Lobbyists for Amazon— Foer: So Bezos sees this happening and he, I think, either consciously or subconsciously, decides that he’s gonna walk away from this resistance persona, and he’s gonna recreate the editorial board of The Washington Post, which he more directly controls, as being something that’s more politically sympathetic to Donald Trump. TV anchor (from CNN): —after the publisher announced that the newspaper will not endorse a candidate for president. That’s the first time they have not done so in 36 years of presidential elections. The Post itself— Foer: Or to take another example, we saw the way in which Brendan Carr, the [chairman] of the FCC, said stations that were carrying Jimmy Kimmel—that because of everything that Jimmy Kimmel had said about Charlie Kirk, that they were gonna pay a price. Brendan Carr (on The Benny Show): —changes that we’ve seen, but, frankly, when you see stuff like this—look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Foer: And it turned out that a lot of these companies were in the process of undergoing mergers and consolidations—they had a lot of deals sitting in front of the Trump administration—and so they heard his message, and they said, Okay, we’re pulling Jimmy Kimmel from the air. Rosin: Right, although they did say the decision to pull Kimmel wasn’t actually influenced by FCC communication. But, okay, so let’s overlay those dynamics onto the Warner Bros. sale. What does it look like? Play out what it could look like. Foer: So we’ve talked about CNN, which, I think, is kind of the most vulnerable asset there. I think that— Rosin: Wait, so what happens to CNN? Just—this is hypothetical. Foer: Right. So, hypothetically, they could either say that, We’re gonna buy CNN as part of this deal, and we’re just gonna kill CNN. Rosin: Paramount could, if Paramount— Foer: Paramount could do that. Rosin: —or Netflix. Foer: Or Netflix. Netflix doesn’t do news, and so they could just say, You know what? If it’s a cost of doing this transaction that you’re forcing us to buy CBS—anything is possible in this sort of world where these types of sums of money are on the table, and there’s an enormous amount of flexibility. The other scenario—and we’re seeing this with CBS News, which is kind of what I’d call the Orbánification scenario, where Viktor Orbán is the head of state in Hungary, and what he’s done is, essentially, ensured that the biggest media properties in that country are sold to his allies and cronies, who, in turn, neuter those networks or turn them into propaganda apparatus. And so there’s some possibility that that happens. But if Paramount decided to go through with that, it would be painful for Paramount. Rosin: But why? We just had a perfect model for that, which is: Bari Weiss takes over CBS; Erika Kirk is the first interview. Plenty of people got fired, but it happened. Foer: It happens; it’s not unthinkable. But CNN is different than CBS. CBS News is something that aims to be straight down the middle. CNN, I think, aims to be straight down the middle, but is, in fact, kind of an anti-Trump network. Rosin: I see, so it would be more obvious and much more of a fight. Foer: Yeah. You would lose more viewership that way. You’d lose hosts who, I think, have built personas around criticizing Trump. It would be messy. Rosin: Right. Okay, so that’s instability for us who work in this industry. But do the shifts in journalism matter for anyone else? Foer: Right, so if you take The Washington Post. [Music] Foer: The Washington Post editorial page had limited reach. But in terms of kind of national voices, there were three national newspapers, three editorial boards. You have The Wall Street Journal, which is already kind of right-wing, and then you take another one and you make it right wing, you’ve changed a substantial portion of the opinion space in national newspaper land. There are only three meaningful cable networks. One of them is already pro-Trump. You take another one off the table—you’re changing a substantial percentage of cable news. A democracy is basically only as good as the information that its citizenry gets, and so we are undergoing this long-term crisis where the quality of information that citizens get has been diminished—it’s more likely to be manipulated by algorithms or by outside actors—and that, if we ever have any chance of having a democratic revival in this country, we need there to be quality sources of information. Rosin: Sometimes I think back to the first days that Jimmy Kimmel was fired and what a shock that was to the country because that was the first time that such an overt pressure happened from the administration, which had such an obvious consequence for a well-known media figure. But then he was reinstated. So is there any hope in that? Foer: Yeah, I think that there is hope in that, because there was a public backlash. I think that it was a moment where they pushed too hard, and they went too far, and I think a lot of people who may have otherwise cowered or turned away felt compelled to push back. But, on the other hand, I just look at things relative to where they were in the first Trump term and the whole tenor of conversation. And in the first Trump term, I think a lot of media looked at outrageous things, and they responded with outrage. And here, this is not just because of all these larger economic tides that we’re talking about, but there is a greater numbness that, I think, prevails. It’s less red-blooded. It’s less full-throated. It’s more numb. Rosin: Thank you, Frank, for joining us today. Foer: My pleasure. [Music] Rosin: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Jinae West.

Title: Bitcoin’s 2025 review: The “violent transformation” hidden behind the year’s deceptively flat price chart

Bitcoin's tumultuous year saw regulatory embrace, miner crises, and Wall Street's long-awaited entry into the crypto realm. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. 2025 delivered a brutal lesson in market structure for Bitcoin. The year began with political momentum and drifted into a summer of aggressive policy signals. Yet, it snapped into one of the sharpest boom-to-bust sequences in the asset’s history. By December, the price had round-tripped, leaving the asset flat for the year. But the flat chart masked a violent transformation underneath. While Wall Street banks finally opened their doors and ETFs vacuumed up record capital, the network’s physical infrastructure faced a solvency crisis. CryptoSlate has compiled some of the major trends that defined the market in 2025 below: President Trump moved from election promises to execution. On March 6, the White House signed Executive Order 14233, formally establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). The US considers untapped financial resources, like tariff revenues and gold revaluation, to fund Bitcoin acquisitions. The order consolidated forfeited federal bitcoin holdings into a dedicated US Digital Asset Stockpile, ending the era of sporadic auctions by the US Marshals. A week later, lawmakers introduced the BITCOIN Act of 2025 to codify this framework. This legislation transformed the US government from a net seller into a strategic holder, signaling to global sovereigns that Bitcoin is a recognized reserve asset. Following this lead, states like Texas and Pennsylvania launched similar initiatives. Internationally, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland began exploring sovereign accumulation. In the corporate sector, the “Bitcoin Treasury” trend accelerated. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and over 100 other public companies now hold more than 1 million BTC on their balance sheets, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Sam Callahan, the director of Strategy and Research at Oranje BTC, explained that these entities embraced BTC because it “is a superior reserve asset to gold.” According to him: “Bitcoin is digital. Bitcoin is fully auditable in real time, and can be transferred instantly. Bitcoin has an absolute fixed supply. Gold’s supply will continue to expand, forever, from ongoing mining.” Another major milestone that defined the year was the traditional financial regulatory environment that shifted to accommodate Bitcoin. Over the past year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its sister financial organizations, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have made significant regulatory progress that has enshrined Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. For context, the CFTC approved Bitcoin as a valid margin in regulated derivatives markets, and the US Federal Housing also recognized the top crypto as an asset for mortgage qualification in the United States. However, the most significant changes came from the banking regulators, which fully embraced Bitcoin. FSOC dropped Bitcoin from its vulnerabilities list in 2025, coordinating with the GENIUS Act and OCC bank charters to normalize institutional access. Earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued Interpretative Letter 1188. This document clarified that national banks can execute “riskless principal” crypto transactions. Previously, banks hesitated to broker trades because they did not want to hold volatile assets on their balance sheets. A “riskless principal” trade solves this. It allows a bank to buy an asset from a seller and resell it to a buyer immediately. The bank facilitates liquidity but never holds market risk. This letter, combined with conditional charter approvals for firms like BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Ripple National Trust Bank, effectively integrated crypto into the US banking stack. Due to these regulatory milestones, banks that hitherto treated Bitcoin as a reputational risk have changed their stance. In 2025, they began fighting for market share. Notably, CryptoSlate previously reported that 60% of the top 25 US banks now pursue strategies to sell, safeguard, or advise on Bitcoin. This shows that major financial institutions like PNC Bank, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and others opened their operations to enable Bitcoin trading and custody for interested clients. PNC's agency model with Coinbase spotlights a secure path for Bitcoin adoption amid complex regulations. Considering this level of growth, Bitcoin analyst Joe Consorti argued that BTC had become “too big for Wall Street to ignore.” Away from the banks embrace of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market also provided strong performance for industry players this year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the ETF landscape. This year, IBIT has attracted over $25 billion in inflows, ranking it sixth among all US ETFs. Crucially, investors used Bitcoin differently from gold. While the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) saw inflows as gold hit record highs, Bitcoin ETF inflows persisted even as BTC's price stagnated. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg's ETF analyst, said: “IBIT is the only ETF on the 2025 Flow Leaderboard with a negative return for the year…That's a really good sign long term IMO. If you can do $25 billion in bad year imagine the flow potential in good year.” Indeed, BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world, had described BTC as one of this “year’s biggest investment themes.” Considering this, market analysts explained that investors treated Bitcoin as a structural accumulation play rather than a momentum trade. Bitcoin's evolution reflects in off-chain ETF growth and reduced on-chain activity despite decentralized roots. Meanwhile, other positive developments within the ETF complex saw the US SEC approve “in-kind” creations and redemptions for spot ETFs. This technical change enabled Authorized Participants (APs) to swap actual BTC for ETF shares, rather than first converting to cash. At the same time, the financial regulator also allowed options on IBIT to go live. This provided hedgers and basis traders with the necessary tools to manage risk, completing the institutional derivatives stack. Unsurprisignly, BTC's price action followed its own volatile script. In early October, Bitcoin broke resistance to set a new all-time high above $125,000. Bitcoin faces record institutional demand and macroeconomic uncertainty, key drivers converging to push it to new highs. While the government and ETFs bought, long-term holders sold. On-chain data showed that wallets holding Bitcoin for 155 days or more contributed heavily to the October rally. This distribution, combined with macro-deleveraging, drove prices back under $90,000, which represented an over 30% correction. Meanwhile, global macroeconomic conditions complicated the picture. The US economy has seen significant Federal Reserve rates cut this year, with some arging that these moves were a positive for BTC price performance. However, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) simultaneously inched rates higher, tightening global liquidity and squeezing speculative carry trades. Japan's monetary shift scrutinizes yen's role in crypto trades, hinting at broader market challenges. Still, despite this market conditions, Bitcoin advocates believe the top crypto would shine. Pierre Rochard, the CEO of the Bitcoin Bond Company, said: “Bitcoin can be understood as a global “savings reservoir” for excess capital: when interest rates are low, liquidity is abundant, and high expected ROIC real investments are scarce, savings migrate into Bitcoin because it is a finite scarcity, a global digital open source network with a fixed 21 million supply.” While Wall Street integrated Bitcoin, the miners securing the network faced a crisis. Following the October peak, BTC's hashrate collapsed from a peak of 1.3 zetahash per second (zh/s) to 852 EH/S recently. It has recovered to 1.09 zh/s as fof press time. Hashrate is the lifeblood of Bitcoin security, which is used to drive the network trust. The higher the hashrate, the harder it is for any attacker to rewrite Bitcoin’s ledger. So, as BTC's price corrected below $90,000, older machines became a liability to Bitcoin miners. This is because the total cost to produce 1 BTC (including depreciation) for the average listed miner hovers near $137,800. With spot prices trading at a $47,000 discount to production cost, margins evaporated. To survive, miners pivoted to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC). Seven of the top ten miners now report revenue from AI contracts. Ranking the top Bitcoin miners by AI revenue and hashrate reveals how the industry’s leaders are redefining scale. Google emerged as a key financier in this shift. Rather than acquiring mining firms outright, Google provided credit support to help miners upgrade their infrastructure for AI workloads. This transition signals a permanent change in the industry: miners are evolving into hybrid energy-compute centers to hedge against Bitcoin volatility. Despite all of the institutional progress and positives of the past year, the psychological fears remained. 2025 was the year of integration. The “plumbing” is no longer theoretical. ETFs now function with in-kind efficiency, banks possess the regulatory clearance to trade, and the U.S. government formally holds the asset. However, the miner insolvency crisis and the LTH sell-off proved that structural adoption does not guarantee “up only” price action. Bitcoin is now fully exposed to the ruthless efficiency of macro markets. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: 2025 Review: these are the 10 most important events of the year, according to AFP

A year full of upheavals, conflicts and developments with a global footprint is captured in the report of the Agence France-Presse (AFP) for 2025. From Donald Trump‘s tumultuous return to the White House and the fragile balances in the Middle East and Ukraine, to the social uprisings of Generation Z, colossal investments in artificial intelligence and record-breaking extreme weather events, ten events marked the year and shaped the international landscape, highlighting an era of intense uncertainty and profound change. Here is the review of 2025: Attack of protectionism, mass deportations of illegal immigrants, dismantling entire sections of the federal government… After returning in January to the White House for a second term, Republican Donald Trump has embarked on a barrage of measures under his doctrine of “America first”, making extensive use of executive orders, though the judiciary blocked some of his decisions. Disregarding, according to opponents, fundamental rights and other powers, he targeted opponents, sent militias into major cities led by Democrats, attempted to intimidate the media, and fought diversity and inclusion programs. He also developed intense diplomatic activity, with more or less success. Polls, however, show growing dissatisfaction among Americans on economic issues, especially the cost of living. Sound defeats in local polls have put his party in a vulnerable position ahead of the midterm presidential election in the fall of 2026. US pressure resulted in a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, two years after the devastating war in the Gaza Strip erupted following an unprecedented attack by the Islamist Palestinian movement Hamas on 7 October 2023 on Israeli soil. The ceasefire has allowed for a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip, the exchange of the last hostages held alive in Gaza for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and increased humanitarian aid entering Gaza, although that aid still falls significantly short of needs, according to the UN and non-governmental organizations. Israel is awaiting the return of one last hostage body before it begins consultations on the second phase of the ceasefire, a stage that, under the terms of the U.S.- and U.N.-endorsed plan, must lead to the demilitarization of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped that this second phase would begin “very soon, but violence continues to rock that territory, with both parties accusing each other of ceasefire violations. Regional tensions continue with continued Israeli strikes on the strongholds of the Shiite Hezbollah movement in Lebanon. Iran was also hit by Israeli and US raids on its nuclear facilities during a 12-day war in June with Israel, which erupted from an Israeli attack. In September, Israel targeted Hamas officials in an unprecedented attack in Qatar. Donald Trump’s return to power marked the first serious efforts aimed at ending the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The praise and blame of the US president fluctuated between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky. In February, Donald Trump lashed out at the Ukrainian president in front of cameras and inside the Oval Office, accusing him of being ungrateful to the United States. Direct talks between Russians and Ukrainians in Istanbul and then a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska failed to produce any concrete progress toward peace, and Washington announced sanctions against the Russian oil sector in October. International negotiations were nevertheless held in late November based on a US draft, the initial version of which was considered by Kiev and its European allies to be too favourable to Moscow. After a new round of talks with Trump’s envoys in December, Ukraine said “progress” had been made, though the issue of Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory remains at an impasse. On the front, the Russian military has continued its slow advance into the east, after completely pushing Ukrainian forces out of the Russian border region of Kursk in March. Moscow has stepped up its strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure and the Ukrainian railway network, while Kiev is targeting oil facilities in Russia. Citing trade deals unfavorable to his country, Donald Trump announced in waves additional tariffson products imported into the United States, which varied depending on countries or zones of origin. It also imposed specific customs duties on sectors considered strategic (steel, aluminum or copper). As the targeted countries considered or implemented trade retaliation, they began tough negotiations that resulted in numerous agreements, such as with the European Union or, in late October, with China, marking the beginning of a truce in a conflict that shook the global economy. Bilateral negotiations were instead suspended with Canada after an anti-protectionist ad that the US president found offensive. Pushing to lower the cost of living for Americans, Donald Trump agreed in mid-November to cancel customs tariffs on certain foods, such as imported coffee and imported beef. Robert Francis Prevost became on 8 May, at the age of 69, the first American pope, following the death of his predecessor, Francis, to whom he was an adviser. The white smoke, announcing the election of the 267th head of the Catholic Church, rose over the Sistine Chapel after a brief conclave of cardinals that lasted less than 24 hours. Smiling and unassuming, Prevost, born in Chicago and counted among the moderate cardinals, took the name Leo XIV. The new pontiff, who was for nearly 20 years a missionary in Peru, whose citizenship he has taken, continues his predecessor’s work with social action for the poor, immigrants and ecology. At the same time, he also gave reassurances to conservative circles, allowing a traditional mass to resume in the Vatican after three years of restrictions. He ruled out in the short term the ordination of women as deacons or the recognition of same-sex marriage. In Asia, Africa, or Latin America, young people of Generation Z (under 30) have multiplied mobilizations for improved living conditions and against social media exclusion or elite corruption. They held marches in Peru against the growing insecurity and order of politicians, or in Morocco, where the authorities launched efforts in social sectors, but also prosecuted more than 2,000 people. In other countries, the protests, which were violently suppressed, developed into a wider challenge to power: after riots in Nepal, Maoist Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli had no choice but to resign. In Madagascar, mobilisation led to the military overthrowing President Andri Rajoelina, who fled abroad. In Tanzania, young people participated en masse in post-election protests, which were drowned in blood. The pirate manga One Piece flag (a skull and crossbones with a straw hat), often carried by protesters, became an international symbol of the fight against oppression on social media. Tech giants and niche startups are spending increasingly colossal sums to fund the frenzied development of artificial intelligence. According to US research and advisory firm Gartner, global spending on artificial intelligence is expected to reach around $1.5 trillion in 2025 (+50% in a year) and exceed $2 trillion next year. The sector’s astronomical stock market valuations -those of US microprocessor giant Nvidia had at one point surpassed the unprecedented $5 trillion level- are, however, causing fears in the markets of a potential speculative bubble. The concerns caused by artificial intelligence were moreover fuelled by numerous examples of misinformation, accusations of copyright infringement or mass layoffs, notably at Amazon. The parents of a teenager in California who committed suicide even accused OpenAI’s AI assistant ChatGPT of encouraging their child’s suicide with specific advice. Since then, the startup has stepped up parental controls, and California has enacted legislation that regulates so-called “chatbots.” On October 19, thugs in workmen’s vests broke into the famous Parisian Louvre museum in broad daylight, using a lift normally used for removals, after breaking a glass panel. They then broke into exhibit windows and stole crown jewels, estimated to be worth 88 million euros, all within eight minutes. Escaping on a scooter, they dropped the crown of Empress Eugenia (wife of Napoleon III), which was found damaged. This spectacular burglary at the Louvre was commented on around the world and brought to light the security failings of the world’s most famous museum. Charges have been laid against four men suspected of being part of the burglary group, but no loot has been found so far. Washington has deployed a significant military force off Venezuela since August, officially to combat drug smuggling destined for the United States. A series of strikes have been carried out in recent weeks in the Caribbean and Pacific against vessels suspected of carrying drugs, causing the deaths of about 100 people in operations whose legality is questioned by experts. Caracas sees this as a pretext aimed at overthrowing President Nicolas Maduro and seizing the country’s oil reserves. After arresting an oil tanker carrying Venezuelan crude on December 10, Washington announced a “complete blockade” of “sanctioned oil tankers” that sail to or from Venezuela. Washington accuses Nicolas Maduro of heading a cartel and offers a $50 million reward for his capture. Killer floods, severe storms. Extreme weather events have succeeded one another, with their frequency and intensity increasing due to climate deregulation caused by human activity, according to scientists. Cyclone Melissa, one of the most powerful to ever sweep the Caribbean, devastated entire regions of Jamaica and flooded Haiti and Cuba. In Southeast Asia, the Philippines was hit in less than two months by Typhoons Ragasha, Kalmagi and Fung-wong. Vietnam was devastated by storms, floods, and landslides, while two tropical storms claimed hundreds of lives late in the year in Sri Lanka and Indonesia. As temperatures rose, forest fires intensified in Europe, and record forest acres burned during the summer. In the US, fires started by lightning caused the northern section of the famous Grand Canyon in Arizona to close in mid-July for the rest of the tourist season. Explore related questions

Title: Exclusive: Nvidia buying AI chip startup Groq’s assets for about $20 billion in largest deal on record

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/24/2025 10:01:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind Nvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup’s latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco , Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it’s “entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq’s inference technology,” without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company’s president, and other senior leaders “will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,” the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an “independent company,” led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia’s CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq’s assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said “GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.” The deal represents by far Nvidia’s largest purchase ever. The chipmaker’s biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia’s capabilities. (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it’s “entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq’s inference technology,” without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company’s president, and other senior leaders “will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,” the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an “independent company,” led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia’s CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq’s assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said “GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.” The deal represents by far Nvidia’s largest purchase ever. The chipmaker’s biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia’s capabilities. (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

Title: The best video essays of 2025 | Sight and Sound
URL: https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/polls/best-video-essays-2025
Time Published: 2025-12-25T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
Now in its ninth year, our annual poll showcases 255 vital video essays, nominated by 72 international voters. The ninth instalment of Sight and Sound’s dedicated poll has brought a record number of participants (72) and video essays (255) mentioned. While the video essay form still escapes definition, and is no longer new or ‘the next big thing’, this data attests that the number and diversity of stakeholders willing to engage with it – creators, critics, scholars, curators, programmers, fans – continues to grow. This year’s poll has moved somewhat closer to parity between three major ecosystems of video essays: (1) academia and film/media criticism (34 voters, 94 distinct video essays mentioned), (2) festivals, museums, and galleries (17 voters, 65 essays mentioned), and (3) social media and YouTube (21 voters, 96 essays mentioned). Perhaps not surprisingly, there is little overlap in what each ecosystem mentions, except among contributors working across more than one sphere. A more interesting question raised by the poll is: which essays get seen and awarded prestige within these circles, by whom, and in what contexts? One of the key concerns resonating across the fields is accessibility. Many contributors emphasised that it was simply impossible to keep up with the gargantuan number of essays screened or published throughout the year. Others argued that seven choices were too few and applied selective parameters, such as not voting for video essays that weren’t published or available online. Such rules, while perfectly justifiable for academia, would make little sense for the art world, since online availability is a no-go for most major festival committees. Moreover, being published online in a respected peer-reviewed journal doesn’t guarantee visibility. Even the most successful scholarly video essays in this poll have relatively low view numbers. We may attribute this to increasing specialisation and fragmentation, the decline of Vimeo (still the main platform for videographic criticism), and a general lack of time and energy amid today’s precarious ‘dark academia’. Yet in the world of YouTube, these numbers would likely prevent voters from even considering such works. In this environment of overabundance, uneven availability, and dispersed notions of quality, we naturally gravitate towards what is closest: an essay encountered at a workshop or festival, one tied to a project we follow, or one that surfaces in our personalised feeds. This approach is, given the circumstances, perfectly understandable – some may even call it a survival strategy. But we should also consider whether this economy of personal connections, chance encounters, and algorithmic offerings sacrifices something essential: debate within a shared context. Within each of the three ecosystems, several trends emerge. In the academic/critical sphere, interest in archival and historiographic approaches continues to grow, building on 2024. As voter Alison Peirse notes, ‘videographic criticism is feeling its archival fantasy’. Definitions of what qualifies as archival may vary, but such works were among this year’s most frequently cited. These include the poll’s most-voted essay, The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková (12 votes), and the special issue ‘Audiovisual Approaches and the Archive’ edited by John Gibbs for the journal Movie (11 votes across three essays). One might also argue that another popular special issue, ‘The Personal Mediascape in the Age of Videographic Heterotopias’ edited by Joel Burges and Allison Cooper (11 votes across five essays), carries certain archival inflections. Horror remains a favoured genre, with Peirse herself functioning almost as an archivist of horror tropes (gaining 7 votes across her works), and Lucy Fife Donaldson’s (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly, published in the Monstrum special issue ‘Queer/ing Horror’ (ed. Dayna McLeod), receiving 6 votes. Within the art circuit, several voters stressed the importance of where video essays are watched. Dmitry Frolov, echoing Julian Ross’s categorisation ‘essay films = video essays’, argues that cinemas and contemporary art spaces offer ‘a more immersive encounter with essayistic thought’ – an encounter he sees as increasingly difficult, and thus ‘all the more precious’, in a world ‘whose condition increasingly resembles a catastrophe’. The most-voted work in this ecosystem, Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory (6 votes), exemplifies this immersive experience, and speaks to Tafakory’s enduring cross-sector appeal despite her films often remaining offline years after their premieres. Frolov’s sense of catastrophe also resonates with the prominence of works focusing on Palestine, notably happiness by Fırat Yücel and The Flowers Stand Silently, Witnessing by Theo Panagopoulos. On YouTube, the works receiving the most recognition were those tackling pressing contemporary issues in a critical yet highly personal mode. Greater self-reflexivity may echo what Jacob Geller calls a generational shift from earlier YouTubers ‘inspired by film, television, and/or written essays’ to a younger cohort that ‘grew up alongside the video essay’ and now pushes its boundaries. Nonetheless, among the poll’s selections, this self-awareness clearly spans generations. A shared focus on the politics of visibility links works as varied as Lily Alexandre’s Trans Day of Vanishing (6 votes), josh (with parentheses)’s You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) (6 votes), and Big Joel’s You Are into Mousetrap YouTube (4 votes). Josh’s piece in particular illustrates a wider YouTube trend of scrutinising AI models, especially ChatGPT, and their growing presence in daily life. Despite such weighty subjects, Denis Kefallinos notes a concurrent wave of ‘borderline comedy essays,’ which ‘mess with tone’ and toy with ‘absurd subject matter and harsh delivery’ – showing that this self-awareness trend takes many forms. Finally, some quick notes about the distribution of the voters themselves. Of the 72 contributors, 46 were male, 22 female, and 4 non-binary. This imbalance occurred despite our best intentions, yet it doesn’t deviate from the patterns of previous years. The results suggest that it didn’t carry over into any dramatic bias: among the nine most-voted video essays, six were created or co-created by women, many of which feature explicitly feminist, queer, or trans perspectives. As for demographics, the overwhelming majority of voters still come from the global centre, particularly the Anglo-American sphere (the United States leading with 24, followed by the UK with 13 and Canada with 5). Unfortunately, this reflects both the distribution of videographic practice across the world and its capacity to be disseminated in English and presented on prestigious platforms. The participation of experts from semi-peripheral regions (the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Romania) and countries outside the Euro-American sphere (Iran, Mexico) offers a glimmer of hope, as does the presence of numerous non-English video essays in the poll. Given the breadth of the poll, any selection is inevitably just a cross-section, and in this spirit we’ve selected some notable entries before granting readers the opportunity to dive into the full list and accompanying commentary from our voters. The final results are based on confidentially submitted ballots, all of which are available below. Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková, as a duo, are often mentioned in the poll and contribute greatly to the videographic community, both as creators and archaeologists of the practice. Once again, they seized a popular (and ephemeral) feature of our shared videographic histories to ask “What kind of artefact, if any, is the star wipe?” (Byron Davies), with the whimsical style and acute analysis that characterise their work. Co-winner of the 2025 Marienbad Film Festival’s Audiovisual Essay Competition, this video essay establishes “videographic form as a queer methodology” (Catherine Grant). Formally and discursively, this work succeeds in conveying a “disorienting sense of foreboding made eerie and uncanny through repetition of sound and image” (Dayna McLeod). “Films are carried by the hands of their lovers [through history]; by their shadows” (Amin Komijani and Kasra Karbasi). Awarded as one of the two winners at Marienbad this year, this video essay prolongs Varda’s gesture with finesse and an intimate understanding of the filmmaker’s work. This subtlety takes the form of a voice, that of the videast’s child, and their affectionate dialogue resonating from within the images, inside the images. The impressive Trans Day of Vanishing produces “a raw examination of visibility, vulnerability, and safety” (Denis Kefallinos) as a trans person in public space. Filming outdoors, dissecting surveillance apparatuses, vlogging in the dark, the videast subverts YouTube’s usual codes in favour of an uncanniness that turns our gaze back on us – and makes us anxiously look over our shoulder. Addressing a contemporary concern, this video proposes a way to move beyond moral, cognitive or even political positions criticising the use of LLMs. The argument is simple but deeply potent: “the purpose of writing is to meet with another person” (OutOfCharacters), to communicate. And the way of formulating it, using desktop narration, a format that YouTube’s algorithm doesn’t really like (Queline Meadows), is in line with the principle set out in the video: why not just give it a try, someone might be watching. In Tafakory’s new essay, “we are simultaneously seeing the prison bars and the freedom that the palimpsest points to” (Carlos Natálio). This videographic palimpsest superimposes flowers immortalised by cinema, collected in post-revolution Iranian films she features in all of her works, with ancient manuscripts and their flourishing illuminations. This desktop diary observes “the mediality of the Palestinian genocide, [and proposes] a meditation on what it truly means to witness a live-streamed genocide” (Flavia Dima), questioning the circulation of these images between networks, screens and bodies. How does one incorporate a constant flux of violence and impotence?

Petri Pillar of Garbage Julian Ross Jemma Saunders Dan Schindel Daniel Simpson (Eyebrow Cinema) Shannon Strucci Scout Tafoya Max Tohline César Ustarroz Ilinca Vanau Jiří Žák Barbara Zecchi Fiction writer, video essayist (as SolidArf) & English Professor at Quinnipiac University I revisit Ander Monson’s Essay as Hack often: “I fear for the essay, friends, and its bad reputation.” To me, video essays represent the best of what he considers ‘hacks’ – quirky, audiovisual experiments we keep Frankensteining together to revitalise a genre of writing that students have been taught to fear. What students forget is that essays aren’t just a genre of writing. They’re a genre of thought. The video essay is a flexible medium, one that grants a creator the chance to collage home video, guerrilla filmmaking, docupoetics, play, and personal narrative to land at a thesis that is both deeply specific and widely enlightening. What feels particularly urgent about the medium in 2025 is how it continues to put the human front-and-centre in the essay. My favourites of the year leaned into the idiosyncrasies of human thought. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) It is a truth universally acknowledged that every institution of higher ed in 2025 must be in want of an AI policy. Geist, an educator, has clearly been in dozens of mandatory meetings about this. But he’s interested in something beyond the policy level: Here, he talks to (and about) students in the language of students. The entire essay is a recording of a screen where new popups and windows push and overlap, talking to each other and singing over each other; harmonising into an impassioned defence of recombinant writing. But that remixing, he shows us, is most interesting when it’s deliberate and from the heart. Every meme, reference, and literary allusion he uses has a point. Throughout, he is also talking to ChatGPT. Can Gen-AI have a point? When? When not? Equal parts sincere, thoughtful, and inspiring, Geist’s video is a masterclass in play as pedagogy. The Unforgivable Sin of Ms Rachel by Lindsay Ellis Lindsay Ellis’s latest – which appropriately doubles as a fundraiser for the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund – is the most cohesive multi-hour video essay epic I’ve seen. She uses the story of children’s YouTuber and educator Ms. Rachel as a starting point: to discuss history, religion, geopolitics, film and entertainment, language, and the current US administration’s ‘war on empathy’. What do we do in the face of all that? What do we do in the face of death tolls measured in almost-incomprehensible numbers? Ellis has always been a forerunner in the space, but what is so exceptional about the piece is that she never loses sight of what Ms. Rachel (and other prominent children’s entertainment pioneers throughout history) represent in this context. Social and emotional learning begins at home, after all. What lessons have we taken away? What do we impart to our kids? Fantasies of Nuremberg by Jacob Geller What happens when we reduce an entire history – conflicts, controversies, contradictions, context – into a singular historical ‘event?’ This is where Jacob Geller begins with his research on the Nuremberg trials. What follows is one of his most comprehensive, well-written, and well-researched essays to date. But hanging over that research, and over his litany of primary sources, is a deep vulnerability. Geller demonstrates – both through his writing and through some visceral editing choices – that it is tempting to fantasise about justice and consequence. He wrestles with that temptation as he speaks. He tempts us too. But in our present moment, do those fantasies mean anything? The answer he lands on is not surprising. But it is necessary, and framed with the gravitas and call to further introspection that Geller always inspires. Bluey Is Perfect, And That Terrifies Me by MML’s Commentaries Prior to watching this, I had a passing understanding of the cultural phenomenon that is Bluey. I knew some younger relatives who watched it, I knew I had friends in their 30s who were (for whatever reason) mesmerised by it, and I knew my spouse – a developmental psychologist – really appreciated what it was doing in the children’s entertainment space. I watched this over a long evening with her. MML’s Commentaries illuminated many of the ‘whys’ for me. But I didn’t just learn about the creative choices that make up Bluey or why it has such a refreshing level of trust in the kids who tune in. I saw, with fresh eyes, how kids’ media looks differently to us in our 30s and up. I saw the anxieties that can arise from that. I saw MML’s Commentaries put a refreshing level of trust into us, as viewers, too. Etched into this video is a family saga, a love story, and a heartfelt dialogue between the real and the imagined. Solarpunk: When Your Ideology Is Pictures by Sam Kern (Afterthoughts) I first encountered Sam Kern’s work through videos on gaming UX / UI. More recently, she’s been working on the Change-Makers series on activism and organising. All in all, there are few essayists better equipped to analyse the various rifts between aesthetics and practice. The solarpunk movement – or rather, aesthetic – seems ripe for exactly that analysis. Kern picks out and examines an astonishing repository of solarpunk illustrations, videos, and (arguably) photographs. These images look good; idyllic even. But do they sound good? Are they saying enough to ‘sound’ at all? It would be easy to critique the genre and land on a conclusion that gives way to doomerism, but that’s not what Kern does here. Her video is a new solarpunk: one that doesn’t just imagine a brighter future, but is honest about what it’ll take to get there. The Space Truck Sim Where You’re Doomed to Fail by LambHoot There is a moment in LambHoot’s video that made me feel physically ill – and it’s not just because the subject matter is Star Trucker, a truck simulator in space (a video game premise that sounds like my personal hell). It’s because LambHoot describes his gameplay experience in such sharp, vivid terms. The world of Star Trucker is a capitalist hell where every minute you do not spend working – even if it’s to take care of your own wellbeing – is a minute wasted. There is a price tag on everything. There is a price tag on air. As with any other LambHoot piece, this is of course not just about Star Trucker. It is about how we synonymise self-worth with work. It is about the anxiety of opportunity cost. It is about the economy of how we spend our free time – and who gets to enjoy free time with dignity. Professor of Film, Television & Digital Media and Design Media Arts at UCLA As a creator and scholar who has been teaching and advocating for evolved modes of scholarly expression for many years, I embrace a broader range of videographic and multimodal scholarship than is reflected in the nominations included here. However, each of the works I have selected shares a reflective relationship to its chosen medium, often including formal experimentation but always making explicit and distinctive use of affordances that are specific to the videographic medium. Animation in London/Matchmove in Bangalore: Territorial Profiles of Visual Effects (VFX) Workforces in the Global Media Industries by Suryansu Guha Richly illustrated and densely narrated, this video is based on deep, original field research that makes a convincing argument in opposition to conventional wisdom about the (lack of) ‘creativity’ associated with visual effects that are commonly outsourced to the Global South. Mapping Roma by Jessica Wax-Edwards A sometimes playful and often idiosyncratic exploration of space and memory using marketing materials from Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma (2018), overlaying footage from the film with vernacular video captured by the creator, revisiting and reflecting on the construction of memory spaces both within and outside the diegesis of Cuarón’s film. (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson Experimental use of videographic effects interwoven with text-based analysis that re-envisions cinematic landscapes and aerial scenery; a highly effective use of videographic affordances for engaging the concept of queering cinematic form. The Chemistry of Character in Breaking Bad by Jason Mittell A first-of-its-kind videographic book that offers a groundbreaking intervention in the field of videographic criticism, demonstrating the author’s virtuosic range of critical styles, modes and voices in conjunction with incisive commentary analysing the complexity of long-form, serial character development on an iconic TV series. Media scholar, video essayist, and archivist (Queen Mary University of London & Národní filmový archiv) The Holes We Left Behind by Jacob Smith This video essay, published in the archive-oriented dossier of Movie (edited by John Gibbs), is exemplary in its revelation of intricate economic and environmental issues within a single film. Its focal point is Breaking Away (1979), a coming-of-age movie set in Indianapolis that, in the part where I come from, is almost unknown. Combining scenes from the film with archival footage and a skillful argumentative voice-over, Smith reframes the movie through the lens of real-life workers in the limestone industry. The film’s rumination on generational conflict and shifting economic realities is minimalistically yet powerfully confronted with the archive effect of slowly disappearing historical images and the deep time of geology. Bomba Bernal by Khavn de la Cruz Thanks to César Ustarroz from Found Footage Magazine, I finally saw a film by this extravagant genius of Filipino avant-garde cinema. Bomba Bernal is a sarcastic, often uncompromising look at the bomba genre – a wave of lowbrow Filipino erotic films that experienced its heyday from the late 1960s to the 1980s – yet at the same time it summons its ghosts to reveal, in its deteriorating hints of a potential social liberation, a distinctive charm. Rarely is this ambivalence expressed so cleverly and amusingly, owing to inspiration from Filipino film critic Ishmael Bernal as well as collage-like editing and sound design based on cheap-sounding local appropriations of popular music mainstays. Move on Down: Precarity in Contemporary Hungarian Cinema by László Strausz It is a real shame that there are still so few video essays about East-Central European cinema, especially about contemporary work. That is why I was so pleased that this remarkably detailed and well-researched 20-minute piece was published in Iluminace. Strausz’s work foregrounds the depiction of precarity in Hungarian cinema after the fall of the Communist regime, which triggered tectonic social transformations and widespread instability. Narrated and formally structured in a deliberately non-flamboyant manner, it very effectively argues for the role of class in shaping patterns of representation. It also offers thought-provoking reflections on embodied and accented modes of scholarship. Crochet is Sick! by Alison Peirse Even though I have recently preferred ambitious, sprawling video essays, that doesn’t mean I underestimate the value of simplicity done right. Peirse’s rhythmic, briskly cut video on the ambiguous function of crochets in horror movies neatly wraps up everything it wants to say in under four minutes, testifying to the ability to express central genre tensions through such a simple, workaday object: a source of comfort becoming a source of dread. For what is essentially a supercut, the essay includes self-reflexive moments that not only situate Peirse’s fascination but also, in a particularly infectious way, invite us to share the world of horror crochets with her. Baby It’s You (Lucy Dacus Edit) by Ian Garwood Much like Jacob Smith’s video essay mentioned earlier, Garwood’s work was an invitation for me to watch a forgotten film I hadn’t known – and again it was a coming-of-age story. Baby It’s You (1983) may resemble the 1950s-nostalgia films typical of its era, yet it is also suffused with sadness and unresolved class conflict. Garwood explores this mixture paradoxically by retelling the film – especially the arc of its lead female character – through the sensibility of vidding and fan-made music videos. Although I have never been drawn to Lucy Dacus’s music, within this jukebox-like collage everything suddenly made sense. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee Despite finding myself in the position of co-coordinating this poll with the essay’s author, I didn’t want to lose the opportunity to mention Lee’s long-awaited feature-length desktop documentary. Having engaged with this mode of video essay–making both theoretically and practically for quite a few years, I was still struck by how meticulously Lee weaves together the multifarious images of unspeakable violence we encounter in the online world and beyond. The documentary reminds us that the desktop experience isn’t just about wonder and gratification but, nowadays perhaps more often, about fatigue, numbness, even horror. Best viewed in tandem with Neta Alexander’s newest book Interface Frictions. Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant Also published in the archival dossier of Movie, Bell and Grant’s work on the not-always-visible art of script supervising reminded me of the value of rewatching video essays in different contexts. Clocking in at almost 33 minutes, I initially found it difficult to watch because of its repetitive style. Yet after seeing it on a big screen (twice!), I got it. It takes a deliberate mode of attention to let the almost parametric multi-screen structure sink in and to appreciate the storytelling of script supervisor Penny Eyles. The video is highly recommended for anyone interested in how oral history can be translated into a videographic form. Video maker and media scholar at Tel Aviv University In alphabetical order: 100 Years of History in 100 Films by kaptainkristian A skillfully-edited journey across a hundred years of history – both real and fictional – through the eyes of cinema. Images of the past, depicted mostly by later films, eventually give way to futuristic visions of the present as imagined by the cinema of the past. It does not end well. F. W. Murnau’s ‘Sunrise’: A Mystic Writing Pad by Cristina Álvarez López Incredible. Insightful. Inspired. I couldn’t do it justice by describing what it does in words. Just watch it. And read Cristina’s own words. I Can Hear Someone Coming by Alison Peirse Published as part of Queer/ing Horror: Video Essays at the Intersection of Horror and Queerness, edited by Dayna McLeod for Monstrum, this video offers a hilariously subversive take on the queer potentialities of 1930s horror. Fabulous. Miradas by Pablo Serrano Torres Produced for the 2023 Embodying the Video Essay workshop at Bowdoin College and later published at [in]Transition, this is a playful, touching, and beautifully vulnerable reflection on queerness, identity, embodiment, and collaboration. Call me a sucker for any video essay that features footage of video essayists doing karaoke. Panorama of Western State Penitentiary by Eli Boonin-Vail And I’m equally a sucker for any video essay that opens with dictionary definitions. Drawing on footage from a diverse range of sources – archival and contemporary, documentary and fiction, found and original – this video reflects on and problematises our voyeuristic fascination with prisons as sites of surveillance, spectacle, and tourism. Sebastián Leilo’s Two Glorias – Aging in Translation by Barbara Zecchi A comparative analysis of a Chilean film and its English-language remake, this highly affective piece makes brilliant use of the multiscreen format to explore issues of age, gender, and transcultural adaptation. Terrific. The Disturbing Current: Three-Shots in The Awful Truth by Joel Blackledge A wonderful examination of how staging, blocking, and framing are used to great dramatic and comedic effect in Leo McCarey’s The Awful Truth. The video employs an ideally suited, frustratingly simple formal device of the ‘I wish I’d thought of that!’ variety. Spot on. Video essayist, editor, and semiotician; Intermediality MSc student at the University of Edinburgh Grand Theft Auto Is Killing Everything by chriswaves A meta take on the talking-head style of video essays and commentary videos, chriswaves applies a frenetic analysis with hyper-intentional editing. Clips are sequenced and overlayed in a way that supplement and supersede the spoken points he makes about the meaning of mediums and the state of the creator economy in the middle of this decade. HOT TO GO! by Cǎlin Husar There is no shortage of studies queering David Lynch’s body of work, and Cǎlin Husar’s analysis of Eraserhead is solid. Husar contrasts Lynch’s debut with one of the most iconic, joyous queer anthems of recent memory to elucidate Eraserhead’s themes of heteronormative pressures to perform, parent, plus resultant anxiety. “Interpretation” (or “Me (or, “Me (or, Me”)”)”) by JerryTerry The final boss of meta-interpretation, this video is a rat king of essays in 2025. It starts out (as an introspection of) analysing video game Signalis and its fan discourse, exploring the notion of generative interpretation as its own artistic expression. Kaleidoscopically tumbling outward into meta-layers of meta-layers, it can get a bit hard to parse, but is ultimately a meditation on creating online, interpreting online, the self-observation that comes in both activities, and their interweaving. red dead redemption 2 is still a vibe by orangewall An anthology of three mini-essays about videogame aesthetics and the sequel to rockstar’s epic western. orangewall’s own visual style is striking, directly filming old monitors displaying relevant gameplay and video sources to create comforting, retro feel. It continues into the writing, too, with a general similarity to mainstream video essays of the late 2010s, just sharper. There Are No More Normal Guys by Jack Saint Ah, the infamous t-word. or x-word. That site everyone used to use. Jack Saint observes, from afar, a viral spat over misunderstandings of masculine norms, before an extrapolation. Normal guys no longer become normal online: if they aren’t subject to outrage, they’re deified. Jack overlays news coverage in audio and video forms deftly, in between spoken commentary. His synthesis of modes examine these two extremes with case studies in respect to minor online spectacles and major news events. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) A fantastic screen-trawling odyssey across the perforations of AI across contemporary culture. josh (with parentheses) uniquely compares and contrasts video and audio sources within the diegetic space of a mac desktop. It’s reminiscent of Occitane Lacurie’s doc from last year’s poll, xena’s body (a menstrual auto-investigation using an iPhone). What is the state of writing, and writing online, now? Especially in a time of post-plagiarism super-awareness, of large-language model dupes, and dupes of dupes, of concern, of hyperreality. Josh answers the call. Media scholar, bricoleur It was a very difficult year and it seems that my picks seem to reflect some of the pain and loss it held. Once again, I become aware of how video essays for me are not just a way to think, but a way to exist. These video essays and the people who made them (and so many more I couldn’t mention here) make me want to go on. Sticky by Maria Hofmann What does it mean to witness? How do we watch the unwatchable? The Anthropocene Will Eat Itself by Cormac Donnelly The apocalypse is coming to a screen near you. The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell A scholar is analysing a series by playing a scholar who analyses a series and makes a video essay series about it. Mise-en-abyme is Jason Mittell’s middle name. Age Perfect by Dayna McLeod Once again, Dayna is hitting you like a splash of cold water. Right in the face of a consumer society so obsessed with policing the aging female body. I am wide awake again. Look at Me by Alison Peirse These piercing gazes. They hit me in the blink of an eye. Caught in the Dream of the Other by Cristina Álvarez López & Adrian Martin The mirror is a trap. And a portal. You won’t come out of it unchanged. Line Drawings by Joseph Popper The dotted line – a fragile, fractured umbilical cord connecting us to the outer space. There is something strangely relieving in knowing how easily we can become untethered. Curator of Film and Video for e-flux Narrative by Anocha Suwichakornpong The self-reflective work reveals how political trauma moves like a spirit through people’s lives, unsettling what one sees, hears, and remembers, and how film can become a tool for seeking justice and healing. You Won’t Feel a Thing by Hiwa K. Emotionally impactful film calls into question the marginalization of Indigenous forms of knowledge and healthcare by the corporate interests of Western medicine through the masterful use of film essay style. Slet 1988 by Marta Popivoda A masterful combination of the archival footage and documentary to reflect on the specters of history. Experimental / Essay Filmmaker, Poet, Exceptional Man / Average Pisces I am attracted to poetic video essays; non-traditional, humorous, experimental videographic works. My choices tend to bend the definition of what a video essay is… but I believe in the inclusive nature of the form. So, here goes: Frontier by Brunella Tedesco-Barlocco An elegant meditation on the culture of cowboys and cinema, with a hand-lettered feel. Transformed clips of relevant movies enrich the understanding of the author’s thesis. The whole video has a slowness about it and a lulling sound design that I found refreshing. Paul Schrader on The Florida Project by James Whale Bake Sale Wise old sage Paul Schrader appraises the anecdotal nature of Sean Baker’s film in a nicely cut together videographic piece by stalwart YouTuber James Whale Bake Sale. As a Floridian myself, I appreciated the embodied representation of colours that define my state and a revisit to a film I saw before I ever found myself living there. The Thinking Machine #94: Shot Missing by Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin This is the most ‘Los Angeles’ video essay this side of Thom Andersen. I have been an admirer of the trope where you juxtapose two similar films in one videographic work. I’ve done it in my own art practice and I admire how it was done here. I had never heard of the film by Abel Ferrara, but sure enough it deserves a comparison to Lynch’s Lost Highway. Clever associations abound, but there is also a sustained and unified mood that makes the two films seem as one; surely the ultimate purpose behind such an exploration. Writer; overseeing the research and documentation at the Centre Pompidou film collection Three encounters in three different contexts: a cinema; an exhibition; my phone. Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat by Johan Grimonprez A reused footage fresco on the geopolitical (and musical) context that led to the assassination of Patrice Lumumba in 1961. This montage of archival material is devoid of accompanying voiceover, instead its textual elements are either to be read on screen (provided with bibliographical footnotes) or heard as direct quotations read aloud on the soundtrack. Distributed theatrically in France in the fall of 2025, I was able to watch it on a monumental-sized screen. The magnifying effect on many of the low-resolution transfers is one of the work’s compelling aspects. Mais perto de você [Closer to You] by Isadora Soares Belletti Saw it as an installation in the collective exhibition L’art et la vie et inversement at Beaux-Arts de Paris in March 2025. The young Brazilian artist, based in France, made this video portrait of her watching the sunset in Belo Horizonte, her hometown in Brasil, next to her grandmother, Teresinha Soares. Journal or essay? It is an attempt to record a casual moment – a fleeting conversation, ordering take-out food – with a studied insistence on the first-person account (via the hand-held camera capturing the sun from the balcony). Secret des stars: Bella Hadid by Dr Chloé Mathez-Loïc Chloé Mathez-Loïc appeared in my Instagram feed with one reel about the surgical secrets behind Bella Hadid’s face. This one video was posted on her account, in collaboration with Forever Institut (apparently the first centre of cosmetic medicine in Switzerland), and openly inscribed itself in the vein of the ‘Secret de stars’ content, popular on TikTok. It appears she published only three reels so far: a similar one on Kylie Jenner, and an interview in which she answers some questions about her work and personal hobbies. The format is canonical in its kind: Dr Mathez-Loïc looks at a photo on her phone and comments on surgical techniques used to achieve certain effects on the given public persona, while the viewer sees a picture in the foreground. The content is informative, but it is her calmness, off-pace in the realm of reels, as if oblivious of its destination, and a bordering-humour detachment, that makes her reel more intriguing than the ones by her online peers. Webby Award-winning video essayist, writer, and producer I’ve been making video essays for over 14 years. Work-Life Balance • A Podcastèsque Video Essay by Melis Altınso and Ceyda Ece Akköse This is what the sociology of cinema should aim at; challenging the everyday norms with curiosity and acidic wit. Nebulous Encounters by Catherine Grant Anytime a creator can effectively juxtapose two moving images to the point where it captivates me, it is a success. Grant understands how our eyes and hearts talk to the screen. The Pulse by Catherine Salnikova If These Walls Could Talk: The Shining Video Essay Clipse — Let God Sort Em Out (Official Album Trailer) by Clipse Clipse have possibly made the best music album of 2025, and in their promotion leading up to its release, have given the world the year’s best video mashup. Professor of Cinema Studies, Savannah College of Art and Design My video essay viewing this year has been shaped by my preparation for teaching a course on the subject. I’ve been drawn to videos that exemplify successful audiovisual applications of cinema studies methods and arguments, and I think these three will provide great examples and fodder for discussion. The Hand That Touches the Arm by Calac Nogueira This video assembles an impressive number and variety of film clips that convey a very specific gesture – the assistive touch (usually by a man) of another person (usually a woman) on the arm or elbow. This common action is wonderfully defamiliarised via the supercut, revealing a hidden lexicon that is open to interpretation. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková This video essay is both delightful and substantive. It manages to offer a history and theory of the star wipe as a cultural artefact (you never knew you needed this, but you do!), exploring and embodying the star wipe’s playful impudence that resonates well beyond nostalgia. This video essay beautifully exemplifies the audiovisual and essayistic potentials of a media archaeology methodology. The Water Diaries, or My Letter to Jane by Chiara Grizzaffi Chiara Grizzaffi’s decision to frame this video as a letter to Jane [Campion] is an inspired appropriation, resulting in a work that is both playful and sincere. Her voice-over is so engaging – rich in essayistic potential as it weaves together personal narrative with pressing questions about the larger world, anchored in the possibilities of feminist theory. I would love to see a version of this video that actually uses footage from Campion’s films, but I realise that wasn’t within the constraints of the assignment. Curator, writer Zifzafa by Lawrence Abu Hamdan At once imaginative, beautiful, and incensed. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory The essay form as dissolved into narrative. Partition by Diana Allan Smart, righteous, and lucid work. Creator of Be Kind Rewind, a YouTube channel that explores film history. A Man Like My Aunt: Community and Desire in Working Girls by Kallan Benjamin Benjamin thoroughly analyses the opening sequences of Dorothy Arzner’s Working Girls to explore how a working class women’s boarding house functions as a communal space that exists outside of patriarchy, heterosexuality, and the workplace. It’s a true pleasure to see Arzner’s work receive such detailed attention. Technology Isn’t Fun Anymore by Drew Gooden In this video, Drew Gooden articulates the casual frustrations foisted upon consumers by endless mergers, acquisitions, and content wars waged by major corporations. Seemingly no one, he points out, seeks to materially improve the collective user experience. Why can’t you watch your local basketball team on television? Why does an app that turns lights on and off have a social media component? Everything is a nightmare; at least Gooden can help us laugh about it. HELLO? by Alison Peirse Landline phones play a significant role in slasher films. Women answer in fear, hang up in haste, and shudder in anticipation of violence. Peirse imagines alternative (better) futures for these characters. Solidarity finds the final girls. Researcher in film and philosophy. Member of the film exhibition and programming collective Salón de Cines Múltiples (SACIMU) in Oaxaca, Mexico Piel de toro muerto by Aroldo Murguia It’s fitting to begin with a bold statement about the origin and nature of cinema, emerging from the South. In an overpowering mixture of Super 8 footage and digital photogrammetry, flickers and rotations, as well as cyanotypes, rotoscoping, and frottage, Peruvian filmmaker and programmer Aroldo Murguia declares the ancient Toro Muerto petroglyphs in the Arequipa region of Peru, marked by continuous sequences of animals in movement, to be the site where cinema was invented thousands of years ago. The claim rests somewhat less on the petroglyphs’ age in comparison with European sites that have invited similar speculations (such as the Copper Age rock carvings at Valcamonica with which Jonathan Walley begins his book Cinema Expanded) than on the tangible passage of time constituting Murguia’s audiovisual argument: incarnating, rather than simply hypothesising, the place of cinema’s invention. This is an argument backed by a firm command of metaphors – “El cine es una serpiente que constantemente cambia de piel” (“Cinema is a snake that constantly sheds its skin”), he says in an opening title – and Murguia is indeed demonstrating a protocinema (an ‘ancestor’ of cinema, in Juan Camilo Martínez’s description) apt to be recognised as such under present mutations in the digital age. Accompanying the film’s premiere this year in the ‘Umbrales’ experimental section of the FICUNAM festival in Mexico City was a brilliant catalogue statement by Murguia locating the matter of cinema, and not just its idea, in early 20th-century ‘sololoy’ (celluloid) dolls in Mexico, thus placing Piel de toro muerto, for all that it sensorily inherits from the wider cosmos, at the level of fragile toys – as he says, in a cinema of “sololoy”. Mahmoud Darwish: In the Presence of Absence by Maryam Tafakory “Time was less defiant than now”, reads Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish in his 2005 poem ‘Tabāq’ (‘Antithesis’), memorialising Edward Said and recalling their first meeting in New York 30 years earlier. Tafakory’s uncanny work conjoins a video from that same year of Darwish reading ‘Antithesis’ in Ramallah – a recording that continues its errant passage around the internet (as of this writing it appears to have been removed from YouTube) – with a letter from Mohamad Golabi explaining the unguent that the same poem provided him while recovering in a hospital in New York. I saw this work in another Western capital, Lisbon, in the excellent two-part film programme curated by Cristina Hadwa and Raquel Schefer, Trojan Cinema: Spectral Archives of Palestine, which foregrounded Darwish’s self-definition as a ‘Trojan poet’, in search of the voices of the defeated (in ‘Antithesis’ identified with Said: “the last epic hero / defending the right of Troy / to share the narrative”). Video essay conventions of blackness surrounding a split screen offer something like the enveloping comfort that Golabi ascribes to Darwish’s words, which for him helped to render the impossible less ‘distant’. The poem’s title of ‘Antithesis’ then covers not only the split screen, or the epistolary connection between Golabi and Tafakory, or the friendship between Darwish and Said, but also Darwish’s expression of the vanities of pleading for an oppressor’s understanding, even under fantasies of parity: “Had my sword / been larger than my rose, would you / have asked if I would have acted like you?” The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková The gentle, welcoming touches of this sparkling, deeply researched video only serve to accentuate its central philosophical question, one few would have thought to ask: What kind of artefact, if any, is the star wipe? Indeed, what kinds of objects are editing transitions, and how do they feature in our memory? These questions turn out to depend on classical aesthetic debates about theatricality, ostentation, and taste – permeating the video’s unironic embrace of corn and personal address – as well as the commodity status of the gimmick (as formulated by Sianne Ngai). But then, what does it mean for an editing device to symbolise doing too little (and thus ostentatiously revealing a readiness to do anything at all) to please another? Did we always know that there was such pathos in the star wipe? The question more directly addressed in this video is what would it be to touch the star wipe, something that Anger and Hanáková undertake in a didactic method of printing, cutting, and touching also used in another important video from this year, A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds. They thus in effect raise the question of how to locate the star wipe’s seemingly perfect geometry among the ‘weird shapes’ in early Czech archival footage analysed in the latter and in Anger’s book Towards a Film Theory from Below. Anger and Hanáková say that the star wipe points to paradoxes of simultaneous bewitchment and disenchantment, though in taking another look at one of their examples – George Kuchar’s Secrets of the Shadow World (1999) – and hearing Kuchar’s friend Andy Martinez sincerely describe his encounters with fairies in the mountains of Taos, New Mexico, I find myself inspired by the video to prefer to think that a world, whether diegetic or extra-diegetic, that makes space for star wipes is a significantly re-enchanted one. The Holes We Left Behind by Jacob Smith While The Return of the Star Wipe is an archaeology of media ephemerality, The Holes We Left Behind is an assertion of permanence. Together with Piel de Toro Muerto, this video is a landmark of petrocinematic criticism. Making a beautiful case for how the Hollywood coming-of-age film Breaking Away (Peter Yates, 1979) is an archive of Indiana limestone, Smith draws on eye-opening material from Bloomington Community Access Television (BCAT) and the Indiana Limestone Company. This most importantly features an interview with Harold Dugan Elgar, the real-life master stone carver who briefly appears in the original film as a former colleague of the protagonist’s father, played by Paul Dooley, who has gone from cutting stone to selling used cars (from one petro-economy to another, as Smith says). In an especially affecting moment, a cropped shot from the film of Dooley’s hand touching limestone on the Indiana University campus gives way to archival audio from BCAT narrating the formation of Indiana Limestone in the Mississippian period. Without Smith making this explicit, there is something familiar here: it might be the petro equivalent of the ‘man existing alone’ observatory speech in that other coming-of-age film invoking a planetary timescale, Rebel Without a Cause. This is an essay that – including in its use of, in its author’s words, ‘fragile’ archival video from community access TV – absolutely transmits weight. Animation in London/Matchmove in Bangalore: Territorial Profiles of Visual Effects (VFX) Workforces in the Global Media Industries by Suryansu Guha This vital and richly documented essay busts persistent myths about the geopolitics of labor in the visual effects (VFX) industry, drawing on interviews with workers in studios in India. Guha demonstrates that the proliferation of VFX in Hollywood blockbusters in the last two decades is not just the result of technology, but also of the emergence of a racialised global infrastructure, where offshore VFX studios supply a ‘standing reserve’ of labour to the Global North. But while the division of labor captured in the video’s title (Animation in London/Matchmove in Bangalore) is real, Guha argues that the myth underlying it, of matchmove and other outsourced VFX work as uncreative ‘lower-level’, ‘grunt work’ is manifestly not: precarity and racialization also mask where and among whom a great deal of the creative VFX work in fact takes place. A remarkable example of obfuscation of labor elaborated on by Guha is how the false marketing of Oppenheimer (2023) as free of CGI necessitated a sparse – and, in the end, racialised – list of end credits of only 77 VFX workers. We learn that when the British-Indian VFX studio released its own, much longer, supplementary credits for Oppenheimer, 90% named were Indian. I would like to see this research widened in order to account for the longer history of outsourcing in Hollywood, including ‘runaway’ animation and maquila animation practices in Latin America, beginning in the late 1950s. As Juan Manuel Aurrecoechea explains in his history of Mexican animation, El episodio perdido, when Rocky and Bullwinkle first aired, its principal animators in Mexico City were appalled to see their names absent from the credits, taken up only by Anglo ones. Prophets and Propaganda, or, If Faces Tire You, What Will Movies Do? by Stephen Broomer This intriguingly measured study of Ron Ormond’s 1970s Evangelical sermon films featuring Baptist preacher Estus Pirkle goes far beyond indulging in the films’ camp and anti-communist hysterics, and instead focuses on the functioning of Ormond’s closeups on Pirkle’s face. Drawing on Slavko Vorkapich’s poetics and the idea that the closeup “could disrupt the uncanny of the photoplay to serve a greater truth”, Broomer argues that Ormond uses these closeups on the preacher to “much the same end” as Vorkapich: distancing cinema from theatre. Ormond thus renders film and sermon as one, to amplifying effect: according to Broomer, repetition of the patriarch’s face becomes an effective (not just camp) vehicle of brainwashing. Viewing Prophets and Propaganda in light of The Return of the Star Wipe, I am led to ask: Is there something gimmicky about the closeup of the face that august theorising about it since the early 20th century has obscured – or perhaps sublimated? Have we learned to ignore the gimmickry of the closeup? The present-day heirs of Ormond and Pirkle in the US teach us that gimmickry and brainwashing are hardly antithetical. Digital curator, Fotomuseum Winterthur I have selected works from the field of media arts and digital cultures that connect with the genre of video essay yet experiment with its form through networked and digital properties, or where the video essay is part of a larger project – extending installations and performances usually hosted in art galleries and museums. I am interested in how the format of the video essay can extend its technical definitions and extend to a larger way of thinking, embedded in artistic projects which would not normally enter the circulation networks of video essays. A Life of Its Own: American Psycho by Sara Bezovšek A Life of Its Own is a series of experimental web-based works, large-scale wallpapers and installations by Sara Bezovšek, exploring how popular movies transform online into memes, GIFs and remixes. Focusing on culturally significant films like The Matrix, American Psycho and The Lord of the Rings, Bezovšek tracks how scenes are transformed into memetic fragments that gain a life of their own as they leave their source context and circulate online. Driven by free creative labour and network dynamics, images not only take on new meanings, but are easily repurposed for various social and political agendas. While memes from American Psycho equally critique and celebrate toxic masculinity, The Lord of the Rings is appropriated to support both right-wing and left-wing ideologies, for example. By organising the material collected from social media platforms and obscure online forums according to the films’ original plot, Bezovšek accentuates the spread of memetic content and its ability to seamlessly blend entertainment, ideologies and politics. Image Syncers by Nina Davies Nina Davies uses speculative fiction to examine the consequences of today’s ‘perception collapse’, taking as a starting point TikTok trends in which people mimic AI-generated videos. Her project Image Syncers imagines futures where AI-driven choreographies disrupt visual economies, generate alternative modes of meaning, and gesture toward communication with emerging algorithmic dimensions. The central video blends the narrative strategies of podcasts and video essays with imagery that merges AI-generated footage and performances choreographed by the artist. The world of Image Syncers extends across installations, photographic works, and live performances, forming a coherent universe in which language, images, and bodies evolve under the pervasive influence of synthetic media. Anatomy of a Non-Fact, Chapter 2: Tick Tick Tick… Boom by Martyna Marciniak Anatomy of Non-Fact is an artistic research project investigating how misinformation and information overload take shape in an era increasingly defined by post-optical imagery. The project spans different chapters and media, including a full recreation of the puffy coat generated in the now iconic AI image of the so-called ‘Balenciaga Pope’. In 2025, the second chapter of Anatomy of a Non-Fact continues the investigation started the year before, extending the study of the image of the pope to other symbols of broader visual cultures and economies. Anatomy of Non-Fact, Chapter 2: Tick Tick Tick… Boom sketches out possible futures for how visual truth might be constructed, and the effects of virality on political violence, and market instability. The video moves from a traditional essayistic form to a promotional narrative, introducing a system to generate effective ‘panic images’ to conveniently manipulate the market. Combining a critical reflection with a parodic advertisement, the project builds another layer on top of the world of manipulated images that the artist simultaneously constructs and critiques. Critic & researcher Agencia by May Santiago A deeply personal essay film that charts a new way forward for videographic criticism as it relates to not only activating the archive but working towards building new ones. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková A ground-breaking work that showcases the video essay’s potential for media archaeology, and one that charts a path forward for rediscovering and celebrating ephemera of the moving image. Air Bud Pt. II: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (Web Exclusive) by Last Week Tonight A bit of media analysis from a man and team who understand our time like no other. The World Doesn’t End When You Do by marlow magdalene A remarkable, personal work that expands our sense of what is possible with the archive. Mutineer by Scout Tafoya “By then, I’d seen a lot on TV…” Another astonishing work from a master. Cinephilia and History, or The Mystery of William Keighley by Christian Keathley An epic project, beautifully realised over many years by a scholar without whom much videographic criticism would not be made. Film critic, programmer, researcher, and translator I must confess that I’ve lagged behind a bit, this year, in terms of video essays, so this list is quite clearly open-ended (and should be taken as such). Even so – there are some gems that’ve caught my eye. Here they are: Debut, or, Objects of the Field of Debris as Currently Catalogued by Julian Castronovo Equal parts essay-film and (faux?) video essay, Castronovo’s polemic approach to the form and ingeniousness simply left me in awe upon my first viewing of it. A deeply rich text. happiness by Fırat Yücel What an effective, amazing work about the mediality of the Palestinian genocide, a meditation on what it truly means to witness a live-streamed genocide, amongst other apps and enormous quantities of digital debris – both grave and, at times, incredibly funny in its use of (self-effacing) dark humour. Being John Smith by John Smith Finally caught up with it this year. John Smith is like none other (pun intended?). Slet 1988 by Marta Popivoda Expanding upon her previous work, Popivoda does something quite incredible with the format here: she frames a video essay with auto-fictional insertions that emulate the perspective of a teenaged self. What a beautiful, playful innovation. Their Eyes by Nicolas Gourault The perspective of tech-colonialism – of outsourced labor, its gaze/regard, of the human cost that AI is constructed upon, of the new nightmarish ways that the contemporary panopticon keeps on finding to transform moving images into surveillance. Lloyd Wong, unfinished by Lesley Loksi Chan Video creator and visual content designer for YouTube How We’re Redesigning Audacity for the Future by Tantacrul Bit of a controversial choice, as this video is more of an advertisement for software the creator is promoting than a traditional video essay. Still, Tantacrul’s rhythm in editing and storytelling is something other creators can and should learn from. Controversial opinion: Norman Rockwell’s art was more than kitsch. Your thoughts?⁠⁠ by Josie Lewis One of my favourite recent short-form essays. Josie is well-versed in tackling a timely topic; challenging the kitsch nostalgia for a bygone era by revealing Norman Rockwell’s more progressive side. I Played Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 Every Day for a Month. Here’s What Happened by Static Canvas Another experimental video essay, from a creator whose work I’ve grown really fond of the past year. Tom from Static Canvas explores the summertime adventures of Boku no Natsuyasumi by writing diary entries after each play session. I love its approach to roleplaying as a form of analysis. Making Sense of ‘Dad Movies’ by In/Frame/Out I’ve been a fan of In/Frame/Out’s accessible approach to film analysis for years, and this topic is a great entry point for newcomers. It explores ‘Dadcore’ movies; what defines them and what they reveal about the audiences who love them. Delivered, as usual, in IFO’s smart writing and stylish editing. Mario Kart World’s real winner… is graphic design by elliotisacoolguy Elliot’s videos showcase many aspects of his graphic design expertise; how to create visuals across a range of unusual programs, viral design challenges, and, more importantly for this list, essays on what design communicates. In this case, he focuses on this year’s Mario Kart World and its overlooked fictional brands. blue prince is at odds with itself by Video Games Are Bad Don’t let the channel’s branding fool you; Harry’s writing cuts to the heart of what makes games great, blending genuine enthusiasm with a deep knowledge for the medium, while keeping things concise and approachable. His look at this year’s indie cult hit Blue Prince captures what his channel does best: making thoughtful arguments and exploring every interesting thread, all presented with the tone of a friendly chit-chat. How Many Times Can You Pee in Heavy Rain? by Allie Meowy My video essay of the year. Allie Meowy deserves credit for asking the question no one else would – and uncovering some fascinating insights along the way. Audiovisual essayist and Professor of Film Studies at the University of St Andrews Looking at my choices, I see that I have particularly valued work thinking through and about history, whether that is presenting marginalised histories through stories of digitisation or labour, or re-imagining personal histories and relationships to media, or speculative/revisionist approaches. Many of these pieces have made me consider the project of historical work in different ways, offering inspiration for how we might approach an archive, an institution, a role, a genre. On the formal side, I’ve chosen work that has impressed me in its audiovisual choices, and in particular, videos that have demonstrated how affective videographic form can be. All of these pieces have moved or entranced me, some have blown my mind with their skill, elegance and distinctiveness. (It turns out, multiscreens really speak to me!) As always there are simply too many pieces to choose from, so I’ve given some further recommendations in my comments. A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková and Jiří Žák Compositionally and analytically rich, A Tale of Two Desktops offers an insight into early cinema which brings novel ways of thinking about how to address aesthetic specificity, especially aesthetic qualities that might be overlooked as mistakes or limitations of technology. This work does a great deal to expand and spatialise videographic approaches to the archive, as does John Gibbs’ highly enjoyable Backlot Connections. Post-Cinema: The Hall of Mirrors by Joel Blackledge I saw Post-Cinema: The Hall of Mirrors at the Marienbad Film Festival in June, and was really swept away by the power of its central formal conceit – a moving reel of images – which delivers and builds on engagement with theory. Though very different in pace and tone, the powerful force of the compositional choice reminded me of Catherine Grant’s use of a reel of images in Making Fiction Flow (in collaboration with Melanie Bell), which presents a masterful form for engaging with archival materials (in this case oral histories). See Under: Orient by Colleen Laird Striking, insightful, playful and incisive. This is at once dazzling and sharp, combining the intense sensory pleasures of the audiovisual essay with its capacity for critical insight. As with work I most admire, it makes me see, think and feel new things every time I watch. The Hand That Touches the Arm by Calac Nogueira Palpably demonstrating the power of accumulation, this piece illuminates the critical force of selection and editing. Quietly troubling, the audience’s attention is demanded. While Nogueira gradually calls our attention to look and feel for small gestures, Barbara Zecchi commands our attention to violence against women, making her own declarative and interventionist gestures in Overturning Carmen’s feminicide: Materialising women’s agency through the musical. Meet Part | Mothers Daughters by Viktoria Paranyuk Illusive and suggestive, while being somehow dense and stark simultaneously, Paranyuk’s compositional approach repays multiple viewings. Although the piece as a whole is formally very different, the tactility and care of the editing reminds me of Johannes Binotto’s work, especially his gestures of thought – inscription, which was my favourite this year. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Shepard’s work is beautifully poised; compelling formal decisions are married with stirring personal reflection. The quality of the personal with such arresting image-making connects to Dayna McLeod’s Pot Belly, a much cheekier work, which brings with it no less force for thinking through the specificity of the maker’s relationship to a particular film. On Listening by Pavitra Sundar Sundar’s audiovisual essay stages an encounter between a scene and film history, carried through sound but masterfully conceptualised through layering and text. The power of sound, and capacity to communicate narrative and affective experience through remixing of images achieved so brilliantly here is carried further by Alison Peirse’s HELLO?, in which new generic possibilities are built. Film lecturer and researcher at Liverpool John Moores University These video essays all lingered well beyond the brief period I spent watching them. Epitaph for Sonja 1: Body/Archive/Movement by Amanda Doxtater “It was devastating and beautiful at once” which appears in this video essay and eloquently sums up how I feel about it. Age Perfect by Dayna McLeod The unlikely yet pitch perfect meeting of video essayist and waterfall. A reminder that form and method may not be found at my desk in front of my computer. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková The absolute joy of this piece belies the clarity of its argument and the amount of research which has gone into it. And I am definitely staying tuned for the ‘Home Improvement’ instalment in the series. ON BEING ’WITH’ NORMAL PEOPLE by Catherine Fowler This video essay plays so beautifully with the tension of proximity, of closeness, of being ‘with’, and then of course of being without. On Listening by Pavitra Sundar Fascinating to listen to (and watch) and consider the mediating nature of the listening experience; listening on listening on listening, and indeed listening to listening to listening. Associate Professor, Queens College/CUNY and co-editor of [in]Transition The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková This is exemplary media archaeology and a reminder of the whimsy of programming decisions. Bride of Frankenstein [film|minutes] — interactive version by Shane Denson Slowness is the antidote to a constructed life; a tool to reorganise the parts. Another Delicious Story by Karin Shankar We make images from images made by others. And sometimes they’re your kids. Giallo by Matt Miller AI bad. Code good. Sharing tools and methods is the way. The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell Form runs through the wringer. Freelance film curator, researcher, and cultural worker In assembling this list, I was guided by a principle articulated last year by my esteemed colleague Julian Ross: “Essay films = video essays.” Without denying the heuristic or aesthetic value of online videographic criticism, I chose to focus on a more immersive encounter with essayistic thought – namely, in cinemas and contemporary art spaces. In a world whose condition increasingly resembles a catastrophe, gaining access to such experiences is becoming ever more difficult (at least for me, an unemployed immigrant), and thus all the more precious. Perhaps a reaction to this same world-condition underlies the mixture of melancholy and incisive critical thinking that permeates most of the films I selected. As the literary scholar Mikhail Epstein once wrote, the essay form is marked by “uncertainty and brazenness, the sadness of an exile and the audacity of a wanderer.” Each of the five films follows this fluctuating artistic strategy in its own way, reflecting on the maladies and peculiarities of our time. Each resonates deeply with my current state of mind. Evidence by Lee Anne Schmitt If the essay’s key strength is its critical potential, then questioning contemporary power structures becomes one of its essential tasks. This film embodies that brilliantly: a brilliant, penetrating investigation of American neoconservatism. BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions by Kahlil Joseph One of the most spectacular films of 2025, together with an inventive and multifaceted reflection on contemporary Black culture. Family Constellation with a Fox by Gernot Wieland Combining a Benjaminian poetic tone, intellectual clarity, personal mythologies and wonderful ceramic figures, this work struck me as both piercing and uplifting. New Old Homeland by Taniguchi Akihiko One of the year’s best machinima essay films, offering a deep and humorous reflection on the increasingly prominent virtual worlds shaped by game engines. Hostile Landscapes by Zhang Hanwen This is a wonderful example of a slow-paced, dual-channel essay film that subtly enhances the viewer’s sense of agency. I especially appreciate the attunement between my gaze and the filmmaker’s calm exploration of a landscape beneath which lie layers of colonial history and mechanisms of power. Technologist and creator of cinematic essays who teaches coding for media studies at Columbia University and works in Technology at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Many of my nominations emerged from a course I designed and still teach at Columbia University’s School of the Arts. Nearly all of last year’s cohort had no prior knowledge of video essays or even nonlinear editing, yet they produced exceptional work that earned recognition beyond the classroom. Two of them spoke and screened their films at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, and two video essays are forthcoming in an upcoming issue of In Media Res. Their work demonstrates the medium’s capacity to function as scholarship, criticism, and art. Trapped on a Pedestal by Sam Gordon Gordon’s close visual reading of John Cassavetes’ A Woman Under the Influence is simultaneously sublime and evocative. While the ultra-widescreen is a treat for the eyes, its clever sound design shouldn’t be missed: listen with headphones. CAROL (2015): Discontinuity in the Pursuit of Jean Epstein’s Photogénie by Lily Cummings Cummings’ close examination of Todd Haynes’ 2015 film Carol with Epstein’s enigmatic Photogénie blends a cinematic style through an academic lens. Agnes’ Song by Chengkangjie (Eric) Huang How can you portray the difficult subject of ‘comfort women’ in audiovisual form? Huang succeeded in this film that is haunting, yet respectful to the survivors and their stories. Gleaning Reflection by Gracie Hecht Hecht uses both literal and metaphorical mirrors and lenses in her meditation on the reflexive mode of filmmaking employed by Agnès Varda’s The Gleaners and I (2000). Hecht was one of my students who was granted access to Varda’s archives, and invited to accompany the screening of her video essay at the Cannes Film Festival this year. (Untitled) by Committee of Affairs (CoA) The anonymous artist Committee of Affairs (CoA) produces for both TikTok and Instagram. Their reels tend to have a style, which are all acquired content from other sources, mostly other users and films. The clips usually begin with an opening clip of a user speaking directly to us, then a wave of music and moving images, ending with an image of text that often speeds by too quickly to read. The genre is either hopecore or corecore, depending on the video and your mood. This reel feels like corecore as it pierces through layers of the human condition on the rhythm of Radiohead’s Exit Music. What’s also worth further examination is how the same reel is received differently amongst users on different platforms. Effect becomes affect … depending on the audience affected. This work reveals that algorithmically-circulated montage doesn’t have a stable affect. It becomes a different object through the sorting algorithms, comment culture, and the base of users. Instagram users skew towards a phenomenological intensity, while TikTok users articulate melancholia for the same video. By making algorithmic mediation visible through cross-platform distribution, CoA transforms the montage into an analytical argument about how digital infrastructure shapes feeling. Database Gleaning by Andrea De Bedout De Bedout’s moving cinematic video essay is a blend of poetic and desktop documentary modes. We watch her mine The Gleaners and I (2000) dailies database revealing details of the filmmaking process. She shows us connections between the footage, archive, and interface, bringing in Lev Manovich as an interlocutor. Interface icons become moving images, buttons become prompts, themes become filenames. We see the act of gleaning of a gleaner. Like Hecht, De Bedout was invited to speak and screen her film at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. josh (with parentheses) is a video essayist who attempts to make complex, compelling arguments in the stupidest possible ways. He sometimes succeeds at the first part, but is pretty reliable for the second. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms by Kendra Gaylord I do not care even a tiny bit about architecture, the focus of Kendra Gaylord’s work, but I will never miss a single one of her videos. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms is a perfect example of why: architecture is, to her, something humans do that can help us understand humans. It is a story about the architectural history of a building, and also the emergence of a meme, and also about how a very generous man gave a lot to the internet and the least we can do is help him fix his roof. Why Milchick’s Story Hurts So Much: Black Survival in White Workplace by Afrodizjha Afrodizjha’s close appreciation of Tramell Tillman’s bravura performance as Mr. Milchick on Severance helped me understand Milchick as illustrative of the ways in which Blackness is controlled and repressed in white-dominated corporate spaces. Being a YouTuber Bankrupted Me by Innuendo Studios The first thing to say about this choice is that Ian Danskin’s work as Innuendo Studios is consistently phenomenal, from top to bottom and without exception. On Nebula, he is currently working on a series of short game reviews that construct a historical framework for the genre; I would find it shocking if others did not include this year’s The South Bank of the Rubicon among their poll responses; and his The Alt-Right Playbook series represents some of the most powerful and instructive analysis of the rhetorical manipulations that have enabled the rise of fascism over the last few decades. When Danskin published this video, he had nearly half a million subscribers and a well-earned reputation as one of the best and most thoughtful essayists on YouTube. He was, by most metrics of the platform, extremely successful. And yet, the title. I choose this essay for two reasons. First, I think Danskin’s experience highlights some of the major systemic problems facing working essayists on YouTube. There are plenty of essayists in similar positions, essayists who are doing remarkable work that is engaging their audience and drawing traffic to YouTube, and who are yet unable to sustain that work financially. Second, because Danskin’s GoFundMe hit *double* its goal within two days. Reading the comments both on the video and on the GFM shows how deeply and how well Danskin is loved and appreciated by his community, and how ready his audience was to step up and support him. It is easy to feel bleak, as a video essayist on YouTube in 2025, about the prospects of making a channel sustainable. This video showcases the difficult truth of that situation. The creators are showing up and doing phenomenal work. The audience is there ready and willing to support those creators. But the systems that creators need to enable their labor are not doing enough to keep them going. Defying Gravity | Synchronized Roller Coasters (Wicked) by Tube Cody I get made fun of a lot as having a somewhat chaotic definition of essay, but I’m sticking to my guns on this one: this roller coaster is a video essay. A lot of video essays come from a film background, and use the tools of filmmaking to develop their ideas. But those aren’t the only tools available to us! Sometimes we can make meaning through roller coaster design. And if you’re not convinced, listen to him talk about how and why he made the choices that he did. Video essayist on YouTube and Nebula who often uses video games as a springboard to speak about larger topics of art, philosophy, and politics. His first book, How a Game Lives, is available now from all major booksellers. This year, I’ve been thinking about the different generations of mainstream YouTube video essayists. While the first wave of YouTube essayists may have been inspired by film, television, and/or written essays, many popular 2025 creators are young enough that they grew up alongside the video essay. This younger cohort has been presented a goal that didn’t previously exist! While the first generation of essayists may have turned to YouTube in an attempt to ‘do something’ with their film and philosophy degrees, younger creators may indeed pursue certain fields of study with the goal of disseminating this knowledge as a video essayist. While the goal of becoming a YouTuber can result in a passion for algorithmic success over academic rigor, this new generation is also willing to push the boundaries of the familiar form, creating more ambitious and stylistically striking projects. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre The best video essay of the year, Alexandre’s work melds text and form in a dizzyingly ambitious trip through an unspeakably awful question: should trans people reduce their social visibility in an act of self-preservation? The essay itself, shot in extreme widescreen, builds a sense of paranoia – Alexandre herself only takes up a fraction of the scene and the urban landscape, cold and artificially lit, stretches out beyond her. It’s a testament to the video’s magnitude that Alexandre literally being tear gassed on the streets of Montreal is only its second most striking scene. The most striking is when she taps into the feed of a public surveillance camera, finding production quality in the constant, unwilling scrutiny she lives under. The 25 Best Films of 2024: A Video Countdown by David Ehrlich A countdown of the best films of 2024, sans traditional script or voiceover, seems outside the realm of typical video essay. And yet, Ehrlich’s 23-minute montage isn’t just a countdown but a conversation made through editing, a weaving together of hundreds of cinematic motifs from an entire year. The montage finds constant moments of delight in juxtaposition: the overture features scenes of Anora, Megalopolis, Dune, Challengers, and dozens more all choreographed together to a song from The Greatest Showman. I Saw the TV Glow functions as a meta-framing device throughout the montage – Justice Smith looks directly into the camera and intones “I watched these tapes over and over again, but they never got old.” The choice of musical accompaniment is, also, revelatory. In one standout sequence, Ehrlich introduces Nosferatu alongside Dion’s ‘My Heart Will Go On’, only to continue the song through his next pick, The Beast, finally climaxing alongside Dion with Challengers. The track is hilarious, yes, but also exactly captures the thematic core of each film. However, it’s the finale of the piece that cements it as Ehrlich’s best work so far. The crescendo seems to come early; after Anora (his #3 pick), the montage escalates into an ecstasy of scenes and sounds and emotion set to an epic rework of Madonna’s ‘Like a Prayer’. And when it seems the montage can rise no higher… it doesn’t. It crashes back down to Earth with the sparse harmonica of Springsteen’s The Promised Land and Ehrlich’s final two picks, No Other Land and Nickel Boys. An impossible level of craft throughout. Death of the Author: An Alan Wake Series Retrospective by Noah Caldwell-Gervais Much as series protagonist Alan Wake can’t help but spiral around his own universe of autofiction, Noah Caldwell-Gervais is helplessly drawn back to developer Remedy’s series of games. Having previously covered Alan Wake, Max Payne, and Control on his channel, Gervais now revisits each along a gargantuan journey to understand the layers of meaning woven throughout Alan Wake 2. Although the runtimes of many video essays have ballooned over the years, only Gervais is capable of keeping his writing on-target and engaging for nearly 200 minutes straight. And as Alan Wake 2 snakes through the themes of nearly every Remedy game, longtime fans of Gervais’ channel will see how this retrospective engages with many of his defining interests: Horror and noir, self-loathing writers, King’s Dark Tower series, goofy Rock and Roll stars. Gervais’ channel seemed incomplete without an essay on Alan Wake – and Alan Wake 2 itself seemed incomplete without an analysis by Gervais. Finally, both are settled. Art critic Backlot Connections by John Gibbs By juxtaposing filming locations and set designs, this video essay reveals the unseen ties between characters from different films and the unexpected thematic connections among them. It becomes a special cinematic space where these characters live, pass by one another, and perhaps even meet. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková By exploring the extinct star wipe film transition and its notorious history, the video essay transforms into a study in experimental media archaeology, revealing how this anachronistic artefact can still be relevant and useful today. Painful Cinephilia: Daney, Rivette, Video and Kapó by Alan O’Leary (OuScholPo) This video essay enters the ethical realm of Holocaust representation in cinema and creatively addresses the problem of unrepresentability: how to talk about a film that “no one has seen” and yet “no one has forgotten”? The Anthropocene Will Eat Itself by Cormac Donnelly We are living closer to the outbreak of a global/nuclear war than at any time since the Cold War. Yet, video essays reflecting on this are scarce. Cormac Donnelly, exploring the theme of the Anthropocene, conveys a similar sense of threat and destruction by applying the metaphor of cannibalism, media emulations, archives, and the form of an immersive trailer. Overturning Carmen’s feminicide: Materializing women’s agency through the musical by Barbara Zecchi This video essay reimagines the myth of Carmen from a feminist perspective. It stands out for its distinctive structure and form. Its tactile treatment of the material underscores its subversion of patriarchal traditions and narratives, while the ticking clock serves as a constant reminder that, in the real world, a woman is killed every ten minutes as a result of gender-based violence. gestures of thought: glance by Johannes Binotto Jean Epstein’s shimmering close-ups are boldly combined with the video essayist’s own personal archive and his wonderful music, lending the work additional sensitivity as it reflects on the elusive cinematic poetics of “shimmering images”. The Thinking Machine #95: Boro(que) Aesthetics by Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin Guided by Malcolm de Chazal’s Plastic-Sense aphorisms, this video essay allows us to see Walerian Borowczyk’s Immoral Women (1979) as one might contemplate a painter’s work. And it effectively conveys Chazal’s idea that “everything on earth is sensuously connected to everything else.” Filmmaker, researcher, and lecturer in Videographic Criticism at the University of Leeds Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant Sirens by Nan Goldin (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Ordinatrices: About the Negative Spaces of Early Computing by Occitane Lacurie Black & Arab Encounters on Screen by Abiba Coulibaly Freelance film scholar and video essayist. Newly elected Fellow of the British Academy As it gets harder and harder to select only seven videos for this poll, as in the last years, I have used three parameters in the composition of my list: I had to choose works by different essayists from those for whom I voted in 2024; and my selection could only feature personal favourites in the field of videographic criticism, that is, a specific film, television and screen studies subset of the ‘video essay’. The videos also needed to be already published and freely available online, which ruled out some great works for which I will undoubtedly be voting next year. Epilogue: Remembered Video by Alan O’Leary Alan’s characteristically brilliant, generous and superbly performed, filmed and edited audiovisual work (published in December 2024) was a commissioned response to The Personal Mediascape in the Age of Videographic Heterotopias, a cluster of ten videos and statements published in ASAP/J (the journal of the Association for the Study of the Arts of the Present) and curated by Joel Burges and Allison Cooper. The prompt for the cluster was Victor Burgin’s understanding of cinema as a kind of personal heterotopia (a fragmentary internal playlist or mediascape) constituted by the physical, virtual, and psychical ways in which we encounter it. As well as responding to this prompt and the videos which explored it in the main body of the issue, Epilogue: Remembered Video wonderfully articulates and exemplifies a method for videographic criticism and for humanistic criticism as such. Everyone interested in Videographic Criticism for scholarly purposes should watch it and the ten amazing videographic works with which it entered into conversation: Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place by Catalina Segú; Potbelly by Dayna McLeod; Fred Astaire’s Cane Hits My Brain by Will DiGravio; The Bijou Room by Desirée J. Garcia; The Uneasiness of Being a Subject: Queriendo sin querer by Jeffrey Romero Middents; Atmospheres of History in Larisa Shepitko’s Films by Viktoria Paranyuk; Epitaph for Sonja 1: Body/Archive/Movement by Amanda Doxtater; Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard; Desidentificación by Maillim Santiago; and Alterity Onscreen: A Gen-X Mediascape by Allison Cooper. Uncontaining Horror: 20th Century Spanish Women’s Meshes of Fear by Barbara Zecchi Published in December 2024 in the Spanish audiovisual essay journal Tecmerin. Revista de Ensayos Audiovisuales, Barbara’s video is one of the most original and powerful scholarly video essays I have watched, making an argument about women’s film authorship that really counts. Using two concepts from horror cinema as a theoretical framework – Eugenie Brinkema’s “genrelessness” and Jane Gaines’s “uncontainment” – Uncontaining Horror reinterprets films by 20th-century Spanish women directors that have not traditionally been classified as horror, offering a broader and certainly much less androcentric understanding of the genre. Not at Home by Deborah Martin Debbie’s video is a short but fabulously assembled split screen video essay that compares sequences from two films, The Innocents (Jack Clayton, 1951) and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Céline Sciamma, 2019), emphasising correspondences in the dynamics of space, gender, and movement in the films, and in their use of gothic conventions. It was published by [in]Transition: Journal of Videographic Film and Moving Image Studies, alongside brilliantly insightful reviews by Alison Peirse and Benjamin Sampson, in a double issue overflowing with remarkable works. I have singled it out as for me it is the perfect study of two of my all-time favourite films and is very much a video I will watch again and again, and would have loved to have made myself. I can’t wait for more of Debbie’s highly original videographic studies of space, uncanniness, queerness and horror to be published. (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson Lucy’s work is always brilliant and this video (deserved winner of the audiovisual essay competition at the Marienbad Film Festival in 2025) is both strikingly and uncannily so. Importantly, it succeeds in its aim of exploring the videographic form as a queer methodology. Departing from some of Lucy’s observations about space in Midsommar (Ari Aster, 2019), and using a variety of videographic editing techniques (multiscreen, image flipping, and mirroring, repetition, looping, reversing direction) as well as filming new material, her work takes up Sara Ahmed’s spatial understanding of queerness from her book, Queer Phenomenology, as she explains to great effect in her remarkable accompanying maker’s statement. Published in December 2024, ‘(dis)Orienting horror: feeling queerly’ is part of an extremely rich (first ever videographic) special issue on ‘Queer/ing Horror’, published by the Canadian horror journal Monstrum, guest edited by artist and video essayist extraordinaire Dayna McLeod, which also features amazing videographic work by Felicia Cosey (Jouissance at the Margins: Revisiting Bersani’s Is the Rectum a Grave? Through the Lens of Swallowed), Alex Hall (Lick the Blade: Locating a Queer Archive of Debris in Roberta Findlay’s The Oracle), Max Ranieri (We’re All Scrolling Through the World’s Fair: Online Horror Fiction as a Site of Queer Identity Formation), Heather O. Petrocelli and May Santiago (Queer + Horror), Ada Rosen (Inside(s) Out), Julia Erhart and Susan Bruce (Decentering Monstrosity in The Children’s Hour (1961)), Darren Elliott-Smith (Every creak, every groan, every tap in the wall, you’ll think of me: Spinning the Web of Trans*-Horror Metaphors in Cobweb (2023)), and Alison Peirse (I Can Hear Someone Coming). The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell For me, 2024–25 saw a surge in what might be regarded as ‘feature film length’ audiovisual essay projects, or certainly ones which, in their length, production ambitions and sometimes budgets, far exceeded the scope of most scholarly videographic work. Several examples of this trend are Christian Keathley’s hugely compelling 2024 work Cinephilia and History, or The Mystery of William Keighley, and Kevin B. Lee’s recently premiered urgent and fascinating desktop documentary Afterlives (Germany-Belgium-France 2025), Lúcia Nagib’s fabulously hybrid essay film/audiovisual essay Films to Die For (2025), as well as Steve Anderson’s recent film Reality Frictions. None of these are yet publicly viewable online, so remain beyond the scope of my selection. By far my favourite publicly available online work of extended scope is Jason Mittell’s amazing videographic serial project, a brilliant follow up to his recent reflexive study of Nathan Fielder’s TV show The Rehearsal. This time, he focuses on The Show About The Show, a webseries by filmmaker Caveh Zahedi that documents his life and the process of making the series. Jason’s project is at the cutting edge, both of video-essaying and academic research by practice, here, the practice of reflexive imitation of media works. It’s also extremely funny, highly ambitious, and very thought-provoking and original on the politics and ethics of contemporary nonfiction ‘film’making. Jason’s essential and informative introduction to the work is online here. A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková, and Jiří Žák It’s been another great year for the dynamic videographic duo Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková, who also published the remarkable and hilarious work The Return of the Star Wipe at [in]Transition in June 2025. I also love their important and formally innovative collaboration with Jiří Žák on Czech cinema made for the Audiovisual Approaches and the Archive Dossier published by MOVIE: A Journal of Film Criticism. Focusing on three films, 26 frames, and a single GIF, A Tale of Two Desktops proposes a new vision of archival film, one that builds on and departs from Jiří Anger’s award-winning 2024 book Towards a Film Theory from Below: Archival Film and the Aesthetics of the Crack-Up. Like the earlier video essays I have selected for this year’s poll, this work is a model of creative scholarship, in other words, it is the result of a disciplined process, using artistic as well as intellectual methods, for creating credible knowledge that can receive and withstand critical scrutiny, and which is able to be built upon by others as it itself has built on earlier studies. The Thinking Machine #93: Longing by Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin Last but far from least, I have selected Longing, one of the many dozens of amazing works by the longstanding masters of film criticism in audiovisual essay form, Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin, in their ongoing collaboration for the online Dutch film magazine Filmkrant. It was hard to single out just one work by them from 2025, but I really loved this one about the striking similarities between two films starring Tilda Swinton, 35 years apart: Friendship’s Death (Peter Wollen, 1987) and Three Thousand Years of Longing (George Miller, 2022). Like those two films, Longing is a beautiful, powerful and insightful work. Assistant Professor at IULM University and co-editor of [in]Transition Every year it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with the many fascinating works that are published online, presented at public events such as festivals and showcases, and so on. Choosing personal favourites is even harder. This list includes some of the works that have most prompted me to reflect, inspired me, and opened up new research possibilities for me. Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant As someone interested in women’s labour in film production, I was truly struck by the inventive and surprising ways Grant and Bell find to explore and visually convey the work of script supervisor Penny Eyles. The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell In this series, Jason Mittell experiments by adopting certain formal traits of the object he analyses – seriality and self-reflexivity – in clever and original ways, thus devising a complex and innovative methodological approach Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee Afterlives is a feature film and, given its production value, perhaps shouldn’t be on this list. Still, it represents the most accomplished outcome of an aesthetic and methodology Lee has developed in his practice as a video essayist. It is both a theoretical reflection on the image and a moving, profound meditation on the limits of the visible. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková The research Jiří and Veronika are conducting on the archaeology of video technology and the early years of digital media is truly compelling. By focusing on marginal and eccentric forms within the history of audiovisual technology, they reveal the intricate ties between aesthetics, technology, and the economics of the moving image. Backlot Connections by John Gibbs Some years ago, the work of Mark Rappaport and his book The Secret Life of Moving Shadows sparked in me a fascination not only for studio backlots and props histories, but also for the video essay as a tool capable of making invisible connections visible and accessible. This is precisely what John Gibbs achieves, with precision and elegance, in Backlot Connections. Locarno parla italiano – 404!: Glitching Locarno Film Festival by Silvia Cipelletti and Evelyn Kreutzer The video essay speaks Italian! I watched Silvia and Evelyn develop this project brilliantly during a workshop in Locarno, and the way they turned obstacles into creative opportunities is incredibly clever. AV essayist and media scholar, and researcher of gimmicky artefacts Potential of sketches, playfulness of research questions, unexpected conclusions from close readings, ephemeral phenomena, as well as work that enters the territory of violent imagery. Research in videographic scholarship and the essay film form does not operate within fixed or predetermined boundaries. My picks reflect this, in no particular order. Vampire Optics by Allan Cameron From Kittler’s reading of vampires in relation to recording and copying technologies such as the typewriter and the phonograph, to Shane Denson’s analysis of Frankenstein and the advent of sound in moving pictures, or Jiří Anger’s reading of early films in which a spliced and re-glued frame in an analogue strip produces a Frankensteinian moment at the levels of both materiality and perception, I have developed a deep appreciation for understanding monsters (their bodies, powers, and vulnerabilities) as inseparable from the media that shape them. Cameron’s audiovisual essay traces vampires along a similar path, yet refuses to stop at the boundaries of medium specificity. Instead, it follows the screen vampire’s unique relationship with light, thus revealing an interconnected network of ‘vampire optics’: mirrors, shadows, shimmer, focus, flicker, and more. The video essay is connected to Cameron’s Visceral Screens: Mediation and Matter in Horror Cinema; you can watch the essay first and then read the book, or reverse the order. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee The Medusa of Hatra becomes a single image that opens up an entire network of interconnected questions about who has the right to know, to protect, and to use cultural heritage. It sits at the crossroads of ISIS propaganda, violent imagery, the politics of digital archives, and the ethics of remembering. It forces us to ask: Who is being remembered, by whom, and by what means? Who shapes the narrative, and who is shaped by it? Underlying these questions is a deeper one: where does agency reside, and where does it dissolve into forms of being interpreted, mediated, or spoken for by others? For Kevin, vulnerability does not arise merely from viewing a brutal or violent image. It comes from navigating the tensions and voices that gather around these questions, existing within an ever-evolving discourse of power… The film stands as the culmination of years of filmmaking and research, and it is a film well worth seeing. Also read Seeing without Seeing – Towards a Generative Archival Practice. Toute la data du monde by Evelyn Kreutzer A connection emerges with the voice-over from Alain Resnais’s Toute la mémoire du monde, which reflects on the library as a system of memory. Evelyn extends this parallel by proposing a way of approaching AI as a system that not only structures memory but actively produces it. This idea resonates with Kevin’s Afterlives, especially in the section where AI appears as the only remaining archive of certain (here, extremist) images. The audiovisual essay therefore positions AI not merely as a tool of image production but as a system of knowledge, power, and memory that demands investigation. It suggests that we should not be intimidated by these black-box, seemingly shiny tools, but instead look closely at what lies within them. Good to pair with Silvia Cipelletti’s piece Memoria Algoritmica. For a broader context, one might go to see Alan Warburton’s Wizard of AI. Imaging Orphée / Orphée imaginé by Jenny Oyallon-Koloski What if Jacques Demy had made Parking differently? Imaging Orphée plays with this alternative past, through editing, remixing, and counterfactual speculation, it explores how his 1985 queer musical might have taken another form. In dialogue with Demy’s style and contemporary media, a new Orpheus emerges, singing across time and cultures. Drawing on an eclectic corpus and on what we know of Demy’s craft, Imaging Orphée uses videographic means to envision how the past itself might have unfolded otherwise, a mode of analysis that becomes an act of playful reinvention. If the piece invites us to re-imagine other films, then it is an invitation worth accepting. A Life of Its Own: American Psycho by Sara Bezovšek A reconfiguration of a film and its afterlife (through memes, videos, ads, and other artefacts) into the single frame of a web browser, forming one associative stream, a never-ending analysis. I would love to see more similar analytical work that unfolds within the scope of a single virtual window or a single frame, much like how TikTok or an Instagram Reel can operate, as Hysterical Melancholy / Cyber Trash does for digital nostalgia. Comedy Objects #1: Slapstick Speculation by Noah Teichner When you are watching film comedies, what do you focus on? The predicaments of the main character, the misbehaviour of everything around them, the jokes? Noah focuses on Hollywood film comedies from the 1930s. To do so, he is able to connect the humour and the language (the delivery of the jokes) to the omnipresence of the financial crisis. A close reading of figures of speech, gesture, and music places film comedies less in the realm of frivolous slips of the tongue and more within the logic of the system, financial system. In researching the history and phenomenon of slapstick comedies, this essay pairs nicely with Petr Král’s Le Burlesque ou Morale de la tarte à la crème, even though they approach the subject from slightly different perspectives. Published as part of a special issue of the journal Images secondes on Cinema and Financial Speculation (edited by Occitane Lacurie and Barnabé Sauvage). Television Still Delivers People: Re-Creating the 1973 Video Manifesto by Richard Serra and Carlotta Fay Schoolman through Multiple Screens and Various Media by Jaap Kooijman About our relationship to the screen, about our subjectivity and agency, and about the very idea of a mass medium; about the fact that there is not just one television screen but many, and whether ‘mass’ even remains a meaningful category. A playful media-archaeological sketch, not yet published. Presented as a work-in-progress at NECS 2025. Video essayist Part Time Video Essayist Full Time Video Essay Enjoyer You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) With the rise of AI in the past few years, I have seen many coworkers, friends and family members all sort of ‘give up’ when it comes to the small amount of writing they are challenged with. This video really tackles this trend and comes from a unique position of a teacher who still believes in his students. Also there’s a part which mentions Baby Gronk that made me cry, which is definitely the only time that will happen (I hope). You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel “And you may ask yourself, ‘Well, how did I get here?’” These words really struck me in David Byrne’s True Stories, Big Joel’s You are into Mousetrap Youtube struck me in a very similar way. The internet is a wide and weird place and we all find ourselves in unique and specific rabbit holes. You are likely not into Mousetrap Youtube but there’s something in its place that fascinates you. You Seem Like You Wouldn’t Clap for Tinkerbell by Afterthoughts A very raw essay about someone’s own struggle wrestling with their belief that I would imagine everyone with a loved one they’ve lost can relate to. Impressively it was all written, filmed and edited for a 48 hour collab. What’s Stopping You? (Spoiler: It’s You) by Nathan Zed Brilliant editing, tight writing, and a warm reminder to nourish that same child-like passion you had for something in the first place. Another classic. A Video Essay About Efficiency by Pillar of Garbage A clever video essay metaphor used to tackle what is lost in shortcuts made in our everyday lives. The Musical Easter Egg in Close Encounters of the Third Kind by Kikikrazed This unlocked a connection I completely missed on my first watch of Close Encounters, it helped me further understand what Spielberg and company were going for in this film and I’m a little excited to give it a rewatch from that lens. Camp Rock Is About Food Poisoning by Indietrix A thorough analysis of Camp Rock’s haphazard portrayal of food safety done with tons of comedy and an appreciation for the profession. Media scholar and video essayist; University of Minnesota a rumble from the core of the earth by Laura Del Vecchio and Katarzyna Paszkiewicz I am beyond impressed how this video essay achieves the core mission of videographic scholarship – making a compelling, theoretically sophisticated, and novel argument both in the written statement as well as the audiovisual material. Challenging the notions of Western-centric knowledge production and perception is easier said than done; yet, the exquisite editing offers the viewer not only the space to critically reflect on but to experience what it means to “listen otherwise”. The Anthropocene Will Eat Itself by Cormac Donnelly Like in some of his other works, Donnelly’s layering of tactility – from the visual framing and the materiality of the visual and audio clips to the body horror of the depicted cannibalism – manages to create a horrifying visceral aftereffect that is simultaneously highly entertaining and deeply disturbing. Cheezit Timeline by Benedetta Andreasi I love how Andreasi’s response to technical issues creates a meditation on the intimacy and precarity of sharing one’s own creative process in the form of the editing timeline. Instead of minimising proximity, the physical embodiment of both the creator and their surroundings introduces an unexpected distance to the work – the anxiety I feel over the filled cup at the centre reflecting the refusal to let me get too close. Classif & Me (Laird’s Constraint) by Alan O’Leary A perfect example of the productive energy of constraints that invite and ultimately necessitate subversion. I have a deep appreciation for how O’Leary makes room for what he calls errors in his work that prove themselves as rich points of engagement. The video is playful yet contemplative and intellectually thought-provoking. Short film programmer, artistic leader at Go Short My picks are drawn primarily from the film festival circuit. In no particular order: Zodiac Killer Project by Charlie Shackleton Deconstructing true crime tropes with much humour, and somehow still making it a thrilling true crime watch. The Flowers Stand Silently, Witnessing by Theo Panagopoulos Very powerful archive essay; by recontextualising images creating a space to reflect on the oppression of Palestinian people. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory Maryam Tafakory delivering her annual banger; this time with some breathtaking colours. happiness by Fırat Yücel How to carry the weight of the world’s pain when it’s constantly live-broadcast to our screens; no one can sleep until everyone is free. A Reconnaissance by Stefan Kruse With each film Stefan Kruse is diving deeper into the world of surveillance. This time he’s so invested he even steps away from his computer, finding himself at a Maltese airport standing alongside plane spotters to capture images of a covert drone. Abortion Party by Julia Mellen More like a video column maybe? Film curator and lecturer at Geneva University of Art and Design (HEAD), where she gives a course on the power of representation in contemporary cinema with a focus on gender, decolonial and ecological studies. These works expand the territory of the essay film, one in which individual subjectivities operate as critical lenses onto broader socio-political structures. Mobilising strategies drawn from archival material, autofiction, forensic aesthetics, and postcolonial critique, the films interrogate the conditions under which memory, identity, and power are created. The works foreground the essay film as a site of epistemological resistance: a cinematic practice that both questions dominant narratives and experiments with the forms through which knowledge itself can be constructed, destabilised, and reclaimed. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory This film is a lyrical, politically charged meditation in which a young woman’s first love story with a woman blooms amid the shadows of state violence, weaving intimate confession with the unspoken traumas of Iran’s night-gardens. The film beautifully and powerfully weaves flowers, manuscript illuminations and film excerpts that create a film of love and desire that transcends the power structures. Cold Call by Stefanie Schroeder In a personal essay on the very act of writing, the filmmaker meets digital scam culture, transforming an intrusive phone call into an unexpected portrait of vulnerability, creative paralysis, and accidental resistance. Stefanie Schroeder’s film questions the intimate through cyber vigilantism, racism and power relationships. The rhythm of her film is particularly interesting as her personal story develops in parallel to the person on the other side of the line. Sixty-Seven Milliseconds by Fleuryfontaine This forensic, hybrid investigation traces the path of a single bullet through motion capture and CGI, exposing the distortions of policing and the politics embedded in every frame of surveillance. Fleuryfontaine’s (Antoine Fontaine and Galdric Fleury) film resonates a lot with recent violent events that happened in Switzerland. Nsala by Mickael-Sltan Mbanza The film is a haunting use of colonial archives that merges silence, fiction, and contemporary imagery to reclaim erased histories and rehumanise those frozen in exploitative imagery. Mickael-Sltan Mbanza plays with colonial archives and contemporary footage to fictionally recount the story of a couple recruited to work in a mine under colonial rule. I Can’t Think of Anything Right Now by Hussen Ibraheem A rain-soaked, metaphysical road film where a simple ride slips into a dreamlike detour through memory, exile, and the fragile boundaries between forgetting and survival. In Hussen Ibraheem’s film, water carries the past and the future of those who are trapped in between memories and exile. Abortion Party by Julia Mellen Abortion Party is a chaotic, irreverent autobiographical film that turns a fraught reproductive decision into an absurd, messy celebration of chosen family, bad timing, and the dark comedy of youth. Julia Mellen’s film is witty and opens up to new ways of celebrating dark times. Lost Songs of Sundari by Sudarshan Sawant The film proposes a gentle, elegiac triptych of voices reflecting on Mumbai’s shifting shorelines, capturing the quiet vanishing of coastal worlds reshaped, almost erased, by relentless urban expansion. Sudarshan Sawant creates an essay where the living and the non-living find a common space in an ever reshaping landscape. Video essayist and music producer under the name Kai After Kai. Also producer, co-writer, and composer for the horror fiction podcast Kingscreek The Most Boring Place in Tears of the Kingdom? by Any Austin Video games, perhaps by nature, tend to be pretty goal/purpose oriented. One of the first things you might ask about that game is “what do you DO in it?” But recently I’ve found myself developing a sort of fondness for moments in games that give me the opportunity to simply do ‘nothing’ – games that have things with no ‘purpose’ or ‘meaning’, but simply ‘are’. This video by Any Austin echoes that growing fascination – a video that explores areas in the Zelda game Tears of the Kingdom that objectively have no practical gameplay purpose, but nonetheless have their own value in spite of that due to simply being there. From helping enhance an adventure game’s roleplaying elements to helping to curate a sense of player expectation and anticipation, it’s clear that moments like these have merit in gaming, and I’m glad to see it explained so well. The Opposite of Cosmic Horror by Tale Foundry It’s a real mark of quality and impact when a work changes the way I think about and process the world, even if in the most minute way. As a massive fan and now creator of cosmic horror, I’m used to dreaming up concepts and monsters far larger than any one person could ever imagine or even process, but this video exposed to me how that feeling can, ironically, still lead to a form of anthropocentrism. Rarely do we give much thought to those smaller than us — much smaller — who might look up at us and feel their sense of scale and understanding of the universe fall out from under them. The pests that scurry between our walls, the vermin that hide in our corners, the objects of so much fear and hate from ourselves, but have we ever really considered how they feel? Have *I* ever considered how they feel when I cast my shadow over them and, without a second thought, end their existence and continue like they were simply nothing? I can say that I do. Now. When Death Note Broke Its Own Rules by Sloan Stowe Part of why I make videos could be said to be ‘obsession’. That is to say, my videos are born from feelings when something, no matter how big or small, crawls over my brain, leaving its impact all over as it grasps my mind and refuses to let go. In that sense, I think I may have found a kindred spirit. Sloan spends half an hour examining a scene less than a fifth of that length, but not a single second is wasted. Every one is filled with some kind of analysis of cinematography, localisation, animation, acting, sound design, all in service of unpacking everything buried underneath these four minutes of anime characters talking in the rain. It is the kind of video born when something truly takes root in you and demands to be acknowledged, demands to be explored. It’s something I truly love to see, in myself yes, but especially in others. Video essayist (as LambHoot) and solutions architect So many video essayists leaned into irreverence this year. If you’re like me, a wave of borderline comedy essays flew through your sub feed. Many messed with tone, interlacing absurd subject matter and harsh delivery into the usual structure. In nonchalant voices, authors spread messages, opined inconclusively on difficult topics, and counted how many functional urinals there were in video games. Many of my picks showed rather than told. The medium felt so much more self-aware. I had a blast watching all of these. I Studied for My Citizenship Test with Assassin’s Creed 3 by SolidArf I’ve watched enough YouTube to know to always click any Assassin’s Creed 3 video essays that bless your timeline. SolidArf’s timely piece examines how many of the US citizenship test’s questions are answered accurately by the game’s content, and ultimately evolves into a critique of both. How Many Times Can You Pee in Heavy Rain? by Allie Meowy Genuinely the most ‘laugh out loud’ video essay this year (maybe ever). An absolutely absurd premise leads to an examination of granularity and detail in virtual worlds. Like if AVGN made video essays (I swear this is a compliment). Bluey Is Perfect, and That Terrifies Me by MML’s Commentaries Matt examines his biases as a child of separated parents, confronting his anxieties about potential parenthood. I wasn’t familiar with Bluey before this, but the video helped me understand why so many parent friends praise the show. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre The most ‘show, don’t tell’ video essay of the year, so much so that it literally takes your peripheral vision to watch. No other video essayist put themselves on the front line as much as Lily did this year (again, literally). A raw examination of visibility, vulnerability, and safety. Recommended post-watch read: Unlearning Shame (Devon Price, 2024). A Narrative Analysis of Space Invaders by Chariot Rider Some of my favourite videos are Chariot Rider’s. I can’t discuss this one’s subject matter without spoiling a twist that made me laugh out loud… but I can say that Chariot is the master of extracting a mile from an inch. My Quest to Uncover the Mystery of Death Stranding 2’s Porters by Writing on Games My favourite Writing on Games videos are those where he points a camera at something benign long enough for a meaningful narrative to emerge from it. By following random NPCs long after they would naturally de-spawn, Hamish highlights aspects of the world’s design he’d otherwise miss. Like watching a leaf under a microscope and remembering how alive it really is. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms by Kendra Gaylord Another terrific video I can’t possibly spoil. I didn’t know the Backrooms were real photographs until watching this, but I’m gladly less unsettled by them now. Kendra digs through blueprints and renovation documents to trace a cause-and-effect chain from a 1910s department store to the modern-day meme. Associate Professor in Audiovisual Arts and Cognition at the University of Groningen, NL / co-author of Film Studies in Motion: From Audiovisual Essay to Academic Research Video Trying to get a grip on a year’s videographic production is becoming increasingly difficult as the output grows exponentially over time. This unavoidably results in a highly personal selection (and potentially less overlap among the videos chosen by others), which is good news because it also indicates a quickly increasing videographic scene and community. Where Do You Put the Camera? by Every Frame a Painting (Taylor Ramos and Tony Zhou) Every Frame a Painting has only released a single video in 2025, which is bad news for all cinephiles who appreciate Tony Zhou’s meticulous research, clarity in argumentation, and seamless delivery, but good news for all other video essayists who will now have a chance to make it to our best-of-the-year lists. Crochet Is Sick! by Alison Peirse Delicately balancing between the subjective-personal (“when I watch horror films, I wrap myself in crochet blankets”) and the objective-scholarly (“crochet is … a portent, a warning of impending horror”), this simple but superbly edited and soundtracked supercut video makes mediated crochet almost tangible. Cineradiographic Vision by Onur Turgut The term cineradiography, which gives the project its title, underscores the capacity of imaging technologies to reveal the anatomy of cinematic space, both metaphorically, by unraveling spatial meaning, and perceptually, by disrupting visual norms. A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková, Jiří Žák Do you, as a teacher of early cinema, struggle to make the audiovisual past relevant to the current generation of your students? By examining “how nitrate film materials from the beginnings of cinema – with all their weird shapes, textures, and visual quirks – survive and circulate in the digital age,” this well-researched and excellently produced hands-on film archaeological experiment offers a brilliant solution. Google Mapping Blow-Up: A Desktop Remediation by Cáit Murphy This video, which combines one of my favourite films (Blowup), activities (film-induced tourism), and videographic methods (desktop documentary), checks off many of my cinephile boxes. The ParAIax View by Ariel Avissar A shot-to-shot AI remake of the montage sequence from Alan J. Pakula’s 1974 The Parallax View is my favourite conceptual video essay of the year. Audiovisual essayists, writers, cinephiles 100 Years of History in 100 Films by kaptainkristian Reaching the year 2001 / Reaching the film 2001. From there, the timeline collapsed. Another timeline was added. And what ‘it’ showed was parallel to what we saw, or perhaps its inner face/essence. Is the inner face of 2019 Blade Runner (1982)? Is Steve Jobs 2015 or 1998… and The Matrix, which is its very, very own year itself. Reaching 2002 and 2005, following the passage through the inter-dimensional gates of Kubrick’s 2001, and Patlabor 2 followed – the iron mecha hands; the iron hands of Zuckerberg/Eisenberg that wrote our destiny – where you understand-don’t-understand where we are anymore. The transcendence of a seemingly simple idea, a seemingly simple[minded] understanding. The nervousness of the discrepancy between that year in history and the film’s production year. How masculine and phallic the century we have passed through is (if not the entire last millennium!); even Freddie Mercury in concert is along the same lines. 1979 must be Iran, right: The Masculine-Barbaline revolution. In your mind, you have the films’ production years in parallel, and aside from the simple fact that the story of many films takes place in a year different from their production year, this tells us something about ‘time’; is Blade Runner just arriving in 2019? We’ve gone way past that! Reaching the ticking seconds of the doomsday clock: The outer/inner face of these final years. All the films are beautiful here. Even all the ones you hate are redeemed here. The Matrix, Blade Runner, 2001: The electricity of these three dispersed panels. And opening with Ordet, with creator’s own signature on the image. The senses of The Silence of the Lambs by Lara Callaghan, Adam Woodward (Little White Lies) Sometimes you need a little silence to be touched. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Films are carried by the hands of their lovers [through history]; by their shadows. Associate Professor of Media Studies, University of Amsterdam Fading Echoes: Remembering and Forgetting through Videotapes by Vladimir Rosas-Salazar This audiovisual essay shows that videographic criticism can be an effective form to address media archaeology. Composed of home-made footage, Fading Echoes demonstrates how video can serve as a tool for remembering while simultaneously revealing how memories fade through the medium’s own material degradation. By foregrounding glitches, deterioration, and other traces of wear, the piece connects these visual ruptures to José van Dijck’s concept of mediated memories, emphasising not only how media shape remembrance but also how they contribute to forgetting. The result is a moving, personal, and poetic visualization of the intertwined processes through which memories are both captured and lost. Not at Home by Deborah Alexandra Martin The dual split screen, placing a sequence from one film alongside a sequence from another, is a well-established technique in videographic criticism. Consider, for example, Kogonada’s What is Neorealism? or Liz Greene’s Velvet Elephant. Not at Home fits seamlessly into this tradition, inviting a compare-and-contrast between the films The Innocents (Clayton, 1951) and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Sciamma, 2019). By juxtaposing these (seemingly unedited) sequences with a focus on the candle as a prop, the audiovisual essay raises relevant questions about femininity and space, bringing the films into a rich dialogue that goes beyond just compare-and-contrast. Not at Home demonstrates how effective this relatively simple split-screen technique is. The History of Music Video in 169 Seconds by Mathias Bonde Korsgaard The History of Music Video in 169 Seconds is a supercut of 61 ‘canonical’ music videos, one from every year between 1964 and 2024, together presenting a history of music video in an eclectic and rapidly edited style reminiscent of the so-called MTV aesthetic – with a sidenote that the supercut is in chronological order. That these music videos are indeed canonical becomes clear, at least to me, as it takes only a snippet (both visually and audibly) to recognise them. Although the supercut itself is quite short (in fact 135 seconds rather than the stated 169 seconds), it is accompanied by a relatively extensive written text that not only clarifies the criteria for selecting the featured videos but also reflects on the scholarly need to establish a canon. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková One can easily be deceived by the playful presentation of The Return of the Star Wipe, as the voice-over and the editing adopt a tongue-in-cheek tone that mirrors the kitschy nature of the star-wipe transition itself. Yet this funny and even nostalgic presentation proves highly effective in delivering a well-researched and convincing argument in media archeology. The audiovisual essay demonstrates the added value of videographic criticism, as no written article could so effectively and vividly discuss the mechanics and cultural relevance of this admittedly tacky technique. The Return of the Star Wipe is not only a delight to watch but an illuminating and informative exploration of an often-overlooked element in media history. Postdoctoral researcher, video essayist, curator, Università della Svizzera italiana I want to make one important disclaimer: In past years, to avoid any conflict of interest, I usually abstained from nominating any pieces in which I was directly involved (as editor or consultant, for example) or by video essayists with whom I have a particularly close and current working relationship. This year, two of my nominations (by Lee and by Cipelletti) are exceptions to this rule but I believe they are warranted because they present important milestones in the larger video essay landscape with regards to videographic output’s migration into other fields of media production and consumption. Cinephilia and History, or The Mystery of William Keighley by Christian Keathley Chris Keathley’s long-form video essay/film presents three seemingly totally disparate starting points (a personal, autobiographical reflection; a local history; and a film- and industry-historical investigation) and then beautifully and affectively integrates them with each other. The film is touching, whimsical, highly informative and tonally precise, and a real template for videographic engagements with audiovisual history, memory, and lived experience. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková One of the most entertaining and original video essays of the recent past. I applaud the makers for their originality — in terms of topic (who else would think to make a video essay about a particular, largely forgotten editing transition?) and in terms of their own videographic style that is both very true to the history they lay out, and yet very recognizable in its authorial signature. It’s a great example of how the video essay can emulate, play with, and indulge in the tonal registers of its object of analysis. The Water Diaries, or My Letter to Jane by Chiara Grizzaffi A beautiful, poetic, and pensive meditation on water and film as they both move us and connect us to the world and our imaginations. Beginning with the maker’s reflections on what it means for her to be present in a specific film-institutional site (Locarno Film Festival) and connecting it (via water images and metaphors) to the oeuvre of a specific film auteur (Jane Campion), the video moves from the personal to the analytical and from the local to the global in a seamless, rhythmic flow. Why Do I Love These VICIOUS Queens? by Matt Baume Matt Baume’s videos are generally thoroughly researched, highly entertaining, and great documentaries of the (often hidden, often tumultuous) queer stories in Hollywood and mainstream media history. I like this one in particular because it picks up a personal question of taste (in the title) to go into a much larger investigation into TV history, the history of queer representation, and transatlantic media comparisons. the decline in literacy & rise in ai by silver fox A very DIY and formally simple investigation into a huge and pressing societal concern: literacy and media consumption among young people in the age of AI. Made by a gen-Z youtuber about a primarily gen-alpha phenomenon and building on the maker’s commentary and numerous social media videos and testimonials, it is an acute call for awareness that I take seriously and appreciate. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee As I mentioned in my disclaimer, I closely work with Kevin B. Lee and have witnessed him work on this project tirelessly for several years, so I am admittedly biased. I want to stress, however, that this is a major step in video essay history – after many years of developing the desktop documentary format in the larger realm of video essay culture, Lee has now produced a feature-length documentary film that develops this methodology into a large-scale archival, media-reflexive, and politically acute investigation that is screening at major film festivals at the moment. Memoria Algoritmica by Silvia Cipelletti Here’s my second highly biased nomination – for a video essay by my colleague Silvia Cipelletti, which presents another major milestone in video essay development. Produced first for a public screening event at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, an alternative, new version of the video essay was then commissioned by Arte.tv (one of the most important and prestigious European TV channels and producers of cultural innovation). I like both versions a lot (the original video essay and the TV version) and believe they serve as great case studies to compare how the same argumentation might be adapted to different media ecologies. I applaud both Cipelletti and Arte for this transition of videographic content as it migrates from digital platforms to museum spaces to television. Video-essayist, film critic and researcher Once again, I am taking part in this list by sharing a few works which interested me – and once again, chance (and curators) played a huge role in the way I got to see them. Also, my list is less a top than an homage to videos and videasts I love. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory I saw this film at FIDMarseille, in July 2025, a few months after Maryam Tafakory was given a ‘carte blanche’ retrospective dedicated to her work at Cinéma du Réel. The artist continues her patient mosaic work of reassembling Iranian cinema. The images are superimposed, altered and recoloured using a method that creates what can only be described as a style. Daria’s Night Flowers radicalises a return to onscreen text present in her previous works. The artist composes an herbarium of flowers immortalised by cinema, admired, displayed or picked by the female characters that her films habitually observe. On the editing table, these images encounter the illuminated flowers of the Kitab-e hashayish (کتاب حشايش), a pharmacological codex from 1595 with multicoloured illustrations. Abortion Party by Julia Mellen I saw this work, which pretends to be a videographic application to an artist grant at FIDMarseille too. Julia Mellen explains that she was inspired by a specific aesthetic associated with boomers’ social media habits – or rather, their Facebook habits – and their taste for dubious 3D modelling. At the edge of the frame, the director launches into a 13-minute uninterrupted story time – the length of the film – facing the camera, during which she recounts the organisation of a party to celebrate her abortion. This format of self-narrative, which originated with the video hosting platform YouTube before migrating and enjoying even greater success on TikTok, is more indicative of generations whose adolescence and young adulthood have been intertwined with digital technology. However, the setting for this performance, filmed in a single sequence shot, constantly bounces from one segment to another within a larger frame, reproducing the artist’s memories in 3D. It is difficult not to recognise, in this mechanical ballet, a screensaver from yesteryear, whose media archaeology takes us back to the DVD players of old. Thus, Julia Mellen’s stream of consciousness, which echoes the flow of her words, seems to be shaped by different layers of the artist’s technological and personal history. The personal is media, one thinks when seeing Abortion Party – since it demonstrates from the outset, through its very subject matter, how political the personal can be. Man Number 4 by Miranda Pennell I am really interested in Miranda Pennell’s filmic and videographic essays and I had the chance to see her latest piece at the Go Short Film Festival in Nijmegen. This work takes place in a single picture from which the film slowly zooms out, from a mosaic of pixels to faces, to surroundings, to context, to realisation. The process somehow reminded me of other videographic works: Capricorn Sunset by Johannes Binotto, or what remains by belit sağ, in which the constitutive particle of the image becomes the measuring unit of an invisible violence, contained within the representation. The picture was taken in December 2023 in Gaza, and shows mass deportation by the IDF of Palestinians, blindfolded, handcuffed, half-naked, almost as numerous as the pixels that concealed them. Very composed, the photograph evokes Goya’s painting, the digital encoding of visual information replacing the brushstroke, carrying the same ineffable violence. The Flowers Stand Silently, Witnessing by Theo Panagopoulos I also saw this archival essay at Go Short. This piece is also part of a growing corpus of videographic works which try to resist the visual annihilation of Palestinian history. For this film, Panagopoulos collects a 16mm botanical diary, shot by an English scientist who was commissioned to document the flora of Mandatory Palestine in the late 1930s. Accidentally – a bit like in Kamal Al Jafari’s films – Palestinians appear among the colourful fields of flowers, working, passing by, living at the edges of the frame. At the centre of the image, often, a smiling Englishman, uprooting plants with a joyful violence, which seems to contain in germ more than a century of forthcoming history. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková They already know it: I am a huge fan of Veronika and Jiří’s work, their playful and unique approach to video essay and videographic history. They represent an essential current in our community: the archaeology of videographic creation itself. This is truly a necessary and courageous work to engage with the very history of what we take for granted (or what the design thinking made us see as natural) either software-wise or hardware-wise. To engage with these crucial questions, they always find an original path, an unexpected motif, a fascinating idea: in this case, the favourite transition of every kid that once got to play with Windows Movie Maker. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee Once again, the proof is masterfully made that video essay can exist as a feature film. I do not want to say too much about this documentary which is continuing its journey in festivals – I myself have not yet had the chance to see it on a big screen. Both through its theme, its material and its method, Afterlives manages to uncover the forensic potential of video essay and to show how this form is able to reflect upon the constant reconfiguration of the contemporary visual culture, especially in the age of AI. L’Histoire politique du festival de Locarno by Cinéma et politique I had the chance to watch Clémentine Meyer’s video essay about the Locarno Film Festival… in Locarno. Working with archival material and scale models representing the actors in this extraordinary story, the videast retraces the political, economic and cinephilic layers that form the foundation of this festival, unique in Europe. From ostpolitik to erotica, this video uncovers the strong (and unexpected) tendencies that shaped the moving identity of Locarno. Assistant Professor of Japanese Film at the University of British Columbia and video essayist This year, I was drawn to works that foreground process, of making-as-thinking, of media as something that is made. The works that inspired me invite viewers, in a variety of ways, to consider how ideas take shape. They encourage us to think about the drafts behind the draft, the gestures of selection and omission, and the rhythmic negotiations between intention and accident. Each of these works feature how video essayists can think through the act of mixing and ‘meddling’, as media scholar Ritika Kaushik puts it, and they invite us to witness and feel the stages of research and experimentation that shape them. phenomenology of marco damilano by Benedetta Andreasi Developed during the Reframing the Argument videographic workshop held at Notre Dame University (summer, 2025), the piece turns its own process into an analytic method: a deliberately off-kilter voiceover unsettles the polished aesthetic of Damilano’s Il Cavallo e la Torre, exposing how broadcast news creates a comfortable distance between viewer and ‘displaced other’. The final minute of shared silence, stripped of commentary, lands with an imperative quiet force. It is a videographic gesture that reframes spectatorship itself, inviting us to sit with what mediated discourse so often smooths over. For an even more open embrace of process, and rising to the challenge of facing disruptive difficulties, I also love Benedetta’s Cheezit Timeline, hosted on the new-this-year platform Fragments: A Journal of videographic form and method developed by Cormac Donnelly, Jemma Saunders, and Will DiGravio. Age Perfect by Dayna McLeod Age Perfect emerges directly from a community of practice that treats process as the argument itself. It is bold and brave and smart and everything I love about McLeod’s work. By entering the glossy world of anti-aging ads through performance and tactile re-creation, McLeod exposes the artifice behind beauty culture(s) and treats process not as something to be hidden but as the very site of discovery. In the spirit of Johannes Binotto’s Practices of Viewing via the Ways of Doing videographic exercise Making Materiality Matter, the maker lets the seams show, inviting us to witness how meaning emerges through trying things out on the timeline. (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson (dis)Orientating Horror turns videographic process into a queer methodology. Also emerging from the Ways of Doing Making Materiality Matter exercise, the piece begins with a single disorienting moment from Midsommar and uses it as a generative prompt to think through horror’s habitual orientations. On the timeline, Donaldson works through this problem materially: flipping, mirroring, looping, and multiplying the image until the refusal of the ‘straight line’ becomes something you feel in your own body. The video lets us witness that process of trying, testing the film’s gestures against an idea of embodied cinema and experimenting toward a form that inhabits disorientation rather than resolving it. (dis)Orientating Horror is part of a fantastic special issue of Monstrum on Queer/ing Horror, among them Alison Peirse’s brilliant I Can Hear Someone Coming, a counterfactual, coital collection of women’s voices from 1930s horror films. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Shadow Self treats videographic criticism as an evolving process of attachment, tracing how certain films take hold of us and accompany us through our own lived rhythms. The seeds of this project were planted at the Embodying the Video Essay workshop held at Bowdoin College in 2023, and that lineage shows: the piece embraces embodiment as a mode of inquiry through voice, gesture, memory, and caregiving. Quraeshi Shepard weaves Varda’s Documenteur together with her own personal footage and audio of parent–child conversations, allowing the interruptions and digressions of connectivity to become structural rather than something to edit out. This is a work that lets process remain visible while asking what happens when scholarship, spectatorship, and parenthood meet on the timeline. Miradas by Pablo Serrano Torres Like Donaldson’s (dis)Orientating Horror, Serrano Torres’ Miradas embodies process not as a preliminary stage but as the very substance of queer videographic thinking. A peer of Quraeshi Shepard’s Shadow Self, Miradas is a work first conceived at the 2023 Embodying the Video Essay workshop and as a project of that context we can see that the piece moves deliberately from solitary introspection to collaborative creation, making the maker’s body, voice, and relationships integral to its argument. While engaging deeply with scholarly theory, Miradas refuses the straight line of academic seriousness; its process is the product. It is messy. It is embodied. It is communal. And it is joyful. AI and ‘Being Human’ by Mariam Khaled and Mahima Jain There is, perhaps correctly, a proliferation of pieces engaging with AI. I find works that engage with the process of using AI (e.g., a transparency of prompts or a reflection of interaction) to be far more interesting than displays of results. AI and ‘Being Human’ is such an endeavour, and a stake-holding one at that. It treats the desktop documentary not simply as a mode of presentation but as a process of decolonial unlearning. It highlights a way of making visible how AI technologies discipline and racialise our definitions of ‘the human’ by working through autoethnographic encounters with multiple AI platforms. Here we have the friction and ambivalence that occurs when AI flattens cultural complexity into sanitised universals. This is videographic criticism that does its thinking out loud. Comedy Objects #1: Slapstick Speculation by Noah Teichner Slapstick Speculation shows how videographic methodology can treat archival research not as raw material but as an imaginative, processual space for reanimating history. By blending 1930s comedy shorts, novelty songs, and monologues with speculative fiction, the piece reconstructs Hollywood’s shift to sound through the eyes and labor of comedy workers navigating the shocks of the 1929 Crash. While that is the conceptual background of the piece, for me I can feel how video thinks across media, revealing liveness as an intermedial effect shared by vaudeville, radio, early sound film, the stock ticker, and the choice of font and text-on-screen placement. Co-head of videoessays.org and director of Afterlives This year I was fortunate to be involved in some terrific videographic projects such as the NECSUS issue of video essays on the Locarno Film Festival and a programme of video essays on AI for the Jeu de Paume. Among the exceptional works from these projects, I want to celebrate The Water Diaries: A Letter to Jane by Chiara Grizzaffi, Algorithmic Borders by Silvia Cipelletti, Toute la data du monde by Evelyn Kreutzer, and not exactly a still life by Johannes Binotto. BLKNWS: Terms and Conditions by Khalil Joseph Like watching a videographic supernova, reaching for all the stars. Enjoy utopia whenever you find it. See Also: Slet 1988 by Marta Popidova happiness by Fırat Yücel A quintessentially 2025 video essay. See Also: Ask Me for Those Unborn Promises that May Seem Unlikely to Happen in the Natural by Donatella Della Ratta and The Void Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant A quietly radical mobilization of archival materials, creating fascinating associations between a life in film and with films. See Also: Animation in London/ Matchmove in Bangalore by Suryansu Guha Mechanical Kurds by Hito Steyerl AI cinema makes its strongest impact when it collides with its real life context, like a drone missile aimed at someone who programmed it. See Also: Their Eyes by Nicolas Gourault A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková, and Jiří Žák From the team that seems to be having the most fun making videographic scholarship these days. A toss-up with The Return of the Star Wipe but I went with this in solidarity with non-English-language video essays. See Also: Latencies of the Statistical Image by Roc Albalat Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre Most of the choices on my list demonstrate the possibilities of video essays exposed to realities beyond screens. This edu-activist YouTube video champions new possibilities for visibility, while also arguing for the virtues of staying unseen. See Also: Before the Drop by Rosa Wernecke A Life of Its Own: American Psycho by Sara Bezovšek It’s a self-contained rabbit hole. It’s a mock-fan website that holds a funhouse mirror to fan obsession. It’s a compilation of every meme that exists of a certain movie. It’s a critical retelling of that film through those memes. It’s also an installation that turns gallery spaces into sculptural doomscrolls. But… is it a video essay? There is an idea of a video essay. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real video essay. See Also: You Are Into Mousetrap Youtube by Big Joel Film critic and programmer – Cinemateca Portuguesa, IndieLisboa IFF Here are five films/videos, seen over the last year, that question our relationship with the ‘audiovisual’, with its simultaneous ability to reveal the nature of things and obscure their meaning. Soixante-sept millisecondes by Fleuryfontaine (Galdric Fleury and Antoine Fontaine) A film about trajectories, about bodies and projectiles in motion; it’s a film-denouncement, but it’s also a short treatise on the documental validity of moving images. Green Grey Black Brown by Yuyan Wang Meet Yuyan Wang, today’s most exciting video essayist. Each of her supercuts is a demonstration of the astonishing power of editing and the hypnotic potential of the ‘raccord’. Camera Test (King Cadbury) by Charlie Shackleton This year Charlie Shackleton made his new feature film, the intricate Zodiac Killer Project, but this short film is possibly his best film to date. Film archives and family memories merge with disarming simplicity. Being John Smith by John Smith The culmination of a body of work, the film that gives meaning and offers a retrospective review of a life (and a career). And it does so with the grace and self-deprecating humour that only a master is capable of mastering. 13 Alfinetes by João Pedro Rodrigues, João Rui Guerra da Mata Presented (still in a work-in-progress version) at the end of a retrospective that took place in Lisbon and Madrid, 13 Pins is, to a certain extent, the 8 ½ of João Pedro Rodrigues’s filmography. A film obsessed with circularity which, as a result, revolves simultaneously in a centripetal and centrifugal direction, closing the past and opening up the future. A Vida dos Espelhos by Saguenail and Regina Guimarães Created for the exhibition organised by the museum Casa do Cinema Manoel de Oliveira around the figure of Luis Miguel Cintra, A Vida dos Espelhos is based on a ten-hour interview between the actor and curator António Preto. It revisits the more than 20 films Cintra made with Manoel de Oliveira (plus some with Paulo Rocha), unfolding as an intricate interplay between what is spoken in voice-over and what the film excerpts reveal on screen. A meticulous revisiting of a stage-like oeuvre through the eyes of an actor formed equally by theatre and cinema – a journey of both confirmation and contradiction. Video essayist (as The Lesser Feat) and YouTube researcher who teaches Film & Television Studies at the University of Warwick All my chosen videos were published on YouTube (in some cases also Nebula), and made by non-academics. As a scholar of YouTube video essays, this seems my best chance to highlight a few different creators than some of my academic colleagues. While YouTube video essays can be about virtually any topic, I restrict myself to examples in which creators analyse at least one piece of screen media. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre Thrillingly experimental but accessible, deeply anxious but defiantly poised, this is a fascinating meditation on the politics of trans visibility in the second Trump era. Alexandre’s video probes this subject partly via film analyses (e.g.: We’re All Going to the World’s Fair), but more affectingly through its formal variety: an extreme-widescreen aspect ratio clashes with perversely restricted framings, handheld self-recordings of Alexandre fleeing riot police contrast steely surveillance-camera footage, guerilla street projection and more. All navigate in different ways the political potentials, dangers, and power of the camera’s gaze. My favourite YouTube video essay of the year by some margin; in fact, one of my screen media highlights of 2025, period. When Your Hero Is a Monster by The Leftist Cooks The Leftist Cooks are the Ireland-based married couple Sarah Oeffler and Neilly Farrell, and they make some of the most consistently aesthetically ambitious and intellectually thoughtful work in the field of what used to be called BreadTube (the loose collective of further-Left-than-liberal YouTube video essayists that flourished especially during the previous Trump presidency). Here they wrestle disarmingly honestly with the problem of beloved artists who reveal themselves as undeserving of their fans’ love (in this case, primarily Neil Gaiman), with characteristic humour, earnestness, insight, and creativity. You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel Illustrated with charming drawings by another underrated YouTuber, Mothcub, this short work about YouTube viewing habits might be considered more of an animated short story than a video essay. I’d put it differently: like (say) David Foster Wallace’s writing, which can dance between the modes of critical essay and literature, Big Joel here pushes the YouTube analytic-essayistic mode to its most literary and lyrical. Fear of Dark by Jacob Geller This is the latest in Geller’s Fear of… series, which explores the eerie fascination of environments associated with the limits of human sensory experience (it follows Fear of Cold, …of Depths, and …of Big Things Underwater). Drawing on a dizzying multitude of expressive uses of darkness in videogames, films and visual art, Geller’s atmospheric video also embodies its theme through its own photography: evocative experiments with unnervingly low light levels help conjure feelings of dread by testing his camera’s capacity to capture true darkness. The Unforgivable Sin of Ms Rachel by Lindsay Ellis One of the foundational voices of the YouTube video essay returned to the platform this year after a period during which she’s largely been making work for the creator-owned platform Nebula. The result was a classic, thoughtful Ellis breakdown of a cultural controversy, now applied to a weightier topic than usual: the backlash faced by children’s YouTuber Ms Rachel for her forthright support of Gaza. Her decision to publish it on YouTube has allowed the fundraiser Ellis attached to the video to raise over $800,000 for The Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund. Film critic The Body Hysteric by Cristina Álvarez López This, the best video essay of the year, was rejected by the Marienbad Festival selection committee. Their – and their audience’s – loss. Male Gazing by David Verdeure A remarkable, thoroughgoing and very intricate treatment of a classic film, Hitchcock’s Rear Window. See and hear things you never knew were there! Nebulous Encounters by Catherine Grant Two mighty scenes in fog, from Murnau’s Sunrise and Amenábar’s The Others. Arranged simply but eloquently across two screens. All cinema is here. Queer performance-based media artist, Montreal My picks reflect what excited me about video essay making this year and are by no means exhaustive. I look forward to watching works that others will share on this list that I don’t know. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre A thorough 48-minute rumination about the stakes of trans visibility for trans people, this longform work by YouTube essayist Lily Alexandre was warmly received when I saw it on the big screen at Montreal’s Exposures, Canada’s only trans film festival. At the centre of this piece is a question about trans visibility and whom it is for. Alexandre dives in deeply to offer insightful critique of trans film and media objects complemented and complicated by protest footage, surveillance, and nighttime monologues staged in quiet outdoor locations, all invoking concerns about public spaces, safety, and risk. Do yourself a favour: close your open tabs and apps, go full-screen, and give this remarkable work your full attention. See Under: Orient by Colleen Laird What an incredible video essay! Simply one of Colleen Laird’s best, See Under: Orient was made as part of One Hundred Movies Walk into a Bar… a summer 2025 collaborative videographic workshop organised by Ariel Avissar and Laird that responded to The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century list published by The New York Times. Laird structures her video essay around definitions of ‘orient’ (with reference to Ariel Avissar’s TV Dictionary format) and explodes our screen and speakers with a captivating soundtrack, stunning multiscreens (the vertical slices in the middle of the piece are particularly enthralling), heady Google Map zooms, and a brilliant use of text that selects and directs us to just how embedded Orientalist frameworks and biases are in film culture. Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant I learn so much from Catherine Grant every time I watch her work, and this piece co-created with film historian Melanie Bell about film continuity and the life and work of script supervisor Penny Eyles is no exception. A masterclass in video essay making, this video essay uses an intricate layout reminiscent of a video editing interface where we are challenged to decode Grant’s arrangement of scenes and sources as they play out, exemplifying Grant’s renowned engagement with material thinking. Centred around Sally Potter’s Orlando, Grant expertly takes us through the unseen labour of Eyles through archive, documentary, and extracted scenes from British films produced between 1943 and 2012. What a treat! (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson This award-winning video essay (Marienbad Film Festival, 2025) is a pleasure to watch. Fife Donaldson mirrors, flips, and layers landscape shots from horror films that fill the frame with a disorienting sense of foreboding made eerie and uncanny through repetition of sound and image. Fully interrogating Sara Ahmed’s work on queer orientation from her book Queer Phenomenology, Fife Donaldson artfully uses text on screen with a delicious colour palette that exemplifies its content. Full disclosure: this video essay appears in a special issue of Monstrum entitled Queer/ing Horror: Video Essays at the Intersection of Horror and Queerness, which I edited. I Can Hear Someone Coming by Alison Peirse Alison Pierse’s videographic work is always so meticulous, and this playful, provocative, joyful, queer video essay is no exception. She invites us to imagine if all women in 1930s horror were queer and proceeds to deliver this fantasy of their sexual arousal. Circular cut-outs act like peepholes into scenes that focus our attention onto key characters and their (now) queer actions. With scalpel-like precision, she extracts individual words, sentences, gasps, and exclamations to construct sexy sound bites of female desire in the body of the piece. Lavender text spells out this dialogue over lush vintage wallpaper. Such a delight! Full disclosure: this video essay also appears in a special issue of Monstrum entitled Queer/ing Horror: Video Essays at the Intersection of Horror and Queerness, which I edited. Backlot Connections by John Gibbs With an Easter egg tucked behind every turn, this video essay links an array of (mainly) 1950s films through their shared use of the Universal backlot, connecting seemingly disparate characters, scenarios, and plots to ultimately reveal their similarities. Gibbs unobtrusively uses an onscreen subtitle track to narrate his observations and guide us through the same American town square again and again. He maps fictional spaces onto real, reused set pieces that live just beyond the Los Angeles River, weaving together stories that happened across fictions and temporalities to invite us into this endlessly recycled town. Meet Part | Mothers Daughters by Viktoria Paranyuk Moments of longing, intimacy, trauma, and loss are connected in this moving video essay by Viktoria Paranyuk. She puts Chantal Akerman’s Meetings with Anna in onscreen conversation with Lana Gogoberidze’s Some Interviews on Personal Matters, foregrounding the filmmakers’ personal lives, histories, and relationships with their mothers and how this has shaped their films. Paranyuk uses grids and feminist diptychs to engage both films and their makers, what Paranyuk calls “empathetic engagement” with incredible success. Video essayist (as kikikrazed) and community manager for The Essay Library For my selections, I chose to highlight videos that inspired me as both a creator and viewer of video essays. A Video About Everything Except This Monument Hidden in the Bushes by Dime Store Adventures Dime Store Adventures is, to me, the best storyteller on YouTube right now. This video sets out to document the process of researching a monument in Rhode Island, but it evolves several times. I appreciate how much he shares about his thought process as both a researcher and video creator. Each new discovery makes the video better because he welcomes them instead of trying to bend his sources to fit a certain conclusion. There’s a reveal at the 19 minute mark that made me pause the video and immediately save it to my list for this poll. SE7EN & How 35mm Scans Lie to You by WatchingtheAerial I love how WatchingtheAerial often includes an activity related to the topic of each video essay. In this case, for a video about fan-made film scans and remasters, he makes some scans of his own to get a personal look at the process. This essay does a great job of explaining technical information in a clear and concise way. He provides a nuanced take on the ongoing debate surrounding the accuracy of different scans and releases, with a fun twist at the end. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms by Kendra Gaylord There’s no shortage of online discussion about the Backrooms, but Kendra Gaylord still manages to find something new to say. It’s a surprisingly funny exploration of the real building behind the famous Backrooms photo, packed with tons of information about the architectural developments that have occurred over the room’s lifetime. Every time I rewatch this video I learn something new thanks to Kendra’s genuine interest in digging up niche information and sharing it with the world. With the release of the upcoming A24 film The Backrooms, the concept is evolving from a collaborative storytelling exercise to a profitable venture. The Backrooms are about to change forever, so I appreciate how Kendra takes the opportunity to highlight the real building and memories that started it all. Why You Should WANT To Cite Your Sources by Dime Store Adventures I’m mentioning Dime Store Adventures again because I think this video does a great job of highlighting what’s wrong with the way many people talk about plagiarism on YouTube. He argues that many creators cite their sources primarily to avoid being accused of plagiarism (a reoccurring scandal on the platform) instead of recognising the actual benefit that good citation practices have. This video should be required viewing for anyone incorporating research in their videos. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) “Humans call, and humans answer.” This essay itself is endlessly inspiring, but what I find especially motivating is the response it received. In the comments section I noticed that it was many viewers’ first introduction to the world of desktop documentaries – and they were so excited to discover the format! If you spend a lot of time releasing videos on YouTube, you start to feel weighed down by the pressure to ‘play it safe’ or risk losing favour in the eyes of the indecipherable algorithm. The response to this video essay proves that YouTube audiences have an appetite for more creativity and experimentation on the platform. Co-editor and co-founder, [in]Transition This list will largely consist of works published in [in]Transition given how much time and bandwidth viewing and reviewing submissions takes. Needless to say, I’m excited to see the selections of my colleagues and peers that will introduce me to pieces I missed given that blindspot. On Listening by Pavitra Sundar I had always imagined that it would be difficult to make a video essay analysing how sound functions in film given the medium’s skew towards visual information. Pavitra Sundar’s video On Listening challenged my own lack of imagination with its poetic exploration. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková There’s a running concern I tend to have about our field – that the texts videographic critics tend to privilege are canonical works by esteemed auteurs (I’m guilty of it too). In this context, Anger and Hanáková’s insightful exploration of the star wipe reminds us that serious analysis can account for the derided as well… sometimes even playfully. Crochet Is Sick! by Alison Peirse Alison Peirse showcases such an intuitive sense of rhythm and clip selection in her supercuts that it sometimes takes me multiple screenings to fully appreciate the argument they present because I’m so transfixed by their aesthetics. Crochet Is Sick!, like her previous work Knit One, Stab Two, continues her exploration of gender and the horror genre, but she finds significant deviations and fresh terrain here. Plus I always end up with a list of more horror flicks to check out by the end of her pieces, which is always a win. Film teacher and researcher at Escola das Artes in Católica University (O Porto); film programmer; film critic at À pala de Walsh website Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory Maryam Tafakory’s essayistic cinema germinates from observation, a meticulous look at the past of her art, detecting images that remain to be made, imagined. However, it would be simpler to fill these gaps with parallel fictions. This is not her method: counter-imagination is filmed on the back of these very painful images, as if inviting the viewer to turn the past of Iranian cinema inside out and see new possibilities. In Daria’s Night Flowers, Tafakory ‘demands’ the images of oppressed and desperate women from post-revolution Iranian cinema to tell us about the possibility of an impossible queer love, and in this colourful, blossoming gesture, we are simultaneously seeing the prison bars and the freedom that the palimpsest points to. Kelly Reichardt’s Bestiario by Celia Sainz Celia Sainz is interested in exploring the notion of videographic ecocriticism, not only as thematic exploration but as an ontological gesture. Is the critical operation that acts directly on the structure of a film a way of revealing the fragility of the boundaries that insist on dividing things? Kelly Reichardt’s Bestiary is a three-part essay that operates this fragmentation within the American director’s body of work, but does so from a directional logic. To where do our eyes turn to? In the first segment, Birds Eye Views, we look up, where the life of birds challenges us in movement and sound. In the last segment, Ground Dog Day, we remain horizontal, close to the ground, in this communion on soil between humans (other beings) and dogs. In the middle of this gesture, No(Hu)Man’s Land, Sainz positions humans among other existences, revealing themselves among shots of segmented bodies that are becoming across the technological, the synthetic and the biological. In this case, videographic ecocriticism is a way to pierce through and connect the unconnected. Om Shanti Omnibus by International Video Essay Research Network (IVERN) In video essays, there is a ‘profane’ gesture towards the uniqueness and integrity of the work. Perhaps this premise makes videographic criticism an appropriate method for thinking about the decentering of authorial unity and the collaborative approach. Twelve members of the International Video Essay Research Network (IVERN) divided up a film they were unfamiliar with – Om Shanti Om (Farah Khan, 2007) – and, working on a specific segment, they had to obey specific parameters. The use of text on screen, voiceover, epigraph, multiscreen, superimposition, music/sound only from film, music/sound from external source, self-filmed footage (including desktop), footage from another source, repetition, unusual transitions and speed. The end result is fascinating: a cadavre exquis that is not just a compilation but a suggestion for mapping pedagogical possibilities in the teaching and practice of audiovisual essayism. The dissemination of perspectives on Khan’s film and the multiplication of digital impressions placed over the original give this exercise a true sense of decentralised criticism, of perspectives signed simultaneously from places of proximity, distance and collaboration. Hands Off, Eyes On by Donatella Della Ratta, R. Alessandro Turchioe, and Sofia Busquets Hands Off, Eyes On, by Donatella Della Ratta, R. Alessandro Turchioe and Sofia Busquets, is an intelligent video essay that exposes the tensions inherent in activism, in the distinction between the eye and the hand. Between visibility with transformative potential and the hypothetical limitations of that hand and the (im)possibility of art to have an immediately transformative impact. Hands Off, Eyes On takes a critical look at media, its reception, and the visibility market of festivals. Behind the screens, in their shadows, the films and words printed on the wall continue (contradict) the privileged space of cinema. Abbas Kiarostami: A Transversal Filmography by Cristian Tormo Cristian Tormo’s, Abbas Kiarostami: A Transversal Filmography brilliantly shows how a filmmaker can advance in his themes from film to film. The work expands, becomes more complex, branches out. The work grows up, like the characters in these films. Kiarostami is a key author for understanding the relationship between cinema and growing up, especially in the transition from childhood to adolescence. This video essay shows how, although the theme remains the same, the strategies for filming the problems of growing up change as the dilemmas transform and the world expands. Fading Echoes: Remembering and Forgetting through Videotapes by Vladimir Rosas-Salazar Nothing escapes deterioration. At the same time, everyone tries to resist it. Vladimir Rosas-Salazar uses home videos that his family recorded in the 1990s and 2000s in this video essay. Personal videos promised to build an archive as resistance to the loss of organic memory. Like with film. And as will probably happen with digital data. Rosas-Salazar uses the marks of the media, of its decay, its palimpsest, not only to suggest this fragility to us, but to reflect on the fallibility of memory. The imperfection of the media is perhaps the best match for the imperfection of memory: both recover, create and slowly fade away. The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning by João Araújo A brief editing exercise: hypnotic, simple, about to be lost. Of all the techniques that audiovisual essays can use, editing, as the beginning of a conversation with cinema, retains a mysterious form. In Araújo’s The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning, we glide through the fragility of the end of something that always restarts. The moving image of cinema symbolises this life, this fluidity, which lies between the elements, between the liquid and the weight of the fruit. In the midst of our gaze, everything falls, gravity is complete. But soon, everything rises again. It is the brilliance of cinema, which links causes, that makes death impermanent. As Marcus Aurelius wrote: “All things are implicated in one another and in sympathy with each other. This event is the consequence of some other one. Things push and pull on each other, and breathe together, and are one.” YouTube-based video essayist Why Did UK Crisp Packets Swap Colours? by Chris Spargo While many people attribute Spargo’s meteoric rise in 2025 to the absence of household name Tom Scott, I think that’s doing him a bit of a disservice. He’s his own creator, in both personality and subject matter. Answering the question that you’ve always wondered, but been too afraid to ask, Why Did UK Crisp Packets Swap Colours? weaves a five-minute tale of corporate battles and tragedy, while also overlapping with the “Maths is blue instead of yellow” niche. There really is something for everyone here. Wacky History of Computer Scrabble by Junferno It’s easy to get distracted by Junferno from the Junferno YouTube Channel’s fast paced editing and deadpan humour without realising that you’re actually learning University-level Computer Science. Wacky History of Computer Scrabble is a dense dive into something that, on the surface, should be quite simple. It’s Scrabble, after all — you’ve played Scrabble, right? Yet, in between quips and jokes that you can only make sense of five seconds after he’s told them, you’ll learn that computers are really weird and Scrabble is really complicated and they also called one of the models for playing a word a “dawg”. That’s pretty funny. Games About Concrete by Puddle If we subscribe to the popular 2007 animated film Ratatouille’s idea of “a great chef can come from anywhere”, then Puddle’s Games About Concrete is proof that it can apply to the world of Video Essays as well. Sitting at a YouTube subscriber count of double digits, Puddle’s video is a both bleak and uplifting dive into a series of games about concrete and the sublime, harrowing, fantastical feelings they evoke. While many creators leave no stone unturned in their coverage, Puddle is not afraid to let the video breathe and to let the games speak for themselves, leaving the interpretation up to the viewer. PhD student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre Lily Alexandre’s work has maintained a reliable spot on my list since 2023, and this year was no different. Trans Day of Vanishing is a chilling (literally, in some shots), haunting, incisive reflection on contemporary trans visibility, and it’s one of her best videos to date. You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel Written and delivered by Big Joel and animated delightfully by Mothcub, this video isn’t really about mousetraps or YouTube, but it’s also about both? Or possibly neither. Either way, I found it terrifying and wonderful. The Unforgivable Sin of Ms Rachel by Lindsay Ellis I suspect that I won’t be the only person to put this rare ‘Lindsay Ellis returns to YouTube’ video on my list, so I won’t belabor the point with a woefully incomplete description or justification. This video made me laugh, and cry, and cry, and cry, and it is worth watching again. Academic filmmaker and Associate Professor of film and media at Aarhus University My impression is that the scholarly video essay in 2026 has achieved something like self-assurance. Perhaps institutional recognition of video essay practice has become more established; certainly, some of the innovations of the past 15 years have been integrated and even somewhat routinised. Catherine Grant’s influence seems to me pervasive, particularly the example of her epigraphic work and deployment of soft montage. Grant’s own videos made with collaborators this year – Pausas/Pauses with Rachel Randall, and Making Fiction Flow with Melanie Bell – and the response she made for a collection of video essays edited by Joel Burges and Allison Cooper (ASAP Review, December 2024), are themselves magisterial consolidation of the rhetoric Grant has evolved over a decade and a half. I would place such works in a strand of videographic criticism that suggests the form is uniquely equipped for the reflexive activation of the archive, a strand that stretches from videos like Between Magic and Realism from Kathleen Loock’s Hollywood Memories project, through John Gibbs’ Backlot Connections, to Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková’s The Return of the Star Wipe and Mathias Bonde Korsgaard’s The History of Music Video in 169 Seconds. The ambition of such work also begins to suggest the capacity of videographic criticism to devote sustained attention to themes and phenomena. The two volumes published so far in the Lever Press videographic book series – Jason Mittell on Breaking Bad and Gregory Brophy and Shawn Malley on contemporary science fiction – are the standouts here, of course. (Interestingly, both programmatically employ a range of videographic modes, suggesting that videographic criticism per se is as core a concern as the declared topics.) Series like Johannes Binotto’s Gestures of Thought (among them the uncanny Swallow) and Alison Peirse’s supercut treatments of horror cinema (for example, Crochet Is Sick!) also prove the cumulative power of analysis across multiple videos. Conversely, Christian Keathley’s teasing and complex one-hour Cinephilia and History is a single but monograph-equivalent video essay that demonstrates the intellectual sophistication of which videographic criticism is capable. It also represents an alternative mode of videographic work that foregrounds the body of the maker, albeit in a very different register from that of Dayna McLeod, the preeminent practitioner in this ‘somatic’ mode (see Potbelly). McLeod refers to herself as a ‘performance artist’; I think we need the term ‘performance academic’ to capture the distinctiveness of some of the work being produced. I mention all these essayists and strands they represent because the richness and quantity of work in the field makes choosing ever harder for the purpose of this poll. My ‘official’ selection below expresses my sense of the self-assurance and consolidation in scholarly videographic criticism mentioned above. But it also appreciates the continued experimentation with the video essay form that, I’m glad to say, frustrates the synthesising impulse motivating this introductory paragraph. Contemptuous Chess: A Moving Poem by Drew Morton Contemptuous Chess is a contribution to Evelyn Kreutzer’s Moving Poems project, in which makers are invited to pair “a single poem or multiple poems […] with a single or multiple moving-image media text(s) […]”. Morton puts three texts into dialogue: Alberto Moravia’s novel Il disprezzo (Contempt, 1954), about a playwright who reluctantly adapts The Odyssey for the screen, Godard’s film adaptation of that novel, Le Mépris (Contempt, 1963), and Rosario Castellanos’s poem Chess (1972). The result is a masterclass in pacing, on-screen text, and the orchestration of voices, other sound and music. With readings of Castellanos’s poem in four languages, it applies the lessons of Barbara Zecchi’s thinking on the ‘accented video essay’ and presents adaptation itself as an accented practice. Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place by Catalina Segú I thought Joel Burges and Allison Cooper’s cluster of video essays entitled The Personal Mediascape in the Age of Videographic Heterotopias was extremely well conceived and produced (full disclosure: I was invited – and delighted – to compose a video response). Among the uniformly superb videos in the collection, I think I have watched most often Catalina Segú’s Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place, which deals with the personal and cultural legacies of the Chilean dictatorship. This formally and thematically ambitious video essay reveals new connections with each viewing, and I use it regularly now in class to show how complexity and ambivalence can be managed and enacted as videographic thought. The ParAIax View by Ariel Avissar I think Ariel Avissar won’t mind if I describe The ParAlax View as the ugliest video essay of 2025. It’s also one of the year’s most intellectually intriguing. The video is a shot-for-shot AI remake of the ‘brainwashing montage’ from Alan J. Pakula’s The Parallax View (1974) in which the original images are replaced by slop approximations generated by Picsart, themselves based on prompts elicited from ChatGPT. Avissar also composes the creator statement in iterative and avowed collaboration with ChatGPT, and includes interpolations from an unnamed peer reviewer. The combination of video essay and unstably authored text self-consciously takes forward videographic criticism as a distributed and cyborg scholarly practice. Sound Stack, Soundwalk, Southworth by Cormac Donnelly I may be cheating by nominating Cormac Donnelly’s Sound Stack, Soundwalk, Southworth. This is not a single video essay but a portfolio of three videos containing a video analysis of a soundscape in Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007), a methodological tutorial on imaging techniques borrowed from Kevin Ferguson, and the recording of a soundwalk Donnelly took through Boston, for a total of 134 minutes. As with Ariel Avissar’s video and statement, Donnelly’s portfolio insists on videographic scholarship as a distributed and compound practice, and argues against conceptions of the video essay as an autonomous or self-contained form. I’m delighted to see Donnelly picking up the idea of ‘luxury scholarship’, in which making and method are indulged for their own sake. At the same time, Donnelly’s challenge to the ‘visual prejudice’ in film studies salutarily reprises a strand of important work by the great Liz Greene, and resonates with recent work on sound by scholar-makers like Pavitra Sundar (On Listening) and Annalisa Pellino (the forthcoming Becoming-Voice). Object Oriented Breaking Bad by Jason Mittell I take advantage of the publication in late 2024 of Jason Mittell’s videographic book, The Chemistry of Character in Breaking Bad, to nominate a video essay that has circulated for some years. I think Object Oriented Breaking Bad is a key work in the field. It shows how deformative methods can analytically grasp aspects of long-form texts hidden in plain sight, surfacing textures of world-building and the more-than-human. It suggests the potential for videographic practice to allow non-human entities to ‘speak’ in what we can imagine with Bruno Latour as a ‘Parliament of Things’ – a forum in which objects and ecologies find political representation alongside citizens and societies. An Accented Video Way of Thinking: Becoming videoessay by Barbara Zecchi Drawing on thinkers like Deleuze and Hamid Naficy, and on theories of the accent as a mode of thought rather than just speech, Barbara Zecchi’s meta-video contrasts the ‘videoessay’ (she insists on the single word), as an ‘accented’ form of criticism, with traditional, purportedly ‘accent-less’ scholarship. This is playful but challenging work: I may even have overheard Prof. Zecchi suggest that, on rewatching the videoessay, she found she couldn’t quite follow it, despite having made it herself. This is as it should be. Please don’t mention this to Prof. Zecchi, but I prefer this mode in her work to the more crowd-pleasing and easily legible achievement of a video like The Rhythms of Rage. The work we do should exceed and elude us. ‘Predictable Unpredictability’– Dynamic Embodied Patterns in Miklós Jancsó’s Film Style by Miklós Kiss and Maarten Coëgnarts Miklós Kiss and Maarten Coëgnarts would certainly disagree with what I have just written. Miklós Kiss has been resolute in arguing the distinction between videographic research method and communication mode, and has insisted on the need to be ‘clear’ in scholarly video essays. Accordingly, Predictable Unpredictability is exemplary in its explanatory clarity. Kiss and Coëgnarts show how complex frame and figure movement in Miklós Jancsó, hard to grasp by traditional analytical means, can be captured and analysed by merging animated diagrams and film extracts. In working audiovisually to offer a precise account of an aspect of Jancsó’s style, Kiss and Coëgnarts have expanded the rhetoric and capacities of videographic criticism. Video essayists and political activists We try to avoid hierarchies so this exercise was a challenge. We picked essays which each exemplified a different aspect of the artform. Doubtlessly, there are other equally beautiful essays from this year, but these are the ones that stuck with us. The Alt-Right Playbook: The South Bank of the Rubicon by Innuendo Studios For years now, Innuendo Studios has put out videos starting with a hypothetical, “Say, for the sake of argument”. This video, apparently the last in the series, does not start that way. Instead it starts with gentle sound design, and an unexpected introduction. This essay is a plea, and it will be a time capsule. It asks the audience to take stock in the moment they’re in, as they watch a dark history unfold. It makes salient the emotional turmoil of experiencing politics, with an eerily gentle tone. Fascists Will Waste Your Time. by Thought Slime Thought Slime uses comedy to be very clear, and uses clarity to be shatteringly funny. As with most of their videos, the tone is intentionally unpretentious. Thought Slime puts forth an argument about the best way to speak to unapologetic fascists, which is not to speak to them at all. Behind her humour is unimpeachable logic, and Mildred’s persona is thoroughly enjoyable company, even with what should be a grim topic. DIY HRT: Everything I Can Legally Tell You by Lily Alexandre This video is praxis; and not in some fuzzy sense in which art inspires revolutions, but in the simple and straightforward sense that the work itself will tangibly help people. We would not be surprised to see other works from Lily on this list, and comparatively this work may seem somewhat unassuming. But it is the work we have forwarded to people who are in desperate positions, having to manage their own healthcare. There is real bravery in using a platform like YouTube to spread information to marginalised people, and Lily does so with her usual mastery of the medium. Brat and the Culture of Addiction by Alexander Avila An Alexander Avila video sometimes feels like taking an interesting philosophy class, complete with pop culture references, swish lighting, perfect music and sprinkles of queer innuendo. This video in particular showcases Alex’s ability to compose a narrative with a dizzying array of elements. He takes real risks. At one point in his piece, Alex breaks all the rules of YouTube and filmmaking and addresses the audience directly in a pointed staring contest. Not just anticipating the audience’s discomfort, but triggering it intentionally, watching you with folded arms as time passes. Much of the video feels uncomfortable, and yet it’s a work we’ve watched more than once. For such a demonstration of virtuosity it also has such heart. The ‘War’ in Gaza Is Not Really Taking Place by chriswaves Chriswaves is the mercurial personification of internet culture; he has emerged as one of the most unique and insightful voices covering the intersection of technology, alienation, and capitalist exploitation. His work is slick, catchy, and meticulously edited. In this essay, he applies Jean Baudrillard’s and Achille Mbembe’s work to the conflict in Gaza, and highlights the throughline from small acts of capitalistic exploitation to terrifying state violence. It’s haunting without being voyeuristic, academic while still feeling urgent. And most importantly, it somehow ends on a plea for hope. Chris’s work is both innovative and familiar, a reminder of what is uniquely good about this genre. Video essayist, community manager for the Essay Library, Yu-Gi-Oh player Being a manager for the Essay Library, a Discord server for up-and-coming video essayists, I tend to come into contact with a lot of video essays from… up-and-coming video essayists. It’s wonderful to see the payoff for videos when I’ve seen firsthand the amount of work that has gone into them, and the source of various artistic choices taken in their creation. My submissions include some highlights of those from this year. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) Rarely do you come across a video that makes you feel the kind of joy you get from just being a human. This video from Josh showcases this joy in one of its most basic forms: communication. He refutes the value of AI writing from the idea that the purpose of writing is to meet with another person, and reflects the personal side of this issue by drawing upon his experiences with his friends and as an English professor to back up his points. This essay is both deeply intimate and extremely relevant to an important issue impacting our cultural landscape. Storytime Animation Doesn’t Feel Relatable Anymore by comma splice This first video from comma splice explores the transformation of the YouTube genre of storytime animation. These videos usually reflect on one’s lived experience – they tend to change quite a bit in style and substance as their creators grow from hobbyists to the owners of small production companies. Though comma splice’s essay functions as a critique, it comes from a place of love for the genre, and it can easily be seen in their self-made avatar which meshes wonderfully with the style of the videos they critique. I hope to see more of their work in the future. Change-Makers: Opposing Fascism In Daily Life by Afterthoughts This is one of a couple of videos in a series by Afterthoughts, which seeks to showcase actionable goals people strive for when trying to resist the current political landscape. A common critique of leftist video essays is that while they often seek to inform people of issues in society, they don’t often provide a guide for solving the problem. Change-Makers has this missing information in spades, tackling tactics like civil disobedience or protesting often through the lens of three different archetypes of activist that they define. This information is something that I think many people sorely need at the moment, and Afterthoughts is doing a fantastic job at presenting it! How to Reduce Salt by Core-A GamingMy favourite aspect of Core-A Gaming is that while his videos are incredibly applicable to his chosen subject of fighting games, they usually extend to the general mindset approaching competition. In this video, he examines techniques used in cognitive behavioral therapy to create a healthier mindset towards approaching competition, which is an issue that many people struggle with from my own experience. I love the way he incorporates interviews he conducts with top players from various games to back up his points, easily bridging the gap from theoretical to practical. Professor of Film Studies, University of Leeds Videographic criticism is feeling its archival fantasy in 2025. Check out Ellen Nolan’s The Nita Harvey Archive for Screenworks, Amanda Doxtater’s Epitaph for Sonja 1: Body/Archive/Movement in ASAP-Review, Viktoria Paranyuk’s Meet Part | Mothers Daughters in Apparatus, and the wonderful Movie dossier Audiovisual Approaches and the Archive. I remain, as ever, obsessed with archives, film history, and feelings. This (magnificent) obsession is evidenced with great beauty and clarity in the work I have selected: Zodiac Killer Project by Charlie Shackleton when the archive denies your desires AGENCIA by May Santiago when the archive cannot hold you Okay Keskidee! Let Me See Inside by Rhea Storr when film builds new archives They’re Just Hands! by Dayna McLeod when film is reimagined as an archive of love Video essayist You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) There are many videos dissecting the numerous problems with AI but none have inspired me to be a better human and friend like this thoughtful exploration of communication and art. be your own algorithm by pagemelt A rare criticism of algorithms that keeps its critique aimed where it belongs while being a love letter to humanity and art in ways that are often dismissed in other critiques of our online spaces controlled by corporations. I Saw the TV Glow: CRT Memories and Fuzzy Genders by AdequateEmily A masterful analysis that weaves in the personal from herself and other trans people to poignantly touch on why this film had such an impact for many of us, myself included. WARFRAME 1999 is Absurdly Punk Rock by SocraTetris I found myself loving a game that I knew nearly nothing about going in. A thoughtful examination of what a piece of art has to say when we consider its cultural context in a moment in time with an emphatically punk rock conclusion. What I Learned Photographing NPCs in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth by SolidArf A beautiful exploration of the little details in massive AAA games through a lens of his love of photography which brings appreciation to elements of the art form often overlooked. How Galileo Broke the Scientific Method by Dr Fatima An ideological breakdown of how science itself is often discussed and perceived gives us much to think about how we go about acquiring knowledge. Dr Fatima’s end of video discussions are also a welcome addition that not only build on her points but something we rarely see on YouTube. Sinners and the Death of Black Art by F.D. Signifier Manages to take a beloved piece of media and uses it to interrogate a double consciousness that exists when creating media within systems that are antagonistic to those making the media. Video essayist on YouTube Regrettably, this selection is limited to the YouTube video essay sphere, as I’m not familiar enough with the wider landscape to be much use beyond it. That being said, I’m very happy to share some of the great video work I’ve been fortunate enough to see on that platform this year! We’ve forgotten how to forget. by josh (with parentheses) This one flew way under the radar. Josh’s piece goes down an elegantly presented and deeply compelling rabbit hole, starting with a few confusing frames of 1995’s A Goofy Movie, moving through questions of medium, cartography, and even Disney lore, ending on a recognition of what we’ve lost as online viewers – the ability “to love a thing and let it go”. Scratch the surface, and many of our present moment’s distressing realities feel like knock-on effects of this principle, of the way the internet lets any discussion carry on, intensify, and ferment forever. The alt-right wouldn’t have formed if they’d had to GamerGate in person. There’d be no basilisks or longtermism addling the minds in charge of our economies had LessWrong been a coffee shop. This essay isn’t about either of those things – it’s about a weird map in A Goofy Movie! – but our journey down that rabbit hole is very much situated in the concerns of 2025. You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel Is this even a video essay? Is it a visual poem, instead? What’s the difference? I’m not sure. Whatever this is, Big Joel has produced an obliquely evocative video that examines cruelty, interpersonal boundaries, the intimacy of viewing, the way every surface on a platform like YouTube is, in some way, a slippery slope. This one rewards repeat viewings, and is gorgeously animated by mothcub. Fantasies of Nuremberg by Jacob Geller How do you make video essays while the world is falling apart? It’s a question many prominent creators in this space have wrestled with in recent times. Some answers have been better than others. From a formal perspective, Fantasies of Nuremberg is a more straightforward essay than many of Geller’s, except when it’s not. It takes the viewer along in a journey from despair, to confusion, to rage, and back again. Revenge is too much, and not enough. Justice is elusive. This is a knotty essay. The knots remain largely intact at its end, but handling them together for 40 or so minutes does result in a sort of affirmation. The Ten Traits of Slop Content by Ro Ramdin This is, as one YouTube commenter puts it, “A very thorough thesis on stuff that kinda evades thoroughness.” Slop is one of those terms that came out of nowhere and shot straight into the dominant vocabulary of the internet. For the past year or so, it’s been very hard to talk online about art or content without having to contend with this word in some way. Many of us have attempted to define what people are trying to convey with the term, and most of us have failed. Not Ro Ramdin. By avoiding direct definition and instead lasering in on the ways we talk about slop, the voices leading that conversation, and the social, cultural and technological contexts we’re doing slop ‘discourse’ within, Ramdin takes us right to its heart. It’s an uneasy, sickly sweet journey. Are Americans Irish? by The Leftist Cooks There are very few essayists I’ll drop whatever I’m doing to catch up on. The Leftist Cooks are among that number, and this essay is a great example of why. Honestly, all their essays are – I could have picked any of their releases from the past 12 months here. Neilly and Sarah are masters of the long-form video essay. It’s not easy to dive as deep into a question as the pair do here while keeping that exploration fresh, thought-provoking, and authentic (trust me, I’ve tried). Are Americans Irish? does all this and more, zooming through history, film, politics, philosophy, and personal experience to end up interrogating the very idea of identity. Head of Film Programming & Distribution, Eye Filmmuseum Dracula by Radu Jude Outrageous essay film on AI, the bloodsucker of our times. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory Pretty sure I picked a film by Maryam Tafakory every time I participated in this poll. Masterful as always. Remembering Otherwise by belit sağ A performative reading in the cinema inviting the audience to analyse the same few seconds of footage in different ways, based on a broader project on a 1978 labour strike in Veghel, the Netherlands, led by Turkish migrant women. happiness by Fırat Yücel Ancestral Visions of the Future by Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese Their Eyes by Nicolas Gourault BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions by Kahlil Joseph Audiovisual PhD student and Film & TV Placement Coordinator at the University of Birmingham In no particular order, these all made it onto a handy notepad this year, under the heading ’video essays to watch again’. Enjoy! Backlot Connections by John Gibbs As an actor plays different parts, so the backlot portrays different places, yet fundamentally remains itself. A fascinating study of how seemingly separate narratives and characters’ lives converge on and around the Universal Backlot. Arkiv Avis Mor (Archive Newspaper Mother) by Marie Hallager Andersen I found this utterly captivating and original. Marie Hallager Andersen weaves together a whale, old newspaper, home videos, dance performances, projection, questions about archives and bodies, and so much more. Beautiful storytelling that ruminates on motherhood, memory and movement. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková Meticulously researched, so fun to watch and a perfectly realised retro aesthetic throughout that is anything but gimmicky in its execution. <applause> Lost in Grand Central by Joel Blackledge Clever interplay of text and image showcases the incongruity between Hollywood superstars and a British city widely denigrated for its looks, as well as the confusion many have experienced in and around Birmingham New Street Station and Grand Central shopping centre. I wish I’d made this! Mapping Roma by Jessica Wax-Edwards An embodied exploration into the filming locations of Roma which uses superimposition to great effect, highlighting the complexities of representing ‘real’ places on screen, both past and present, and how film location tourists may experience them. Filler Words by Ian Garwood Entertaining and subtly provocative, this certainly gave me ‘pause for thought’. Crochet Is Sick! by Alison Peirse So well crafted (excuse the pun), I can’t look at crocheted blankets or shawls in any screen context now without wondering what impending horrors may await. Building on her previous video essay ‘Knit One, Stab Two’ – though this also works strongly as a standalone piece – Alison Peirse champions the crucial work of the Art Department and Wardrobe. Freelance critic, former associate editor for documentary at Hyperallergic Henry Fonda for President by Alexander Horwath The best theatrically released essay film I’ve seen this year. Henry Fonda, it turns out, works very well as both a metonym and a contrast with America and its history. Everyone Is Cheating at Chess (Allegedly) by Sarah Z Extremely fun and funny video about people going to extremes to cheat, which also is a useful look at how changing technology and social mores have caused the storied strategy game’s meta, social role, and psychogeographic environment to evolve. Why Movies Just Don’t Feel ‘Real’ Anymore by Like Stories of Old There’s been a lot of discourse about digital sheen and changing production models and how it’s affected cinema aesthetics. This, more than any other video or single article, works perfectly as a succinct way to explain to those who might not get it just what we’re talking about. The Wizard of Oz at Sphere Is Nightmare Fuel by Be Kind Rewind ChatGPT Made Me Delusional by Eddy Burback Disney’s Living Characters: A Broken Promise by Defunctland Video essayist and PhD How to Spot a Bad Critic by Accented Cinema The rise of independent creators on online platforms like YouTube has, for all its benefits, also led to a collapse in quality control. Virtually anyone can upload a video of insubstantial analysis or bad-faith criticism and call it a video essay. How to Spot a Bad Critic offers a useful framework for viewers to recognise poor criticism when they see it. It is also a good video for fellow essayists, a standard for us to hold ourselves to. Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Biopic You’re Not Allowed to See… by Be Kind Rewind Be Kind Rewind’s recounting of Superstar’s production, legacy, and legal troubles would be worthy of consideration on the strength of its writing and research alone, but it’s the videomaking which makes the work transcendent. Just as Todd Haynes used Barbie dolls to re-enact the life story of Karen Carpenter, so too does Isabel Custodio use Barbie dolls to tell the story of Haynes and his film. Formally ambitious and substantial. How David Lynch Saw the Bright Side by Broey Deschanel Doubling as a thoughtful analysis of David Lynch’s artistry and a moving tribute to a much beloved filmmaker, Deschanel’s video essay explores familiar aspects of Lynch’s work to arrive at an unexpected and underdiscussed conclusion. How Comedy Was Destroyed by an Anti-Reality Doomsday Cult by The Elephant Graveyard Most of The Elephant Graveyard’s video work has been dedicated to critiquing the modern comedy sphere dominated by Joe Rogan and his expanded circle. This video is his magnum opus. A damning portrait of how thoroughly MAGA politics and its figureheads have infiltrated pop culture through the guise of comedy that is also far funnier than any of the so-called comedians highlighted. Why the Terminator Uses a Phone Book by Jesse Tribble In an era of multi-hour deep dives, it’s refreshing to see a video essayist tackle something so small and seemingly inconsequential. In just under five minutes, Jesse offers a compelling read of the phone book as plot device in The Terminator, incorporating the conventions of genre cinema and even the history of the telephone itself in his analysis. PragerU’s Terrible Shakespeare Opinions, or Why I Stopped Talking About Shakespeare by Kyle Kallgren Stunning. More than just a cutting retort to PragerU’s bigotry and anti-intellectualism, this video essay thoroughly dismantles the notion that any artwork or artist can truly transcend the political and material realities in which they exist. Kyle Kallgren has since announced his retirement from videomaking on YouTube and this swan song is a reminder of how vital he’s been to the medium. Witty, rigorously researched, and willing to sit within uncomfortable complexities, this is an essential video essay. modern masculinity and The Critical Drinker by Man Carrying Thing Videos critiquing/debunking the bad film analysis of rage-bait YouTubers like The Critical Drinker have become a popular sub-genre on Film YouTube in recent years. But Man Carrying Thing zeroes in on a less-often discussed aspect of such channels: their appallingly lazy video editing. Video editor and podcast host How Comedy Was Destroyed by an Anti-Reality Doomsday Cult by The Elephant Graveyard In-depth verbal evisceration of Rogan and his orbiters. What Are ‘White People Tacos’? by Internet Shaquille Direct, succinct, funny, and insightful video about white people tacos and how they differ from their traditional Mexican counterparts. The Labubu Chronicles by Ro Ramdin Cultural commentary, poem, and opulent visual art feast all in one. ChatGPT Made Me Delusional by Eddy Burback What better way to demonstrate ChatGPT’s corrosive mental effects than to present it with one foundational delusion that it then runs with and builds upon to an astonishing degree? Filmmaker, author, video essayist I’ve never needed new ways of thinking than I do now. I live in hope for the next generation, that we may yet find the Godard of video essays Spectateurs! by Arnaud Desplechin Everything an essay should be: personal, beautiful, thoughtful, and Mathieu Amalric shows up. Disney’s Animatronics: A Living History by Kevin Perjurer Nothing like getting enchanted by a Defunctland piece I Fell in Love with a Quebec Reality Dating Show by Derin Emre Spritely and openhearted The Queen is Dead: Trans, Queer, and Femme Image in Last Exit to Brooklyn by Willow Maclay and Kat Ellinger A great probing look at a history still being discovered The Purplettes: The Room Next Door by Green and Red A lovely cubist deconstruction of a work that flows so effortlessly past its details. Making us better understand how an artist tells a story of death’s complications. Video essayist and independent scholar Breaking The Creepy AI in Police Cameras by Benn Jordan I asked the question “What is Cinema?” a lot this year. The primary site of screen reception is no longer the theatre or even the television, but rather everywhere else there’s a screen – phones, ATMs, rear-facing cameras on your car. Cinema is everywhere and nowhere. But more importantly, the camera itself no longer primarily resides in Hollywood or TV studios or even in your pocket, but in the vast array of always-on surveillance systems blanketing corporate and government buildings, roadsides, and doorbells, outfitted with licence plate readers and facial recognition AI, and piping all that visual and telemetric data into the hard drives of police, ICE, and privately-owned data brokers. What is cinema? Nowadays, it’s the surveillance grid. And so if we’re going to make meaningful video essays about seeing-knowledge-power in the world today, they’d better be interventions into that surveillance grid. And NO ONE this year has more meaningfully intervened on that apparatus than Benn Jordan, who EXPOSED the whole data collection system and BROKE the licence-plate-reading functionality on Flock Safety cameras in this video, then followed up by HACKING the entire 80,000-camera grid here. Everything else this year takes a back seat. The Rehearsal Season 2, Episode 3 ‘Pilot’s Code’, minutes 21 through 31 by Nathan Fielder Nathan Fielder’s The Rehearsal Season 2 might be the most multi-modal piece of media ever made. It’s so multi-modal that for 10 minutes in episode 3, he shifts into full-YouTuber fan-theory video-essay mode – but with two important twists. One: unlike the eisegetical crackpot nonsense that pollutes most of YouTube, I’m absolutely sold on Fielder’s Evanescence Hypothesis. Two: all of his corkboard-diagramming and cockpit-voice-recorder-timing are in the service of something beautiful: empathy for the private struggle of a public individual and the mental health epidemic hiding in plain sight behind it. All the jokes are serious, and that’s surpassingly rare and precious. Orwell: 2+2=5 by Raoul Peck While this film seems historically fated to not land with the urgency of Peck’s I Am Not Your Negro, that’s a shame – because the breadth of research, the adroit connections it makes to the present, and its empathy for Orwell’s life story are in all ways the equal of that great earlier work. Just when you think it’s only about propaganda and social control, it becomes about surveillance, AI (“The imagination will not breed in captivity” – Orwell), revolution, love, morality, and everything else that matters. This one speaks for itself. Panorama of Western State Penitentiary by Eli Jacob Boonin-Vail The best video essays exist at the junction of some set of concerns you didn’t previously realise intersected. This compact and impactful academic piece sits at the crossroads of contemporary film production, carceral technologies, media archaeology, and much more. What does it mean for a jail to be ‘well designed’? Why would we ever be happy to look at one? And yet from early cinema to the present we haven’t been able to stop aestheticising them. A worthwhile study, and maybe even a wake-up call. Why ChatGPT Can’t Draw a Full Glass of Wine by Alex O’Connor The best rumination on AI this year was Josh Geist’s You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.), but since I recognised him for his video on Winnie the Pooh and Candide a few years ago (still incredible!), this video offers another path through AI. From a simple question, posed in the title, Alex finds a new way to examine empiricism and potentially kickstart hundreds of Philosophy 101 discussions that haven’t been interesting to students in decades. I Solved Klotski by 2swap As a species, we went all-in on the eye. There’s almost no way we can meaningfully understand a set of numbers or the operation of a complex system directly. We have to invent a way to visualise it. I wish more video essayists started with that fundamental task: to find a new way to visualise something. It makes my year when someone makes something this jaw-droppingly gorgeous. What If We Made a Camera That Sees in Reverse? by Stuff Made Here For my final slot this year, I just want to shout-out all the ‘f*ck-around-and-find-out’ YouTubers who are still finding new ways of seeing things. Like Lensevision and his geometric camera filter experiments, Patrick Gillespie repeatedly blurring and sharpening an image, or, most amazingly, this video’s spinning camera rig that sees in unwrapped? reverse? perspective? behind things? … You really just have to see for yourself. Photography began with engineering. And it can be reborn every time an engineer decides to start from scratch again. It’s beautiful. Managing editor of Found Footage Magazine This 2025 short-list obviously fails to capture the full scope of the video essays that make critical use of found footage or pre-existing images. And the last year has brought an exceptional number of remarkable works. The titles highlighted here represent just one attempt to recognise video essays that engage meaningfully with the world around us. They tackle with creativity and courage global concerns such as the Palestinian conflict, racism, housing affordability, cultural heritage, collective identity or the inevitable ways in which mankind and technology interact. I hope this selection is a reminder of what we cannot miss. Another Other by Bex Oluwatoyin Thompson In a moment marked by fierce political polarization, a film like Another Other poses a lot of thought-provoking questions about profound social crisis and the right to freedom of expression in a democratic society. Houses We Can Own by Susana Bessa A fascination with the way houses are depicted in the movies becomes a video essay that reflects on how the environments we occupy influence personal experiences, beliefs and achievements. Houses We Can Own is a video essay which considers how architecture and spatial environments shape our identities and the narratives we build around our lives. The Sorrow of the Lynx by Michaela Grill Contemporary art plays an essential role in confronting the climate emergency. Michaela Grill’s The Sorrow of the Lynx delves into the natural world of Siberia to explore how this expansive ecosystem is being transformed by the growing pressures of global warming and man-made disasters, from widespread woodland fires to other environmental disruptions. Human Movie: Six Meditations on a Compression Algorithm by Eryk Salvaggio Blending glitched AI-generated imagery with archival images, Eryk Salvaggio’s work sheds light on how cognitive processes are simulated, onto how human consciousness is being emulated and imprisoned in today’s modern digital landscape. The Force by Wilma Stone I particularly like The Force. Wilma Stone’s video essay, while grounded in scholarship, is fully compatible with a work process that embraces a poetic approach to the archive to tell how colonial histories erase local knowledge, heritage, and identity. Film curator/Film studies PhD candidate (University of St Andrews) A mix of works I’m grateful to have discovered this year, including some unorthodox choices that share the critical and formal sensibilities at work in the liveliest and most perceptive video essays, and that perhaps hint at promising directions for the form. Flesh & Ghost by Sky Hopinka A transporting film of ghosts, flesh and echoes, which like many of Hopinka’s works, offers ways to feel for all that shimmers at the limits of knowing. A looped two-channel video, alive with the music of Courtney Asztalos, it approaches cycles of loss and return, grief and gratitude, through a Hočąk story, VHS tapes from Hopinka’s youth, and the shifting motions of poetry, myth, and memory. just above the tear duct on each side by Cat and Éiméar McClay Fragmenting texts found in the archival materials of the defunct St. Conal’s Psychiatric Hospital in Letterkenny, this singular work looks closely behind the harrowing statistic that during the 1950s, Ireland had the highest rate of psychiatric hospital use in the world. The imbrications of colonial and carceral logics with local social and religious dynamics interact with staggering force with the quiet, animated digital renditions of the dilapidated, life-crushing spaces that once housed them. Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place by Catalina Segú A vivid and affecting work about the interplay of sensing and being sensed by places, tracing the shifting limits of control when retrieving certain memories, where mechanisms of forgetting are dissolved and undone by the flesh. Through an exquisite sense of pace, the video essay gathers footage from Segú’s family video archives, military marches and parades from the Chilean dictatorship, TV shows, and a sensitive return to scenes from Lucrecia Martel’s films. Like the gesture it circles – a child jumping in a swimming pool without hesitation, Segú’s own, echoed in La cienega – the work moves between the surface and depths of personal and collective experiences, which shape the body. အသွင်ပြောင်းလဲမှုတစ်ခု/A Metamorphosis by Lin Htet Aung A restructuring of state television propaganda from Myanmar’s dictatorship into a formally exciting and unsettling broadcast. The work tends towards playful abstraction, where the official colours of the national flag interact with other colours that allude to new possibilities. Familiar language and images are retuned as elusive visuals and unnerving lullabies (using AI trained on the voice of the military dictator), which eschew footage of protests and state violence but retain an affective texture attuned to both the subtle and blatant workings of propaganda. A Brief History of Chasing Storms by Curtis Miller The tornado as destructive weather, visual icon, a thrilling and tragic event, linked to climate change, disaster capitalism, and mythologies of American film culture. A tactile and expansive work that balances memorable anecdotes with a range of archival materials. It organises stories teased from repeated journeys across the ‘Tornado Alley’ of the American Midwest into discrete episodes, while inviting sound to carry the work in open and surprising ways, engaging the iconic imagery of tornadoes and the anxieties and imaginaries they evoke with generous, critical, and moving depth. Artist, filmmaker and PhD student at the Faculty of Fine Arts (Brno University of Technology – VUT) Confession: This year, I haven’t seen nearly as many video essays as I used to. For this reason, my selection is eclectic and personal. It is not meant to be a selection of the so-called objectively best, but rather of what won me over the moment I encountered it. How Not to Remember Our Bodies by Lucie Rosenfeldová An impressive deconstruction of historical materials, supplemented by the author’s photographs, animations, and visualizations, deals with women’s reproductive rights in socialist Czechoslovakia. Unspectacular, but all the more disturbing and uncompromising. It raises fundamental questions about the autonomy of the female body in relation to bureaucracy and patriarchy. “What is ‘we’ when we say ‘ours’?” How Comedy Was Destroyed by an Anti-Reality Doomsday Cult by The Elephant Graveyard An answer to the question: Why did comedy get so shitty? Together with the creator of The Elephant Graveyard, you can dive into a deep rabbit hole where you will explore everything that the manosphere, Roganosphere, toxicity, alt-right, conspirituality, and the cult practices of charismatic but stupid leaders mean. You will see the world behind the mirror, as described by Naomi Klein in her book Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World. Towards Eremos: Form, Emptiness, Posthumanism by Jáchym Šidlák The video essay attempts to describe the viewer’s experience of watching a film that seeks to adopt a posthumanist and more-than-human perspective. This is a difficult task on both levels. Judge for yourself how well it succeeds. Or rather, experience it for yourself. Head of the University of Massachusetts Film Studies Program The ParAIax View by Ariel Avissar Ariel Avissar is one of the most inventive and transformative video­essayists working today. (I could fill my entire poll with works by Ariel Avissar.) With This Is Not What I Normally Do he had already pushed the form into territories that felt unprecedented – often with conceptual audacity. The ParAIax View marks yet another leap forward. Here, Avissar invites AI systems to reimagine the notorious brainwashing montage from The Parallax View (1974), not as a simple remake but as a probing test of what happens when machinic hallucination encounters one of cinema’s most disturbing political visions. The result is quite mesmerising, revealing new tensions, distortions, and interpretive slippages that emerge when human intention meets algorithmic generation. And of course, this comes on the heels of his spectacular earlier Parallax View Piece (Laird’s Constraint) (forthcoming in Screenworks). See Under: Orient by Colleen Laird Colleen Laird’s first video essay Eye–Camera–Ninagawa was an absolute virtuoso deconstruction of the opening montage of Ninagawa’s Helter Skelter – so dazzling in its precision, originality, and skill that one might have thought it her opera maestra. We were not surprised by the string of similarly commanding works following it (she is such a brilliant videoessayist), yet it was hard to believe she could surpass it. And yet her latest video essay, See Under: Orient, goes beyond everything one could have anticipated. It is a work of breathtaking beauty and brilliance: a seamless fusion of sound, rhythm, and colour, carried by a theoretical sophistication that never weighs down its sensorial force. The piece marks a new pinnacle in Laird’s already extraordinary videographic practice – and one can only imagine that even greater achievements lie ahead. Pausas\Pauses by Rachel Randall and Catherine Grant Pausas/Pauses is a beautiful exploration of a gesture that recurs across contemporary Latin American cinema yet often slips past critical attention: the fleeting moments in which domestic, cleaning, and care workers momentarily step out of their demands and inhabit a fragile space of inwardness. Rachel Randall and Catherine Grant gather these slivers of rest – from windowsill gazes to sunlit pauses during commutes – and let them speak to each other through videographic montage, revealing a shared emotional register that written scholarship has largely overlooked. By placing scenes from seven films into conversation, they illuminate how these works imagine the workers’ inner worlds, even as those vantage points remain partially inaccessible to the filmmakers themselves. The result is a video essay that not only uncovers a quiet but persistent visual motif, but also brilliantly reflects on classed and gendered asymmetries of leisure. Pausas becomes, in this sense, a meditation on who is afforded the luxury to pause – and who must steal it. Painful Cinephilia: Daney, Rivette, Video and Kapó by Alan O’Leary Alan O’Leary is one of the most remarkable figures in videographic criticism. His work consistently combines rigor and creativity, producing video essays that are as intellectually compelling as they are aesthetically captivating. Selecting a single piece of his for this poll borders on the absurd: each one feels like a fully realised achievement, and the sheer breadth and vitality of his output mean that there is always a new gem to discover. From the ethical and formal subtlety of Painful Cinephilia: Daney, Rivette, Video, and Kapó, to the analytical playfulness of Classif. & Me (Laird’s Constraint), or the exquisite formal precision of Canister in Close Up (Payne’s Constraint) (these last two produced for Avissar’s Parametric Summer Series), to the collective ingenuity of Om Shanti Omnibus, produced in collaboration with the other members of IVERN, O’Leary’s oeuvre is consistently impressive. Any one of these works could easily stand as a landmark in videographic practice, yet together they demonstrate a rare, sustained mastery that continually expands the possibilities of the form. Potbelly by Dayna McLeod Dayna McLeod has an extraordinary talent for using humour as a powerful critical instrument for her feminist intervention – her humour is very sharp, and theoretically rich. In Potbelly – as also in Age Perfect, another brilliant video essay she produced this year – she distills complex debates in aging and gender into short pieces that have the power of carrying the force of entire scholarly articles. What might take pages of academic prose, McLeod conveys through wit, performance, and an unflinching attention to how older women’s bodies are read, regulated, and stereotyped. Her comedy never softens the critique; instead, it opens a conceptual space where laughter becomes a form of resistance and a method of knowing. These pieces are miniature in duration but expansive in impact – proof that videographic insight can be both concise and powerfully transformative (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson In (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly, Lucy Fife Donaldson treats brilliantly the videographic form itself as a queer methodology, exploring how horror films disrupt spatial and bodily norms to produce disorientation that can be both unsettling and generative. Drawing on Sara Ahmed’s and Jennifer M. Barker’s ideas of embodied orientation, the essay traces moments – from the drone shot in Midsommar to camera movements in The Shining, The Descent, and other genre examples – that invert, twist, and destabilise the viewer’s sense of verticality and linearity. The piece demonstrates how the video essay can make theoretical insights tangible, turning the sensory intensity of horror into a reflection on queerness, embodiment, and the potential for new orientations in both film and life. Winner of the 2025 Marienbad Film Festival Audiovisual Essay Award, it exemplifies how critical practice can inhabit, rather than resolve, the pleasures and provocations of disorientation. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur is a compelling investigation of the porous boundaries between academic analysis and creative practice, fiction and documentary, biography and autobiography. The video essay uses Varda’s film as a lens to explore how these categories intersect, allowing personal reflection and formal experimentation to illuminate one another. In just over seven minutes, it demonstrates how videographic work can enact the very concepts it theorises, producing insights that written scholarship alone might struggle to convey. Recognised with the Audiovisual Essay Award at the 2025 Marienbad Film Festival, this piece exemplifies how videography can blend rigor, artistry, and self-reflexivity in a seamless, evocative form. The voters on this poll were given the option to highlight ‘emerging voices’ in the video essay community. Some contributors chose to direct readers to specific videos, while others focused on an essayist’s whole body of work. Allie Meowy (nominated by Willow Q. Petri) Allie Meowy takes the deepest dives from angles you would never expect that are both hilarious and heartwarming in their sincerity. Amber Flannery Field (nominated by Clare O’Gara) I may be cheating slightly here, since Field has already created and published video essay-adjacent content on TikTok for several years. Given that she’s also been teasing a pivot to long-form YouTube video essays recently, though, I wanted to include her. Field is, in her own words, “the only good tour guide in New York City,” and her videos, which explore race, gender, popular culture, politics, community organising, the spaces and places of Washington DC and New York, and all the overlaps therein, are among the most compelling I’ve ever seen on TikTok. I’ve also never been more impressed by a person’s ability to unflinchingly deliver thought- and heart-wrenching commentary to a camera in so many different ways in so many different public places. Aurélie Coop (nominated by Lucy Fife Donaldson) Aurélie is in her final year at St Andrews, and produced a brilliant audiovisual essay for my course last year. Inspired by a range of sources, it draws on the range of audiovisual essay making in really inventive ways, while doing something distinctive and fresh. I’m very excited to see what she will make next! Casey Explosion (nominated by Willow Q. Petri) If you enjoy games and do not know who Casey Explosion is, you are missing out on some incredible recommendations. She has brought her thoughtful love of games to YouTube with some incredible videos. Celia Sainz (nominated by Alan O’Leary) Celia Sainz received her PhD this year from Mass Amherst, where she worked with Barbara Zecchi. Currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Spanish at Williams College, she has already made herself a leading light in videographic ecocriticism (did she invent the term?). I think her non-anthropocentric approach to videographic film studies, as evidenced in video essays like KELLY REICHARDT’S BESTIARIO (published in [in]Transition), will be increasingly prominent. Comma Splice (nominated by Hizzy Hay) Great visual animations paired with strong analysis of a YouTube medium I had no familiarity with, yet still found really engaging. Creative Destruction Video (nominated by J. Nicholas Geist) The lyric essay in creative nonfiction gets a lot of pushback from all sides, because it refuses to accept a bright line between poetry and prose, or between fiction and nonfiction. But from those complicated, messy areas of overlap arise many of my favourite essays. I haven’t really seen anyone attempting to bring the lyric essay to the video space until I saw Creative Destruction’s Fugue State Waltz. He has continued to infuse the video essay with the lyric in his Jason Voorhees: Reagan’s Golem. His more experimental essays are challenging to both viewers and, unfortunately, the algorithm. I hope he continues down this path, though, because he is making some of the most interesting and exciting video essays I’ve seen. Dex Veitch (nominated by Lucy Fife Donaldson) Dex Veitch is a junior at UMass Amherst majoring in Comp Lit and Film Studies. His video essay The Cinematic Scar: Reconceptualizing Suture Theory won second place in the Michael S. Roif Award in Film Studies for Best Video Essay in 2025, and after seeing his embodiment exercises on Orphée, I was really impressed by their expressive density. Elsie Walker (nominated by Catherine Grant) Elsie is the second of two established scholars who, as a recent alumni of the Middlebury Workshop on Scholarship in Sound and Image, made a great impact as new video essayists on this year’s Adelio Ferrero Award for Video Essays. Elsie’s highly personal and moving video essay A Beautiful Day in the Tree of Life received an honourable mention. Eva Alvarez Vazquez (nominated by Alison Peirse) Her sound work is smart, corporeal, and effective. I can’t wait to see what she does next. HeyItMeBen (nominated by Denis (LambHoot)) 2025 marked Ben’s triumphant return after a year-long hiatus. His piece Searching for Hope in Iron Lung explores themes of desperation, illness, and hope. The piece examines a couple of examples that bridge the virtual and real worlds. Johanna Gustin (nominated by Kevin B. Lee) Gustin is a filmmaker and graduate student at the Stanford Documentary programme. Her desktop documentary I Think About Birds is a fascinating and ultimately breathtaking desktop documentary that draws surprising ties between manosphere/tradwife videos, nature documentaries and her own family yearnings. josh (with parentheses) (nominated by Denis (LambHoot)) Josh’s ‘let me share my screen’ approach is such a compelling storytelling technique. It’s easy to get immersed in these videos, which is strange since there’s literally an interface sitting between audience and topic. Maybe there’s something skeuomorphic going on (watching a video on a computer of a computer’s interface). We’ve forgotten how to forget and You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) are great demonstrations of Josh’s signature style. Katarzyna Paszkiewicz (nominated by Alison Peirse) I’ve long admired Katarzyna Paszkiewicz’s cutting edge work in feminist film studies, and it is tremendously exciting to see this major scholar beginning to think videographically. Her style is cool and calm, a balm for the overstimulated. Katarzyna Paszkiewicz (nominated by Catherine Grant) Katarzyna’s amazing video essay Environmental Time, which she began working on while learning to edit at the Middlebury Workshop, was published by the Spanish academic journal Teknokultura. Revista de Cultura Digital y Movimientos Sociales in 2025. It brilliantly juxtaposes selected footage from Nomadland (2020) and Anthropocene: The Human Epoch (2018) to explore the films’ hauntological landscapes. It’s a powerful and important work and I cannot wait for more video essays by her to enter the public sphere. Laura Del Vecchio & Katarzyna Paszkiewicz (nominated by Maria Hofmann) The collaboration between Laura Del Vecchio, a multidisciplinary researcher, artist, musician, editor and translator, and Katarzyna Paszkiewicz, Associate Professor in English and Film Studies at the University of the Balearic Islands, on a rumble from the core of the earth, that elegantly brings together scholarly rigor and creative expression, makes me excited for any future works by them. Lilith Grasmug (nominated by Delphine Jeanneret) Lilith Grasmug is an Austrian actress born in Paris. In 2017, she starred in Virgil Vernier’s Sophia Antipolis before working with Jean-Christophe Meurisse, Mikhaël Hers, Carmen Jaquier, and Claire Burger. After studying at the ECAL film department in Lausanne, she is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in contemporary art research at the Sorbonne, under the supervision of Elvan Zabunyan. Some of You Fucked Eva is her first short film as a director. Linia Verde (nominated by Jiří Anger) A group of Romanian students, mentored by Ana Szel and Liri Chapelan, created a remarkable collection of video essays on the themes of hyperobjects and ecocriticism. Published in Film a doba under the title A Small Batch of Irrepresentable Entities, this collection displays a playfulness and an engagement with topics that reach beyond strict film studies toward the environmental humanities – both of which are more than welcome. Marine de Dardel (nominated by Kevin B. Lee) de Dardel is a doctoral researcher working with me and Johannes Binotto, and her videographic work makes bold experiments with textual, audiovisual and verbal language. The Colour Out of Space (linked above) uses creative coding to programme a future iteration of Locarno Film Festival using a dataset derived from the festival. Her other works of this year, (DES)ASTRES.ai and Promontorium Somnii (Post Mortem) each reveal distinctly different possibilities for videographic approaches to generative AI. Marta Cerón León (nominated by Dayna McLeod) I had the pleasure of working with Marta and some other incredible students in the Film Studies programme at the University of Massachusetts Amherst this fall where they are making really great work. In Embodied Sound, a brittle and crunchy soundscape reframes the pharmacy scene in Vuk Lungulov-Klotz’s 2023 Mutt, where the protagonist walks the aisles while on the phone. As Marta says, “the sound makes the space feel prescriptive, as if the drugs themselves speak or were making sounds while framing the body.” In two of her other videos that also work with Mutt – Supercut and OnScreen Cameo – Marta intervenes in scenes to show us how the main character is constantly framed, contained, and surveilled. Keep an eye out for Marta’s work! Maud Ceuterick (nominated by Alan O’Leary) Maud Ceuterick has published just two video essays so far, I think, but they are different enough, and so interesting in their individual ways, that they announce an important maker. The ferocious RAWR: Kitchen Rage Judith and I was published last year in Teknokultura. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen abjection mobilised like this in a scholarly context. Filming Out Loud, made in dialogue with the anthropologist Carola Ludovica Giannotti Mura and published in Academic Quarter, interrogates the epistemic and ethical affordances of videographic criticism with sensitivity and reflexive intelligence. May Santiago (nominated by Alan O’Leary) May Santiago, a performance academic based in Baltimore, has already been nominated multiple times for this poll. She describes her PhD work as archiving as activism, or as a counter to the colonial archive of Puerto Rico. Video essays such as Desidentificación (published in Burges and Cooper’s Personal Mediascapes collection) and Agencia (presented at SCMS in Chicago this year), combine archival and performative material, self-generated footage and personal revelation. They are incredibly intense and somehow intensely glamorous. Noa Epars & Marvin Merkel (nominated by Delphine Jeanneret) Born in 1998 in Penthalaz, he is of Swiss origin. After obtaining a bachelor’s degree in French Literature and History at the University of Lausanne, he began studying cinema at the HEAD – Geneva (University of Art and Design) in 2021. In 2022, he co-directed Serafina, presented in official competition at the 75th Locarno Film Festival and at the New Directors/New Films Festival at the MoMA. The same year, he directed The Misanthrope, presented in several European festivals. Marvin Merkel is a Lausanne-based artist who combines photography with his sculptural and performative work. The nominator specifically highlighted their newest piece, Always Wanted to Be God, Never Wanted to Do Good. Renegade Cut (nominated by Willow Q. Petri) While he has been making videos for a long time, his recent pivot into making whatever he wants has been an incredible creative inspiration to what video essays can be. Rotem Sudman (nominated by Colleen Laird) Rotem Sudman is an extraordinarily promising emerging voice whose work moves with equal measures of young intellectual rigor and technical precision informed by moral courage and a palpably bursting heart. My first encounter with her videographic essay was through her entry on Terrace House in the TV Dictionary series (published in [in]Transition), which I reviewed. Sudman is a deft editor, but she is also something rarer: a maker who understands the video essay as a method of critical witnessing. Her ongoing research demonstrates a profound commitment to rethinking film’s relationship to history, memory, political struggle, and stakes. Sudman brings a perspective that is both ethically attuned and urgently needed. Forthcoming in 2026 peer-reviewed publications, her efforts confront the violences operational in archival erasure while offering space for counter-narratives to emerge. Sudman’s work gives me hope. Salomé Aguilera Skvirsky (nominated by Catherine Grant) Salomé is one of two established scholars who, as recent alumna of the Middlebury Workshop on Scholarship in Sound and Image, made a great impact as new video essayists on this year’s Adelio Ferrero Award for Video Essays. Salomé’s astonishingly original work Our Morals and Theirs on the Chilean film El chacal de Nahueltoro (Miguel Littín, 1969) took first prize. Samantha Wojcik (nominated by Jenny Oyallon-Koloski) Samantha’s work, inspired by Agnès Varda’s The Gleaners and I, was in high consideration for the first annual graduate student video essay award organised through the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, judged by myself, Allison Cooper (Bowdoin College), and Andrea Comiskey (Carnegie Mellon University). She uses an expanded definition of ‘gleaning’ to take the spectator on a joyous, eclectic tour of queer and queer-adjacent imagery, concluding with an exhilarating performance in the desktop documentary form. Sarah Davis Baker (nominated by Dan Schindel) Baker has come out of the gate as a video essayist with some really strong stuff this year. She’s very thoughtful and has done a great job of finding novel topics and approaching them from unexpected angles. Check out The Internet Used to Be a Place. Silvia Cipelletti (nominated by Kevin B. Lee) Cipelletti is part of my research group and in 2025 really came into her own with several video essays, Mediterranean Border and Algorithmic Borders (later adapted into a segment for the TV series PhantasIA), which are part of her doctoral dissertation research on videographic approaches to border landscapes, and her collaboration with Evelyn Kreutzer Locarno parla italiano – 404!: Glitching Locarno Film Festival explored the divided realities under the surface of a celebratory event. All these works demonstrate an energetic and self-exposing approach to negotiating between desktop and ethnographic field research. Therapist Plus Gamer (nominated by Denis (LambHoot)) Jared (Therapist Plus Gamer) has been doing one of my favourite things on this platform: bringing real-life professional expertise into video essays. I’m glad he finds the time to be so productive at crafting well-made, educational, and entertaining videos. Watching his latest piece during lunch is a ritual I look forward to every week. Timothée Engasser (nominated by Delphine Jeanneret) Born in Saint-Sébastien-sur-Loire in 1991, Timothée Engasser lives and works between Marseille and Lille. A graduate in urban sociology with a thesis in research and creation (ENSAV/Université du Mirail), he has pursued the themes of his research in cinematographic works on the edge of reality, between documentary and experimental. His films include Tenace, Il y a un endroit dans la nuit and Omens bloom in the dark, which have been screened at a number of international festivals (International Kurzfilmtage Winterthur, Les Yeux ouverts, Entrevues de Belfort, FRAC Grand Large). He seeks to explore the imaginary worlds among traces, ruins and gaps. The nominator specifically highlighted their piece, Home Is Where the Heart Is. Tingyu Chen (nominated by Jenny Oyallon-Koloski) Tingyu’s videographic analysis of Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman was highly ranked by Allison Cooper (Bowdoin College), Andrea Comiskey (Carnegie Mellon University), and myself for the first annual graduate student video essay award organised through the Society for Cinema and Media Studies. This ambitious project intensifies the film’s spatial qualities using deformative methods to expand our understanding of a film better known for its durational representation of women’s labor. Toni’s Film Club (nominated by Queline Meadows) While Toni has been releasing videos for a few years now, he seemed to really hit his stride in 2025. He puts a ton of effort into everything he makes (many of his recent videos include interviews) and I can’t wait to see what he does next. Valeria Villegas Lindvall (nominated by Alison Peirse) A major new thinker in decolonial horror criticism, Valeria Villegas Lindvall is now finding her voice in videographic criticism. And that voice is raw punk energy. weisensei (nominated by Hizzy Hay) A video essayist with a background as a story artist, which provides a unique perspective on what makes media excel.

Title: Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI

Time Published: 2025-12-25T00:53:24Z
Full Content:
Written & Edited byOihyun Kim NVIDIA has agreed to pay approximately $20 billion to acquire assets from artificial intelligence chip startup Groq, marking the company’s largest transaction on record and continuing its strategy of absorbing potential competitors before they can challenge its market dominance. The chipmaker’s latest licensing deal mirrors a similar transaction just three months ago, reinforcing the narrative that decentralized AI infrastructure may offer the only alternative to Nvidia’s growing dominance. The deal closed just three months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation—a round that included BlackRock, Samsung, Cisco, and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. serves as a partner. Nvidia is acquiring all of the company’s assets substantially, except its cloud computing business, though Groq framed the transaction as a “non-exclusive licensing agreement.” Groq CEO Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who helped create the search giant’s Tensor Processing Unit, will join Nvidia along with president Sunny Madra and other senior executives. The startup will continue operating independently under CFO Simon Edwards as its new chief executive. The Groq transaction follows a pattern Nvidia established just three months earlier. In September, the company paid over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and employees while licensing the startup’s technology. Both deals use licensing structures rather than outright acquisitions, potentially avoiding the antitrust scrutiny that blocked Nvidia’s $40 billion bid for Arm Holdings in 2022. The Kobeissi Letter summarized Nvidia’s approach bluntly: “We will buy you before you can compete with us.” Nvidia's newest strategy:"We will buy you before you can compete with us."There has never been a company like Nvidia. https://t.co/wsbuAgIqyM Groq’s Language Processing Unit uses on-chip SRAM rather than external DRAM, enabling what the company claims is up to 10x better energy efficiency. This architecture excels at real-time inference but limits model size—a tradeoff Nvidia can now explore within its broader ecosystem. The timing is notable. Google recently unveiled its seventh-generation TPU, codenamed Ironwood, and released Gemini 3, trained entirely on TPUs, to top benchmark rankings. Nvidia responded on X: “We’re delighted by Google’s success… NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry—it’s the only platform that runs every AI model.” When incumbents start issuing such reassurance statements, competitive pressure is clearly mounting. While the deal has no direct impact on cryptocurrency markets, it reinforces the narrative driving decentralized AI computing projects. Platforms like io.net position themselves as alternatives to centralized AI infrastructure. “People can put their own supply onto a network, whether that’s data centers or yourself with your laptop, contributing your available GPU power, and getting fairly compensated for it using tokenomics,” Jack Collier, io.net’s Chief Growth Officer, told BeInCrypto. The platform claims enterprise clients, including Leonardo.ai and UC Berkeley, have achieved significant cost savings. However, the gap between narrative and reality remains wide. Nvidia’s acquisition of Groq’s low-latency technology further extends its technical lead, making it harder for any alternative to offer competitive performance. The transaction also raises questions about independent AI chip development. Cerebras Systems, another Nvidia competitor preparing an IPO, may eventually face similar pressure. Whether it can remain independent or succumb to Nvidia’s financial gravity remains to be seen.
